2,"This is not what I expected from such a gifted artist as Jaheim, did he change producers? The music and the man with the voice didn't go together well for me.  This is one I will not be purchasing, it is a serious down grade from his previous two albums. Better luck next time, Jaheim I was truly disappointed."
1,"This is not the music from the movie. This purchase was a Major dissapointment. You would do beter searching for the music credits for titles, then download the tracks form your music subscriber"
1,"Get's one star in appreciation of the technicians who had to record the cd. What a mess! Never should have been made. Even Julie is way past the point of playing this onstage. She half talks her way through her songs, her voice clearly not what it was when she made the film. Sorry Julie, should have left it alone.  The rest of the cast is not on a par with the film. Tony Roberts in place of Robert Preston...not on his best day. Leslie Ann Warren was riotuosly original in the film, Rachel York trying to copy her, is not. And Michael Nouri? Dismal. The songs added to the score for the stage.......forget it. Not even worth mentioning any more. Goes into the WHAT WERE THEY THINKING? file. As for Julie refusing her Tony nomination because the rest of the show was overlooked? C'mon Julie, there was a reason for that, the show SUCKED!"
1,"Layla is one of the most overrated songs of all time. Cream is one of the most boring bands in history. Why not do yourself a favour and buy enjoyable bands like Dire Straits, and Metallica who rock.  PS.This Clapton compilation has no good songs so please don't buy it at all"
1,"I don't understand the previous reviews - I found this recording positively dreadful, with Ruthie Henshall being the only one worth listening to. John Sinclair is abominable as George - he sounds like he's doing a (bad) imitation of Michael Crawford in &quot;Hello, Dolly.&quot; He does strange things to his words - I guess he's trying not to sound British, but why is he singing &quot;Summ-ar weath-ar&quot; instead of &quot;summer weather&quot;?    The Ilona is a bass - almost literally. &quot;I Resolve&quot; has been lowered for her, and yet she still cannot master the range of the song. To accomodate her, the second part of &quot;I Don't Know His Name&quot; has a truly odd key change. Were she remotely talented I could understand key changes to facilitate her singing, but she's not worth it.    The orchestrations are odd, too, with strange sleigh bell sounds appearing frequently. The rest of the singers range from fair (Kodaly - a pretty voice but not much expression) to bad (Mr. Maraczek drags down EVERY SINGLE NOTE of &quot;Days Gone By.&quot; Luckily this is his only song.)    The Broadway revival, to my ear, still has the best voices, except, of course, that Barbara Cook (the original) outshines Diane Fratantoni, who is merely good (but who was a vast improvement over the Roundabout's original Amalia, the annoying Judy Kuhn.)     Get the original or revival recordings instead - this London version I would recommend only to die-hard SHE LOVES ME fans, or masochists. I'd rather sit through another terrible viewing of &quot;You've Got Mail&quot; than listen to this again"
1,"When I think of the sex pistols, I think the Monkeys did it better as a boy band. Let's face it, dears, that is all the sex pistols were: a marketing ploy. They are f-----g NSync for another generation"
2,This collection of 15 great hits of Nicola Di Bari in spanish is missing one of his most (if not the most) important and popular song: &quot;Lisa de los ojos azules&quot;. I wouldn't buy this CD without that song
1,"I can't fathom why anyone would enjoy this album. The lyrics must have come out of a Dadaist poetry circle, and (most of) the guitar work is completely without personality.  What is the criterion of a good rock album? By any standards it must be a joy to play it. 6teen Stone misses the mark by such dimensions one must assume it was intentional. But it doesn't so much incite anger than it does disdain for Bush's attempts to emulate Nirvana. Where Nirvana has clearly enunciated guitar riffs and minimalist, evocative lyrics, Bush has dull, throbbing guitar drones that project nothing to the listener but a kind of malaise-inspired anger.  There's not much more to say about 6teen Stone. I could tell you about the embarrassment of listening to the lyrics on songs like ""Swim"": Thinning ice / 14 Hairdryers / Swimming to you / Flame on earth desire."" Or the artistic suicide of the last track, ""X-Girlfriend"", a song composed of a little guitar-wailing and a non-stop chorus that's about six words long.  That's about all I can tell you. Mostly I figure I've done enough warning to let you make your own choice. If you do attempt this though, you ought to be told the little good news that there is: there are about 5 minutes of good music are contained on the album, split between ""Machinehead"" and ""Glycerine."" The first is an energetic, well-constructed song about control (you might have seen the music video for it about 11 years ago on Total Request Live), the second a serenade featuring over-dubbed guitars, a trembling cello, and a surprisingly coherent Rossdale. They hold the album; about as well as a couple of floor joists can hold a crumbling building."
1,There is a reason why you cannot listen to any tracks on Amazon- you wouldn't buy if you could. I read a number of reviews and figured that it was worth a try given that Metallica was mentioned as being similar in some small way. This band is nothing even near Metallica. I have thrown the disk away- don't bother
2,"I've always seen Sheryl Crow as a middle-of-the-road rock artist.   My wife and I got a couple of her disc's, plus that ""very best of"" CD and was really looking forward to her latest, but this one...zzzzzzzz, makes me wonder what they're putting in Sheryl's coffee.   Some reviewers are saying there's ""heart and soul"" all over this album?  That may be, but it's also very slick dullsville stuff too.   As for the album cover graphics, I don't see the Roger Dean Yes covers or the 60's style psychedelia like one reviewer wrote, but a very ""modern"" graphic art that lots of artists and bands have been using. Kelly Clarkson, the Vines, the Donnas, the list goes on.  Highlights: Good is Good (I guess it's time for a new ""very best of"" collection)"
1,Please change your name to (KID RAP)..  When you start producing true ROCK cd's then and only then you should put rock back into your fake name...  Stop playing both sides..  I realize that the rap- hip hop scene is much easier because over half the fan base is little girls /boys and people that dont have a clue what music is all about..  Do yourself a favor and take the rap/hip hop out of your so called music. One day you will realize that the rap/hip hop scene is like a bad smell that real music fans hate and wish would go away..          
1,When will amazon allow a zero stars rating????
1,"If you have children that are five years & younger, this would be a good album to put in your child's boom box or get it in cassette for their tape player.  but if your children are six and up.  Your better off finding the real songs and burning them if you can find these songs.  This album should be saved strictly for the poor folks who wnat music for their kids but cannot afford it.  This ablum would be number 1 if it were sold in Rwanda, Sudan or other third world nations since it could be sold for like dirt cheap.  Parents, if you buy this album, after your children turn 6 years old.  pack this CD and other Ki8dz Bop CD's and send them to Africa.  This is Pop music for impoverished folks"
2,"Ok, first off, this is the first Corrs release i've listenend to. I'm offering my opinion without knowing anything else they may have done. I've listened to the cd 10 times or so, on random occasions when i need a break from my normal diet of punk and garage rock.  It sounds good. A little TOO good. I agree that it's overproduced, doesn't sound even remotely spontaneous. The studio work is well done, but OVERdone. I'd like to hear something else to see what they REALLY sound like.  The content of the songs is what bothers me. Aside from being sappy, sentimental drivvel (this is pop music, after all - i wasn't expecting anything else), everything sounds like a commercial ditty or a part of a movie soundtrack. Mmm-hmm.  Track 1 - I see a not-so overweight soccermom smiling on a treadmill at Curves(TM), then hopping in the Ford Expedition(TM), and cheering on the kids at their soccer game with a SunnyD(TM) in each hand.  Track 2 - Helicopter pans out as mid-20's girl drives curvy mountain road in VW Cabrio(TM)(R) with top down, thinking about handsome lover... ""LMN""(R) watermark in lower-right corner of screen...  Track 3 - Sad animals. Images of puppys in cages.  Track 4 - Actually, I like this one. Mellow, laid back.  Track 5 - Ugh.  Track 6 - This one is the MOST clever! I see the band members - 3 girls, 1 guy - on one side of a table under a hanging lamp in an otherwise black room, while 3 gentlemen in suits open a breifcase full of money, push it towards them and say, ""As you're aware, the radio has lost it's credibility. The kids are figuring out that there are other bands out there, beside what we pump across the airwaves at them. We need to entice them back. If you want a single, and this pile of cash says you do, then you'll do what you can to save this dying medium. Hell, you work in the word ""radio"" and we'll double what we're giving you."" Come on, the song even SOUNDS like a PSA for the International Radio Marketing Council...  Track 7 - Sounds like a Pepsi commercial.  Track 8 - Ugh. Wait, wasn't this Track 5?  Track 9 - Sappy, but ok. Sounds like they actually put effort into the lyrics. Thumbs up.  Track 10 - Not remotely original, but alright.  Track 11 - Interesting sound. Good beat. Correct me if i'm worng, but was that a semi-Pagan reference there? That would be a bold move, for which i'd applaud them, if in fact it is. Not that i'm Pagan or anything, but hey, its a religiously positive, non-Christian reference that doesn't involve Marilyn Manson, and that takes guts. Especially for radio-loving girls bands.  Track 12 - Laid back. Almost has a jazzy, lounge feel.  Track 13 - Produced by former Ace of Base member? Bubbly, upbeat, not too bad.  Track 14 - Written and produced by Avril Lavigne...  Track 15 - WOW! A RELATIVELY CELTIC-SOUNDING SONG FROM A RELATIVELY CELTIC BAND!! And instrumental, too - big thumbs up! In fact, maybe that's the key.  Whatever. Long-winded, i know, but fair. This album didn't turn me off to the Corrs completely, but i don't have very high hopes now.  Flame away, kiddies."
2,"I live in Buffalo and I'm a big prog rock fan; so when I saw this CD at the library, I knew I had to give it a free listen.   But make no mistake - this CD under-delivers on many levels.    I always wanted Asia to be a great band - it had my favorite guitar player (Steve Howe), a top-shelf drummer (Carl Palmer), and a proven bass player/vocalist who was up to the task (John Wetton).  But there was always a bit too much ""pop"", simplicity and repetition in their music to totally engage me.  Hey, progressive rock is mostly about ""different"", complexity and change, right?  Asia was a progressive-pop band (akin to the later albums of Todd Rundgren's Utopia) that made good music, but didn't really pioneer much of anything.    Same with this CD.  There's little here that's new or better than the studio versions of the songs.  Palmer's long drum solo got boring after a while.  Steve's acoustic solos can be found on other Yes recordings, and done much better there  -  here, the recording quality is so bad that it sounds like he's playing tuned rubber bands at times.  (Honestly, I remember hearing better fidelity from my old Kenner Close'n'Play!)  O.K., it WAS cool to hear Steve express his pleasure at playing in Buffalo again!  But the so-called ""keyboard solo"" by Geoff Downs was underwhelming to say the least, and reinforced my suspicion that he was sort of the weak link in this group of otherwise great prog virtuosos.    I guess if one loves a band too much, they can blindly overlook some shortcomings on almost any CD by that band, and that's just fine for those people.  However, the OBJECTIVE reality of this CD's value comes creeping in on many other's existing reviews:  namely, the production quality is sub-par (to the point of being annoying at times); the vocals and harmonies are often off-key (you really shouldn't have to wince this much during 79 minutes of music!); this is clearly a single disk album that was issued on 2 disks for some reason; the packaging and liner notes are scant; and the performance just doesn't add much to the studio versions.  This is for Asia completists only.    Asia did make a solid 5-star progressive-pop CD with their first studio album.  I love it.  But they never improved upon it, and never stretched out into new territory.  Perhaps this 1982 live recording exposes some of the weaknesses that kept this potential supergroup from going from ""good"" to ""great"".    Support your local library.  (And in this case, save some cash!)"
1,"Their new stuff is even worse. But this is still sexist, boring, annoying music at its worst. There are much better artists out there, so why listen to these two untalented rappers"
2,"Can this be the same D-12 that packed in witty rhymes in a non-serious demeaner? Well, I guess this really does prove they are only a side-show. Eminem has different production, so the group will have different production. Eminem went more serious, now the group is more serious.   Besides that, Shady himself (or what is left of what he use to be) is basically a no-show. In any track Eminem's in, it's usually the strongest, and that is the case here; However, that doesn't mean he was great. That means the CD itself is misconfusion, contradiction, and a side-show for Eminem's next CD (""Encore"", which was better then this, but not that great overall, as well).   D-12 is the commercials to the Eminem Show, everyone's just waiting to get in between them. That's the case here"
1,"After hearing ""I'm N Luv (Wit a Stripper)"" I don't know why anyone would want to buy and listen to this CD in its entirety. I'm not going to type a bunch of long paragraphs about why this CD sucks. This CD is a waste and T-Pain is illiterate. There! I said it in one sentence. Holllaaa"
1,"First of all FLOETIC was a brilliant album and after I heard SUPERSTAR on the radio I thought FLO'OLOGY was going to be a classic too. I was wrong. This album lacks originality, its inferior to be precise. The first time I popped this CD into the system, I found myself being friends with the skip forward button. The length of the records is despicable   This CD is not worth having....the only track that stands out for me is SUPERSTAR and I think COMMON is amazing"
1,I am at a loss to hear what people appreciate about this CD.  We were barely able to make it through one listening.  This is a classic example of a CD that NEVER would have been produced had the artist (using the term very loosely) not already been famous for something besides music.  The lack of talent and originality on this CD is apalling.  It only gets a star because that's the lowest rating.  I want my money back
2,"This is anything but soothing. The tone is too high pitched; nothing like the deep bass of crashing waves along the rocky Carmel coastline that I was hoping for. I did buy the twofer and got the Ocean Surf CD by Dan Gibson and found it much more relaxing, even though it isn't a tumbling surf sound. I was able to fall asleep... which was my goal. Now if I could only return Ocean Waves."
1,"Thankfully I checked this out of the library and did not spend money on it.  I felt the need to add a review though to spare those who might be thinking of buying it.  I made it through the CD once with my kids, but that was it.  We will not be listening again.  As others have said, go buy the Radio Disney CDs (or possibly later version of KidzBop if they come with better reviews).  The singers (kids AND adults!)on KidzBob are out of tune and just painful to listen to.   "
1,"If you like early Priest, buy Genocide. It has both Rocka Rolla and Sad Wings of Destiny in their entirety(the only thing it does NOT have is the original album artwork). Not leaving out important tracks like The Ripper, for pete's sake!!! How could you leave out The Ripper? And what about Island of Domination? I feel sorry for anyone that bought this that is unfamiliar with Priest. They got jipped and didn't even know it. These are my favorite albums by Priest and I hate to see them butchered like this... And what about the order of the songs? Why would they mess with that too? Do youself a favor and buy either Genocide, or if you like to have the original artwork, buy Rocka Rolla and Sad wings of Destiny seperately"
1,"This is the perfect example of why black women and women in general are disrespected. Lil kim is teaching generations of women to be nasty as you can be and to disrespect yourself. Then to top all of this off she is still hanging on the coat tails of biggie, the ultra fantasy gangsta rapper. Queen latifah never had to talk like this to get her name out or to make good music. This is ridiculous! Kim would be better off in a porn movie than in the rap game. Please please please spare us and stop rapping"
2,"I LOVE Destiny's Child...BUT this CD...big disappointment. The best songs on the entire CD were probably Lose My Breath,Cater 2 U and Girl...big disappointment...i just wasnt feeling the CD when i bought it.."
2,"Some reviews have suggested that this is not the ideal first purchase for the un-inititiated.  I am writing to confirm that assertion.  I have read enough raving reviews about their subsequent releases to know that it really does get better from here, but what a disappointment this album was for me.  It sounds like what you would hear coming from the garage next door.  My advice to the kids would be to keep practing and please turn it down.  Jack's appreciation of the blues is admirable, but only realised on the song ""I Fought Piranhas"".  Tellingly, this is the final song on the album.  Otherwise the songs are forgettable and even annoying at times."
1,"There are only two artists' music that I will purchase not having heard one note of the CD. Those two artists are Barbra Streisand and Linda Eder. ""Songs of Judy Garland"" was a HUGE disappointment. I was surprised at the CD cover. I don't know what ""look"" Ms. Eder was shooting for but she missed the mark. Instead of coming off as 10 years younger, she has been transformed to the point of being unrecognizable. She looks both spooky and a little like a petulant child.  Ms. Eder has always been a very attractive woman and definitely did not need this kind of ""makeover"". And the music...I tried so many times to like it. But the more I listended the more I realized I was listening to ""Liza Minnelli"" singing her mother's music. I did not hear Linda Eder. I'm begging you Ms. Eder, go back to what works. I'm sorry...this doesn't"
1,"I have to disagree with the majority of folks here who consider this cd the jazz end all. I find it grating, and darn near unlistenable. I have built a small but quality jazz library the last few months. Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck, Kenny Burrell, Grant Green, Cannonball Adderley, Stan Getz, Chet Baker, Wes Montgomery, Bill Evans and Thelonius Monk to name a few. This guy is by far my least favorite. His playing on Miles Davis cd's I have and with Monk is largely enjoyable and I know he's a giant. But this stuff?. The live recording on disc two was so grating I couldn't make it through. It sounded to me like a bunch of Geese being slaughtered. Give me the other guys anytime"
2,"I was unable to play in my car CD player, so only choice I got is to listen at home using my home DVD player."
1,"Yep, this cd sucks. That Depeche Mode guy is really random, what makes you think anyone who is looking at the punk-o-rama review would be interested in Depeche Mode? REM sucks too, Michael Stipe is the most self absorbed old bald guy ever."
2,"This album is one of the only live albums that I don't have. I have heard samples, and a few extra songs on other cds though. The first thing I hear from somebody that tell about this album is basically that Stevie couldn't have been more high. His performance was just imbarrassing for the other members in the group (specifically Reese Wynans). Most poeple don't know this but, on the old vinyl copy of this album, (I've never heard it but someone told me) there was originally a 14th track. It was the song that usually comes close to the end of Stevie's sets. The song was Life Without You. Since it was the very last song, I'm guessing Stevie was more pooped than ever beacause it was the last song and that he was extremely high and everything. Being high is one thing, but being high and playing your last song in a set is terrible. In the old vinyl disc, Stevie was on his last song and he was so terribly slow that Reese Wynans walked off stage embarrased and discusted. This track was taken off the album because of its discracefulness"
2,"Bill Charlap is undoubtedly one of the most talented, lyrcially-blessed jazz pianiasts around today.  He has a deft touch and a senisbility that far exceeds his age and life experiences.  That told, I find it very hard to give his latest effort, Stardust, more than two stars.  With very few exceptions, I found this CD to be fairly self-indulgent and Charlap rather morose in his intrepretations. It wasn't nearly a refeshing to the ear as Written in the Stars.  I would recommend this for a Charlap devotee but no one else.  He has made better albums"

2,"The restoration of a Vivaldi opera must be a commendable effort specially if filling in big voids and rebuilding major missing parts of the masterpiece. Motezuma is such an example where ample musical and artistic license was taken to bring it to life. Like restoring a canvas where not only the colors and forms had faded but also sizeable parts were ripped off and lost, reconstructing Motezuma presents the challenge for the restorer of thinking and dreaming, and becoming as inspired as Vivaldi. In listening to Motezuma, one can pick up the original Vivaldian compositions from the reconstructed material as clear as looking at a combination painting part Picasso part Michelangelo. As much as such painting can be taxing to the eye, portions of this opera can be as disappointing to the ear. Except for several arias and the two sinfonias, the music has a touch and taste of the 1800's, but not of the baroque settecento. The juxtaposition of the restorative style is also distractive, and just does not work. It makes at times the orchestration devoid of the Vivaldi unf , charm, and texture.   Nonetheless, Motezuma's musical beauty can be found in great arias such as D'ira e Furor Armato, La Figlia Lo Sposo, Gl'otraggi della Sorte, D'ove La Figlia?, S'impugni La Spada, and performances by Vito Priante, Inga Kalna, and Marijana Mijanovic. Bravo for Vito Priante and his interpretation of GI'otraggi della Sorte, and D'ove la Figlia. He does a great ornamentation in the da capos, and turns up the volume in all the right notes. Just like ""Terribile lo Sento"", and ""Orribile lo Scempio"", ""GI'otraggi"" shares the same musicalization. Somehow, this version of the score is especially more dramatic and  subtlely more melodic. "
2,"Well, unless you are a hardcore collector like myself (had it originally on vinyl all those years ago), stay clear of this album. If you want to hear noise that you & your wife/girlfriend/boyfriend could do yourself, then forget this album & make your own noise. The best track on the album is the bonus track. That tells you that this album has nothing to do with Beatles music. I give it one star for being terrible & one star for the packaging ;-).    Search Judemac Forever"" on msn"

1,"I don't see the comparison to Jeff Buckley AT ALL! That was a singer who had more talent in his little pinky than this band has on the entire album. All the songs are much too similar, the guy's voice gets boring to listen to after a while and, if you remember London Suede, has a very similar sound to them (though I will say that London Suede was MUCH better). No one has come close to the pipes of J. Buckley (or even Tim B., for that matter) in years and this doesn't count any where near that, either"
1,"i feel that a lot of bands were good in the 90's. this band was one of them. while yes, they were a bit poppy and sellout-ish on americana and conspiracy, they still had enough bad@ss in them to put on a rad song.  i think they should have just did a ""da hui"" single with ""the noose"" and maybe ""cant get my head around you"" on it. this sucks really bad. it makes the average conspiracy of one look like a bad religion album!! if you must hear, download or borrow.  please guys. quit or make good music. its pretty pathetic hearing ""hit that"" next to the godawful creed and nickelbland!!  so we go from a punk-ish hard rock band that is inspired by TSOL and The Damned and plays punk shows with pennywise to this...a corporate radio rock album that is loved by teenybopper frat boys and the mtv mindless"
2,"As a contemporary of Joan Baez (age-wise), I loved her early music and the power of her incredible voice.  I even empathize with much of her politics, but unfortunately it's time she rested on her laurels.  Her voice on this CD is quite far removed from what she was once capable of, and in fact I would have to say that there is no comparison between her vocal ability on Bowery Songs, and her earlier quality.  Like some professional athletes, she seems to not know when to quit..."
2,"I just purchased my sacd player and picked up Boston and Billy Joel's the Stranger at the same time.  After listening to the Stranger, my mouth dropped.  Billy's voice coming from the center speaker and all the other instruments and melodies coming from every different direction.  Then I put in Boston and couldn't tell a difference from the cd version I already own.  I think it's one of the best albums, but if you already own it on cd, don't bother upgrading - there's nothing special about the SACD version"

And no, we're not apparently going to have that because Britney's precious time was wasted in incorporating this bore of a song into a single and even attempting a video out of it, like we know ended up in Britney's injury.

2,Don't think Dale can play a song the same way twice. Didn't like the selection of songs nor  the  way they produced. 
1,My 8 year old daughter was very dissappointed after receiving this CD for Christmas.

It's very dissappointing that Disney doesn't tell you this on the CD

2,"Britain, circa 1997.  Tony Blair is elected P.M.  Princess Di perishes.  And the Spice Girls are unleashed to an unsuspecting public.  This effort is an attempt to cash in on the phenomenon before a fickle populace turns their attention to the next best thing.  To be fair, the girls are not to blame for what a tedious flick this is.  Rather, they are appealing and prove to be the film's lone redeeming factor.  The fault lies in the script that tries to do for the Spice Girls what ""A Hard Days' Night"" did for the Beatles.  Whereas the Fab Four's film was full of wit and cogent commentary on Beatlemania this flick is unfunny and basically incoherent about what it's trying to say about the Spice craze.  I was reminded more of the Monkees' ""Head"" than I was of ""A Hard Days' Night"".  Lots of celeb cameos (Roger Moore, Elton John, et al) that amount to naught.  Oh, well.  On to ""From Justin to Kelly"""
1,"Vote this one off the island: 19 overproduced prog-tropical instrumentals consisting entirely of primitive thumping, chanting and grunting - sort of a new age tribal orgy with pygmy porn music composed by Phil Collins. It's all supposed to convey the drama, intrigue and relevance of a TV show (Survivor Yell, Mud Bath, Chase Race, Tally the Vote, I Can See It, Buzzed) with no drama, intrigue and relevance. A desperate last ditch dig for one of the most unimportant moments in television"
1,"This disc is BAD!!! Right at the 2"" mark the sound of the ""rock water"" is join by what sounds like a slow draining bathtub. This sound is more or less present throughout the entire hour. Other discs of this type that I've heard don't do this"
2,NOTHING NEW HERE.  I like reading the ridiculous reviews of these cds where people gush all over the screens over how much they love Patton.  This cd is dull.  Suffering from Patton overexposure.  Maybe he should actually spend some time and make an awesome album (Like Secret Chiefs 3 - Book of Horizons)  rather than dozens of merely adequate ones
2,"When I played the first composition on this CD, I started thinking that  perhaps I had purchased a really stellar CD because the first song was  really jumping. But after that, this CD is disapointing to me. There are  maybe three pretty good compositions with the rest being totally  unmemorable. With the three good cuts from this disc and a few from her  first CD, Joyce Cooling could have made one good CD. But, in my opinion,  there aren't enough good songs here to warrant a release of this CD. Joyce  certainly has potential, but she needs to work on her creativity. She sound  here like an artist still maturing in style"
1,"on the liner notes to one of the two blues albums (i think it is shaker) it is said that the original idea was just to perform some of these songs in a one night concert. that should have been as far as it went.  to foist these songs on an unsuspecting public at 19 bucks a crack is highway robbery.  if these are blues songs, then i am robert johnson's illegitimate son. ""death letter"" is good, maybe even great, but cannot compare to the original or to any of the covers i have previously heard.  the rest is a waste of time.  the cover art is excellent but hardly the reason you would be expected to buy the cd.  these are my first 2 reviews by the way, but all these 5-star reviews for both cd's finally got me motivated.  go buy a muddy waters or lightning hopkins cd and save 10 bucks in the bargain"
2,"There are only a couple of songs I did like on this cd. I did enjoy Ice Cube and Aaliyah, but the rest of the cd left me cold. I do think that if you can just find the two songs and pay to download them, it would have been better! I suggest borrowing first from a friend and seeing if you actually like it first before you buy."
2,"i like a little bit of it, doesent mean its good, i wont throw it away or anything, ill just let it sift...wait...and look at the album cover most of the time. slayer is getting better though"
1,"The worst Christmas album I ever heard.  I just bought it, played it once, and will NEVER play it again"
1,"I can't believe none of the other reviews of the Ultra Lounge series state that these CD's contain almost all instrumental music, with very few songs that feature vocals.  I expect a lounge music CD to have a mix of both vocal and instrumental tracks, and of the four Ultra Lounge CD's I purchased, I count only three songs with vocals on all four of them.  While the instrumental songs do fit the genre of lounge music, they tend to blend into one another and become mundane after hearing several of them.  The titles of the Ultra Lounge CD's (such as Bachelor Pad or Bossanova) mean very little, as each CD fails to distinguish itself from any other because of all of the instrumental tracks.  The best lounge CD I have heard so far is from an unlikely source.  I purchased it at Pottery Barn, and it has a great mix of vocal and instrumental songs.  Keep this in mind when buying lounge music CD's so that you won't be disappointed the way I was with the Ultra Lounge series"
1,Buddy Holly has a number of collections that are superior to the one put out under the 20th Century Masters series.  Every one of the CDs in this series is skimpy in content and superfluous.  This one is no exception.   Look elsewhere
1,"This CD had the makings of a great recording. The problem was telling Popper where they were performing!Butch,please record another one but leave Popper at home.He's full of a lot of things,but TALENT isn't one of them"
1,"I like most of AC/DC's music, but I can't stand their latest album Stiff Upper Lip.  Stiff Upper Lip is the only AC/DC album where you can play it all the way through, and not even hear one good song.  Stiff Upper Lip doesn't even come close to being as good as Back in Black or Highway to Hell.  Every song on it just bugs the heck out of me.  Listening to one song off this album is enough to test my patience; but enduring all 12 of these musical abominations is enough to drive me crazy!  The overall sound is very similar to their earlier albums like Highway to Hell or Back in Black.  BUT...those CDs had variety, they were semi original, and they were actually pretty good.  THIS CD is just completely worthless.  I have heard some cra ppy CDs in my lifetime, but none of them were more pain to listen to than this.  The vocalist sounds about 10 times worse than he did on their earlier albums, the music is chunky, repetitive, dull, and boring, and most of the songs sound the same. Stiff Upper Lip is so bland and dull sounding that it sounds more like the monotonous droning of an electric fan than a rock n roll band.  The music is so repetitive and similar sounding that its more like listening to the same annoying song for 60 minutes than 12 separate tracks.  This CD is just unbelievaby terrible.  It is a disgrace to this band's legacy, and the band members should be embarrased by it.  Oh well, I guess they probably only made this album because they needed to fulfill their record contract, so I guess they don't care about how awful it is anyway.  All I can tell you potential buyers is to stay as far away from this piece of garbage as possible.  It is a TOTAL piece of cr ap and it is not fit to listen to.  Go buy a GOOD AC/DC CD like Let there Be Rock, High Voltage, Powerage, Highway to Hell, or Back in Black.  Stiff Upper Lip suc ks so hard it leaves a big purple bruise.  It's so awful I'd rather listen to the new Nickelback CD than this!"
1,"To those of you interested in this CD in lieu of finding the &quot;songs with lyrics&quot; in the movie ICE AGE, got bad news for you. They are NOT here!  I really do hate it when a soundtrack is put out for a movie and they don't include the best or features songs in the movie.  Anyway, the song that pretty much everyone wants when Manny, Sid, Diego and the baby are together and walking towards Half Peak is called &quot;Send Me On My Way&quot; by Rusted Root. It is on their latest album &quot;When I Woke&quot;. Put Rusted Root in the Amazon search engine and you should find it.  Hope this helps those looking for this song"
2,"Anna Netrebko's I Puritani selections are way below the art and skill of Callas, Sills, Sutherland, Caballe, and Gencer. She has no passion, no trills, no high notes that are deep and rich. Her best is in the Russian repertoire and possibley some undemanding Mozart.   Her broadcast from the Met Live of the I Puritani was alright, but scooping, avoidance of repetitions, running through passages like a locomotive, and an ending that would have brought the wrath of most opera houses in the world..scooping again, and a tight awful sounding high note. The same tentativenes is also here on this CD.She should know this. Her beauty and acting and allure are what interest the masses, not the voice, which is forgiven everything.  Too bad; she could be a lovely Tatyana some day.Also too, the Traviata is not that great; Anna Moffo , Renee Fleming, M. Caballe, and of course Maria Callas..Listen to these and hear the difference"
1,Yo Nu-Mixx sux i hate when people make cd's like this to make some money off of great artist like Pac. This cd is disrespecting Pac and nobody should get this if your a Pac fan. They take great songs and make crappy beats. Get this if you want to support Pac haters or waste your money
1,"I'm going to the trouble of writing this review to warn you: this cd is not like the other Putumayo cds. No, it is not fun, hip, relaxing, good to dance to, or stimulating. It is a selection of hackneyed Sinatra-style slop sung by a variety of leery-sounding men with fake deep voices. I have this rule for music: if it makes me think of animated dogs kissing over pasta, it sucks. Consider yourself warned. If you like good music, try French Cafe instead"
1,"This is humor? When does the humor begin? Is it close to the end cause I reckon that this ain't funny. Maybe the fans of this guy can go home and beat there spouses with banjos and leave the rest of us alone, I reckin"
1,"This Air Supply should've been cut off a very long time ago.  Whenever any of their songs comes on the radio I immediately shut it off.  Bad ear candy is all they ever recorded.  Mindless, sappy garbage.  Even Bread's music  was more interesting than this"
1,"This cd its just horrible, they sold only 10,000 copies enough to pay for their instruments lol ! There are better bands than this an example is bleeding through so i think no one cares about a re release peace out"
2,"At no point in my following review am I by any means intentionally downing Hank Jr. I am just trying to give an honest review of this cd.  At the time this album was realeased, Hank Jr. was riding high, winning big at the CMA's and ACM's.  He was also releasing some of the most critically aclaimed country records of his recording career.  But then for some reason he decided he needed to record some rock and roll.  To me this cd is a studio recorded version of a Hank Williams Jr. live concert.  The only difference is he didn't botch the vocals as he does on his live show.  The music is decidedly 80% not country, it drifts towards eighties rock.    If you trace Hank Jr.'s recording career, you can point at this cd at the one that started the downward spiral that he has only began to pull himself out of.    I must say though, this cd contains one of Hanks last top 10 hits, ""If the South Woulda Won,"" which is an hard to find recording on his compilations.  I'd say this cd is kinda essential collecion wise, just because of that song. "
2,"I wanted to give this CD as a gift to my 7 year old niece who loves the movie.  I listened to it first to make sure the quality was good. I was so surprised when all I heard was music and no words.  Although the music is nice, I know she would not be too impressed. We had seen the movie together and we loved Mr. Ray's song and wanted to know the words.  It's too bad that I'll have to return or sell it"
1,This never should've been pressed.  They should've taken the mix and thrown it out.  DO NOT BUY!!
2,"The singing is terrible on ""Fly Me To The Moon"".  Don't take my word for it.  Listen to the free sample supplied by Amazon.com .  At 16 seconds into it, when she sings ""all I worship and adore"", she goes almost a whole note sharp for several notes!  Even someone with no musical training can hear it.  The rest of the pieces sound fine"
5,"I just want to put it out there...Audra McDonald is an absolute genious. Everything she touches turns to gold, and I just want to smack some of you for saying that she failed in her attempt to make a great record. This may not be the audra that we are used to, but if you listen closely she's near by. So this CD is a little less difficult vocally. So what? My favorite quality of Ms. McDonald's is that she is emotionally connected to whatever she is singing. She could record twinkle twinkle little star and I would want to listen to it over and over again because she tells a story. So if you buy this CD, listen to it more than once. Let it grow on you. Let Audra do her thang children. Let her do her thang."
5,if you do not own this album you must get your hand on a copy. It is the best debut album since definatly mayby. Tracks like &quot;golden touch&quot; &quot;V.I.C.E&quot; well lets just say every song on the album is a bonnifide hit including the banging&quot;stumbble and fall&quot; which will have you tapping your toes from the first 2 seconds. If you like the libretines or the others or are just looking for a solid cd this is a must have
5,"I won't say to everybody this greatest hits is highly recommended. Being that I never heard all of her albums, so a true fan may feel like some songs is missin'. However for me, who is just really startin to seriously get into pop is somewhat satisfied with these and this is a 5 star collection to me. Some of the tracks I love, a couple I don't like at all and the rest I just like. My favorite ones are in order; Erotica Ray of Light Beautiful Stranger The power of goodbye Deeper and Deeper The prodution is excellent and I love the vocals. If your new to Madonna, my opinion would be to start here. But a true fan can give me lessons."
4,"As one of the founding fathers of today's heavy metal rock music, Iron Butterfly has them power, drive, and sound that made them unique in the world of rock music. This live album serves as a testament to that fact. Eventhough the recordings of live concerts from the late 1960's through the mid 1980's was primative at best (by today's standards), this live recording of Iron Butterfly captures most of the groups best music durring their prime as a chart-topping group of that era. This is a ""must-have"" for all Iron Butterfly fans"
5,"I bought this CD before going to see MMW (with John Scofield) for the first time at First Avenue in Minneapolis Dec 7, 2006.  I had never heard of them before and liked the clip on the venue's website.  So I bought a ticket and wanted to get ""Out Louder"", which I knew they were going to play, to familiarize myself, but the store I was at was out of it.  So I bought ""End of the World"" instead.  While some of it was a little too spacey for my liking at first, I still liked the overall funkiness of it all.    THEN....I saw them PLAY.  You MUST see them PLAY!!  I didn't ever want it to end! I immediately wanted to see them again!  It's less than a week later and I have 2 more CD's (""Out Louder"" and Scofield's ""A-Go-Go"" which they ""back"" him on) and 4 more on the way from amazon as I'm writing this.  I'm like an ADDICT now!  I HAVE to have them on in the car and in the house.  I get back in the car after having been in a store or whatever and they're on and all is right with my world again.    I must say I like ""Out Louder"" and even ""A-Go-Go"" better than ""End of the World"", but only slightly.  It IS trippy with the synth and the other guest players, and I do like it better after a few listens.  I just prefer MMW with less guest musicians"
1,"While I have no doubt of Sting's genuine admiration and love for Dowland's music, the performances here simply will not do. He has obviously learned the notes very carefully, and he does make it through each of these challenging songs...but just barely.  Never do any of these performances really take off and soar and become true interpretations.  The entire enterprise remains firmly earthbound and doggedly ""note-for-note"" in its approach.  To be fair, subtlety and nuance never have a chance with the all-too-close ""pop"" miking of Sting's voice, which makes it sound like he and the excellent lutenist Edin Karamazov weren't even in the same room when performing. Moreover, Sting's proclivity for nasal vocal production and oddly colored vowels tend to render the highly poetic texts almost unintelligible.  Add to this Sting's hokey ""Masterpiece Theatre""-style readings from a letter of John Dowland to Sir Robert Cecil, chief adviser to Elizabeth I, and some ill-advised multitracking effects, and the whole experience quickly becomes unlistenable.  In which case, I won't carp about the disc's rather meager running time of 48 minutes, since even at that short measure, it seems much longer.  I'm just glad I didn't shell out for the disc; I borrowed it from my local lending library, and it goes back at the end of the week"
4,"I'm going to avoid focusing on the politics involved here and focus on the music. go to the moveon.org and musicforamerica.com sites and judge for yourself whether they're causes worth giving money to. If so, read on, if not, browse for something else.   Though primarily focused on ""indie"" acts, this album is still pretty diverse, which can be both a good and bad thing (whose idea was it to follow up a typically jazz-pop-rap track by Will.i.am from the Black-eyed Peas with They Might Be Giants' cover of William Henry Harrison's 1840's campaign song?). Highlights include the aforementioned TMBG song, OKGO's surprisingly subtle cover of The Zombies ""This Will Be Our Year"", former Soul Coughing vocalist Mike Doughty's ""Move On"",  Laura Cantrell's haunting rendition of country classic ""Sam Stone"", and the late Elliott Smith's ""A Distorted Reality..."", soon to be available on his posthumous album From The Basement On The Hill. The problem lies in too many live/alternate versions of things; the ""acoustic"" rendition of Fountains Of Wayne's ""Everything's Ruined"" improves on the far too muted original from their debut album, but the Blink 182 remix is barely different from the original (which isn't a good song to begin with), the Bright Eyes live track is gratingly drawn out, and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs live version of ""Date With The Night"" is too murky to really capture their manic live shows. As a compilation, this album has a few flaws, and is a bit overstuffed with alternate versions and live material, but overall it's got enough good material to warrant purchase if you like at least a handful of the bands involved, and again, you believe in the cause."
4,"It's no box set and therefore (inevitably) excludes some tunes I wouldn't have, but this is a good sampler of Tom Scott's 70s &quot;heydays,&quot; including the crank-it-up &quot;Gotcha&quot; (Starsky &amp; Hutch TV theme song) and soulful &quot;Shadows,&quot; among others.  I was disappointed more from &quot;Blow It Out&quot; wasn't included, but overall it's a good (not great) single album's worth of Tom Scott.  If you like 70s fusion (for lack of a better term), you should like this.  Certainly worth $.."
1,"I've been listening to Frank Sinatra for years, and this kind of stuff just leaves me cold - I'd rather here the man himself...  Or, for a completely different take on the material, someone with a completely original approach like Shamus Dark, and his album ""Songs For Suicidal Lovers"", which sounds like nothing I've heard before, whilst staying true to the fantastic songs. As www.evolutionofmedia.com said: ""...aural film noir...delve into the dark side..."
5,"Prince's 1981 album CONTROVERSY is another classic album in his catalog. The title track is the standout immediately. This longer version than the single version features a prayer. The song is funky and effective. ""Sexuality"" is a great disco/funk number. ""Do Me, Baby"" is probably one of the sexiest songs he's ever done. This full length version is the one to hear. ""Private Joy"" is another funky song which is another favorite on the album. ""Ronnie, Talk To Russia"" is a short protest kind of song. Same goes for ""Annie Christian"", which he wrote about the shooting of John Lennon, Ronald Reagan, various Atlanta child murders. Not as effective as ""Ronnie, Talk To Russia"" but a decent track nonetheless. Overall a highlight in Prince's career"
1,"I bought this CD because it got a lot of good reviews, and the description sounded like something I would enjoy. However, it turned out to be an atrocious CD. It is very repetitive and monotonous throughout. The songs pretty much all sound the same. There's little melodic variation, and the vocals have basically no range. The lyrics are extremely uninspired. I'm glad I bought this used at a cheap price. I don't know if I'm going to give it away or just throw it away; it's that bad."
2,"I purchased this cd expecting a solid group of songs from JMM.  However, this album really lacks when it comes to good material. There really isn't one song that stands out, nothing worth playing over and over.  The entire album is pretty much ""blowing flowers out of your [rear end]"" types of songs. The title cut, ""Pictures"" is about a guy that likes to take pictures of his family and looks forward to taking more.  It sounds like something an 8 year old wrote.  Rather than wasting 15 bucks on this cd, get a Pat Green or Brad Paisley cd, they are much more worth your money"
4,"I have been ""making"" my kids listen to the music of TMBG for years, but I no longer have to ""make"" them listen.  My 6 and 7-year-olds actually ""want"" to listen to songs like ""No!,"" ""Clap Your Hands,"" and ""Four of Two.""  Although this is not TMBG's best CD (some say it is ""Flood""), this is my kid's favorite TMBG's CD"
5,"This CD will really grow on you. So listen to it several times before you make your final judgement. It is one of Van Morrison's best.  This CD appears to be almost Autobiographical at times. Especially STRANDED...JUST LIKE GRETA...THEY SOLD ME OUT. His Jazz background, his Irish background, his Blues  background...are all present on this CD."
2,"i usually dont add my two cents to highly reviewed music but in this fickle world you are only as good as your last album,and since we usually have to wait half a decade for you to spit out another this makes it worse. Ive seen Sade often in concerts and she has always had a great sound. this album is more pop. If it ain't broke don't fix it"
1,"Remember the days when we were punks and we'd gather 'round the phonograph and listen to some Puccini on the old Edison cylinders? They held up to 4 minutes of music! Count 'em, 4 minutes! Then that hippie opera singer Enrico Caruso came along and all the young punks would listen to him, including myself. He was quite the singer. When I was a young kid though, the only form of music we had were the concerts. I remember seeing Franz Liszt play the piano in concert, quite an amazing virtuoso, and Johann Strauss Jr. conducting his orchestra, those were the days.   Then they came out with those things called grammophones, which were even more modern, if it was even possible. But it was, because then they came out with a new modified version of the phonograph that all the young punks would listen to, lazy kids. I mean, you didn't even have to crank a handle like you had to with grammophones. And what's this, 1 hour, a full 60 minutes of music, on 1 record? Pshaw! 4 minutes of music was all I needed, and I was still pooped out even after that. In my day, it was bed at 4 p.m., breakfast at 2 a.m., then off to the mines. We didn't have 60 minutes of free time.   I have no idea what form of music they have now. Appearently, they came out with a couple other things after the phonograph. Now all I see these days are kids with their fancy eye-pods (?) and MP3, MP4 players, whatever they're called, listening to that ""hip-hop"" tomfoolery of theirs. You can't even call it music, it's just noise. Well, gotta get ready for bed now, it's almost 3:45"
4,"Tabitha, Athena, and Lavonn, I'll leave all of my women for you three.  Let's talk music, Surrender, I Like, Keep On, Giving You My Love Again, and the songs with Keith Sweat sound great.  These ladies were in the range of groups like SWV and Jade.  That's a good class to be in. "
1,"wow...i look at this track listing and it makes me cringe....i mean i know that warped lost its punk credibility back in 2003, but this is just overkill....relient k, academy is, everytime i die, from first to last, underoath, matchbook romance, saves the day are reasons not to support this tour(for all those people who go just to see NOFX, Casualties, and Time Again)...i REALLY give bad religion and rancid props for not being on here this time around! this is worse than last year's by far....but what could you expect? these tours over the past 3 years have been on a downfall...i mean the bands that are good on this aren't really worth the agony and disgust to want to purchase this and/or purchase a 40$ ticket to one of the shows. to me, that is a scam...im so glad that people stopped referring to warped tour as a ""punk"" tour...i mean maybe if NOFX gets a hefty amount of boos from those trendy scenester hot topic kids, then maybe even those guys can see what hell this ""nu-emo"" trend is.  now, i am not going to go off on some explosion about what real punk is, but i will say this....fans of warped 2003 and back...steer clear..this is merely a compilation of green day-esque bands(minus Time Again and Casualties..and maybe 3-5 other decnet bands)....some are turned up a few thousand jolts and some are slowed down a little bit, but i bet any of them will admit that bille joe(brainless) armstrong is a deep inspiring figure.  all we are really missing here to make this the ultimae pile of crap is fallout boy, simple plan, yellowcard, blink 182, good charlotte and new-school afi.  bottom line...avoid like the plague and maybe it will change next year for the better!......most likely it'll be worse, but hey, stranger things have happened"
2,"i gotta say I used to love this album back in the late 70's . just purchased again thru amazon here and it really isn't as good as I remembered . . .they are quite loose, the songs don't stand the test of time, the playing not nearly as great as I remember it to be. . . surprisingly rough on groove. . . . not a true classic - i thought it wa"
1,"""With 22 tracks sprawling over 74 arse-numbing minutes, Cripple Crow is hopelessly self-indulgent. It's a pity, because on the few occasions when Banhart applies the quality control - as on the short but pretty 'Dragonflies' - he shows flashes of McCartney-esque melodic craft. Generally, though, Banhart is happiest when he's wasting an hour and a quarter of your valuable time with his witless meandering and irritating stoner-drawl. ""  ""Already this year we have heard the awesome Amadou & Mariam record on which producer Manu Chao brilliantly fuses western pop sensibilities with ethnic sounds to create fresh and invigorating music. In comparison, Banhart's feeble grasp of world/folk music comes across as a shoddy, flashy sweatshop counterfeit.""  It's probably this month's top-seller in Tower Records of Goa, however"
5,"I dont know what the fuss is wether the fans will be accepting to The Killers new sound and look, I for one love it! By the 3rd time i heard the album, i knew there was no way i'd be able to stop listening to it for a very long time, just like Hot Fuss. The songs are great, the hooks are awesome and its so polished to perfection."
1,"I purchased this CD and I was ripped off. The sounds on the CD are pathetic. They are of poor quality, with one person standing in a sound booth. I could have made a better recording with my tape recorder and mic myself. I was looking for a CD to compile a string of sounds for my Haunted house. Now I have to find another means of getting these sounds. DON'T BUY THIS CD. You will not get your moneys worth"
1,"Well what the hell to expect from a big cynical misanthrope such as myself?  Flowery bubbly warm rays of sunshine?  HELL NO!  You see folks it's people like Lil Jon that make me think in such a morbid manner.  When I see Special Ed. failures who look and act like mental house rejects make lots of money I tend to get a little pessimistic.  BUT CAN YOU BLAME ME?  Seriously, let's screw our heads on tightly and think about this for a second, why would a sane person actually listen to let alone actually purchase this cd?  This is a complete joke.  I'm simply calling it like I see it.  Lil Jon deserves no respect from any human being, not even his crack head of a mother.    Actually you might as well compare Lil Jon to Elmo, Elmo being a puppet has a MILLION times more skill at what he does.  At least Elmo is a good and wholesome children's icon that kids can have fun with.  If I ever have a kid someday Elmo will still be a hit with the kids but Lil Jon will still be laughed at once all his ""fans"" grow up and realize how stupid they were to actually buy into his garbage he pans off as ""music"".  Meh, well who I am kidding this review (like my last 6) probably won't even get posted anyway. "
1,My alarm clock is set at 3:40. Superhero underwear is cool. CD Drives blink. I got a concussion from the fire alarm. Puppies will conquer the world. Wonder Woman Would beat up Superman. U r the coolest person in the world. Thank you for looking at this useless revie
4,"OK I can't myself here, but this guy really listened to a lot Supertramp growing up or something.  I liked to album, but I can hear hints of Supertramp's style in about half the songs here in different degrees.  ""Bad Day"" probably the most notable of the bunch really sounds like something that came of the ""Breakfast in America"" album to me.  Still the album is enjoyable though, especially if you did like Supertramp.  I get the Leo Sayer hook, but I think it's off a bit.  Leo never used that many keyboards"
1,i would review it if i got it. come on guys. i placed the order on 1/6/06.
1,The songs just did not get me dancing.  I have to say I was disappointed.  But I love Kids Favorite Songs VOl 2 but was never able to buy it as it was not availabl
1,I was listening to water boil this morning. I preferred it to this album
1,"Is it true that the lead singer for Hinder only records while he is on the toilet constipated? His voice sounds so. The way he sings ""Lips of an Angel"" makes me want to punch him in the face! I'd rather pick dried semen out of my pubic hair over listening to this group. I seriously almost tripped and fell at work trying to get to the radio and change the station before I heard the chorus! "
5,"This music so so wonderful.  It is very high energy and fun.  The kids don't really care that this a ""jazz"" album- what they do know is that they love the music and it makes them feel happy.  Don't waste your money and insult your kids intelligence and your ears with the what sells as ""kids"" music, get them something you can both enjoy.  Our favorites are the ""Doodle"" song and ""Potato Chips.""  Worth every penny and then some"
5,This is one of the best kid CDs I've heard.  The songs are all catchy and fun to listen to.  It's a great intro to jazz
5,"This was They Might Be Giants first major label album.  It continued, and expanded upon, the sound they had established on their independant label albums.  It's probably TMBG's most popular album.  It features many classic TMBG songs, like ""Birdhouse in Your Soul"", ""Istanbul"" and ""Particle Man"".  It's chock full of the catchy melodies and silly lyrics that we have come to expect from the Johns.  A must have for all They Might Be Giants fans"
5,Our 22 mo. old loves this music much more than the kiddy tunes that mom and dad can hardly bear to listen to.
5,"Hot Hot Heat's Make up the Breakdown is a follow-up of Knock Knock Knock. Personally, if you're a big Hot Hot Heat fan, this will be one of your most favorite albums. Each and every song is unique and has catchy beats that will make you want to dance. The first song Naked in the City Again is great.  The second song, No, Not Now, is a popular tune that you can't help but start movin'. Get in or Get out has some of the most rad keyboarding parts. Bandages, one of the biggest hits on the album is sort of what boosted Hot Hot Heat's career and just this one song will make the album worth purchasing. Oh Goddamnit is such an amazing song, with very fun lyrics so you're bound to sing along. The next song Aveda keeps many of us wondering: Ex-Girlfriend or Hair Product? Either way you'll like you'll still enjoy this song. This Town, many believe was written about some crazy fans, you listen and decide for yourself. Talk to Me, Dance with Me was also a very big hit that got fans into Hot Hot Heat. This song makes me dance, sing, and every other thing you can do to your favorite song. On Save us S.O.S. you will love how deep the lead singer, Steve Bays' voice sounds, your heart will melt. Although very different from Hot Hot Heat's normal songs, In Cairo, is also a great song and adds a fabulous ending to Make up the Breakdown. This cd will be in your stereo for hours on end. The songs are addicting so this album is definately worth it's money. "
5,"Wonderful harmony, great voices, beautiful music.  This group deserves to be better known and to be hugely successful"
1,"The first time I heard about Antony and the Johnsons was from a friend of mine that told me about Rufus Wainwright and was listening to a new artist that was quite incredible.  I decided to do some investigating about this Antony at a local Barnes & Noble and what I discovered was very, very dissapointing.  I find the music to be well written instrumentally and layered quite well, but Antony's voice is very over the top and fake.  By fake, I mean his use of vibrato, which is very rapid and used in a way that comes out as forced and sheeplike (not natural).  Professional voice instructors teach that the correct way to use vibrato is at the right speed: five to six vibrations per second.  It is evident that Antony's ""trained"" sounding voice is not trained at all in this realm.  Another thing about this band and record that I find very horrible is the lyrics to the songs.  The artist seems confused or regretful of his own gender using a sorrowful and painful delivery of these wailings.  The lyrics hold no attraction or relation to the listening, which lends the listener to a pitiful and almost annoying view of the music itself because of this.  My conclusion is that this is a terrible record and the singer needs to pursue professional voice lessons... and help"
5,"St. Elsewhere combines the energy of club beats with the soulful [and at times wistful] voice of Cee-Low and thought-provoking lyrics. I enjoy the variety of styles [from the frentic ""Go-Go Gospel"" to the introspective ""Just a Thought""]. A must-have purchase"
2,"the music can be explained and defined pretty much as the title itself just think of ""classic"". I assumed the music was going to be very club material that has a history of songs being played after the years by clubs.. a large portion of the cd i cannot see it as a gothic ""club"" material esspecially throwing in some type-o.. i been through alot of clubs and i cannot find a way to hit that song in the dance floor.. if not i guess i have been in the wrong places.. it looks to me they ran out of ideas and threw in some mainstream that everyone listens to so they would  i was very dissapointed in the whole cd. listened to a few songs here and there, if you are into the old stuff then this is the stuff for you.. i really dont recomend this cd to any collection besides you want to be blasted in the past."
4,"Having left my Gothic Club mix CD at home, I decided to buy this one. What hooked me first was the live recording of ""Bela Lugosi's Dead"" by Bauhaus, which is classic Goth music. Some of the bands I liked, some I didn't, but all in all this is a great CD. My favorite is ""Sheryl"" on the second CD. This is a great CD for chilling, dancing, or showing the uneducated masses what Goth music really is"
2,"Tony Yayo's ""Thoughts of a Predicate Felon"" suffers from the fact that Tony Yayo simply doesn't know who he is (or who he is supposed to be) on this album. Before I listened to this album, I expected to hear gritty, descriptive rhymes about Yayo's criminal life. Unfortunately however, I, like many of you, tuned into tracks such as ""Tattle Teller,"" ""Curious,"" and ""Project Princess."" For an ex-convict, that is not the type of message you want to project to an audience that is expecting something more... hardcore; something better. On tracks such as ""Live By The Gun"" and ""Homicide,"" Yayo delivers my aforementioned desire for ""harder"" lyrics, but tracks such as these are few and far between. Hopefully Tony Yayo can focus on doing this for his next album but for now, this debut album is simply a dissapointment"
1,"I think this album is boring. I think it doesnt do its job. I think Lil Jon is a wannabe. I think they needs to get a real job. I think this broke very soon after i got it. I think this won't play in most cd players. i think the cover looks stupid. i think it gave me the idea to scream YEAH! and WHAT! at my brothers wake. i think art is stupid. I think i don't recommend this. I think ive said enough. I think im going to hell now. I think i was anyway, cause i think i sold my soul"
4,"This album is a masterpiece by a legend who, at 65 years old, topped the charts. Dylan is an extroadinary talent and seems to get even better with age. Every song is exceptional and showcases his great talent and songwriting ability"
5,"I first heard this song last summer while I was painting our house. Out in the fresh air and the sun (and recently wed), this song immediately caught my attention and only seemed to get more irrestible with every listen. While it's what I guess I would call somewhat of a ""rock"" song (during the chorus),  it's Alex Band's vocals that conveys the longing, passionate love element of the song. He manages to keep it romantic and unique instead of just making it a another decent rock song. I've also heard Chad's version from the album; while Chad's vocals are actually not *that* much different from Alex's (both manage to be very masculine and strong), I feel that the version with Chad is a ""good"" song while Alex's delivery makes it a ""great"" song. While Chad's voice is great for other songs, for this type of song it is overly domineering and angry-sounding. From a woman's perspective, Alex's way would manage to convince me to ""get together"" while Chad's would scare me off! Sometimes, one vocalist is just ""meant"" to sing a song and either make it or break it. Think of ""Smooth"" from 1999. Rob Thomas' delivery helped to make that song the hit it was. In this case, Alex is the perfect man for the job."
5,"An outstanding set of kid's music with folk scene stalwarts such as Arlo Guthrie, Taj Mahal and Tim O'Brien joined by bluegrassers Tim O'Brien and Rhonda Vincent and blues pickers Keb Mo, Guy Davis and Eric Bibb, as well as Americana-country types such as Rosie Flores... An impressive lineup, sure, but better still is the calibre of songwriting, and the actual kid friendliness of it all.  This is a really fun album!  Fun, as in, little kids might actually like it, and might even sing along if you played it for them.  Plenty of silly songs like ""Bling-Blang,"" ""Bananaphone"" and ""Bellybutton Song.""  Some songs are perky, like ""Red, Red Robin""; others are instructive, like ""Man Named All The Animals,"" and others still model assertiveness and communication skills, like Taj Mahal's excellent ""Don't You Push Me Down,"" in which various kids stick up for themselves in unpleasant situations.  I like this album a lot, and plan to play it for my kid for years to come"
5,"You are great on this one Danielle, I love and miss you so much. I wish it was 1982 and you were still on Archie Bunkers Place. You poor thing, I'll be your main reviewer from now on. Why are you hiding that great voice and acting talent in New York. I would love to put you to work for Mirror Vision Inc. Records in Morro Bay CA. I plan to see you in concert soon and hope you are having a good fall. I think of you often and always mention your bright star to other people, I wish I could think of you more, you have never met me, and I know we have become distant, but you are still the mystery of my life, say hello to your dad and mom for me, and I miss you from Morro Bay CAlifornia,(i love you babe) love garr"
5,"In 1975, Joe Jackson was tired of Motown Records controlling his childrens' careers. So he moved them over to Epic Records. The newly Christened ""Jacksons"" had to prove themselves to not only CBS Records, but to the world that they could produce, write, and perform their own records with plausible credibility.So instead of being controlled by Henry Cosby, Hal Davis, and to a lesser extent, Berry Gordy at Motown, their direction was handed over by Epic to Philidelphia Phunk-Meisters Kenneth Gamble, and Leon Huff. They had a tremendous string of success, with Teddy Pendergrass, MFSB, Harold Melvin, and The Blue Notes, and McFadden and Whitehead to name just a few.  They took the Jacksons' original songs, brought them into the studio, worked their Philly majik, and out came one of the greatest Soul records ever cut on wax. From Start to finish, ""The Jacksons"" takes you from one Phunkified Phunk Phest top the next, starting with ""Enjoy Yourself"" and Culminating in the Phunkadelic ""Style Of Life"". When I was a child I heard this record, and originally thought that ""Good Times"" was the Jackson's remake of the theme from that TV show. But it was pure slow Phunk. Phunk-da-fied-, Phunkalicious, or just just plain Phantastic, The Jackson's Epic Debut is Phat"
5,"I am 68 and a long time Stewart fan, this is one of his best.  Don't know what the problem is with the other reviewers"
5,"What would have happened if Ian Curtis had not pulled the plug on his own life?  It is a hard question to ask since I am a very devoted Joy Division Fan but I also am a good fan of New Order.  I have to say that I imagine Joy Division might have recorded one ore two more albums  and broken up: New Order may have never been.  So while it is tragic that Curtis committed suicide it gave the way for the rest of Joy Division the license to effectively reinvent themselves as New Order.  The band is very Different from JD but in ""Power, Corruption Lies"" , New Order's first, we hear a hint of JD with a burst of new creativity that must have been the results of a painful and cathartic period.    The music on this album is more heavily Synth and Drum based than any of the JD material though maybe not as much as later New Order work.  By 1983 synths and drum machines were just coming into their own and this year saw the invention of the MIDI interface for synths etc. It was also a time when the new wave movement was finally getting solidified.  All history aside, the album is great: it is upbeat, full of poppy dance tracks and a real new wave classic.  If you are buying the album just for ""Blue Monday"" (a track so good even a horrible band like Orgy could make a hit out of it) you are in for a real surprise. You will find many of the other tracks to be great as well.  ""Age of Consent"" is among my other favorites.  This is another great track for dancing.  Also ""the Village""  is a great track as well.  If you are going to buy two New Order albums get this one and Substance.  Although they share a few tracks they are both great.  I find that this album get far more play though.  This is a must have for the New Order fan of course.  But also fans of new wave/'80's music and Joy Division fans alike should also buy this one.  This album has received so much acclaim and has been so influential in its 20-year life span that it should be a must have for any modern music fan.  I highly recommend it!  -- Ted Murena   "
5,This CD is great for the entire family. The songs are catchy and it's not a big deal if you're caught singing them around strangers!
2,"I really couldn't wait to get this CD.  I wanted so badly to like it.  But - it is just too bluegrassy for me.  Every single song.  It would be great one or two songs, but every song gets old.  Plus, the recording quality doesn't seem that great.  You can barely hear the words, and most kids want to sing along.  Jenny Jenkins is a fun song, and Shenendoah is hauntingly beautiful, but For the Kids and NO! are way better CD's"
5,"I enjoy the album still to this day. All the songs are good, but I listen a couple of songs more than others such as Hold On, You don't have to worry, Don't Go.  This is a great album, which I don't planning on selling or trading anytime soon. "
5,The Crusaders Sound Great on this Disc.The Music&amp;Arrangements work very well all the way thru.The Grooves&amp;Smoothness make this Recording very Complete.this Group has been Bad for so long
5,"If it has the name Edwin McCain on it, trust me its a great product to buy. The songs he writes are heart felt and true to every drop of ink used to write them with.."
1,"Following on from the fantastic 'The Duel' Allison Moorer's latest release 'Getting Somewhere' is a massive, massive  disappointment. Quite simply the material on 'Getting Somewhere' is weak and gutless.  On the rare occasions Moorer tries to emulate the beauty and feel of 'The Duel' - such as on Hallelujah & New Years Day - Earle rips the heart out of the material with such an amateurish, pedestrian and thin production that you feel cheated ! Business and pleasure rarely mix and Moorer should take a long, hard look at this release and give serious consideration to re-installing RS Field next time around.  If Moorer wants a guitar groove that burns , drums that drive and vocals that mesmerise then Earle is simply not the man for the job.  Moorer is a fantastic talent who has one of the finest female voices of any genre (she can write a mean song too ! ) . This CD showcases none of her abilities and should be consigned to the bargain bins immediately"
1,"I get the feeling that most of the reviews on here for this album are written by folks who feel special because they think they discovered some new amazing genre and sound that no one else knows about.  Hate to break it to you kids, but this sounds has been around since the mid 90s.  It was called Neutral Milk Hotel and it was vastly superior to these con-artists called the Decemberists.  Before you disagree with me, go pick up Neutral Milk hotel's In the Aeroplane over the Sea (1997), and then try to disagree"
5,"Carbon Leaf's sound continues to evolve, and the results are outstanding. The band says it has given up trying to ""define"" its style of music, since it's a shifting blend of so many influences and original ideas. In the past, Carbon Leaf has played variations of rootsy folk-rock with Celtic, bluegrass, and alt-pop flourishes. This new album is focused more on a clean but no less impressive, straightforward pop-rock sound that's catchy without being cloying, radio-friendly without being superficial. Even with this focus, there's excellent variety: ""Block of Wood"" has a gorgeous country-rock lilt, for example, while ""International Airport"" flirts with jazz. All in all, this is a polished gem that deserves to be the band's breakout album.  The songs range from engaging (""Bright Lights,"" ""Love Loss Hope Repeat"") to anthemic (""Learn to Fly,"" ""Comfort"") to heartbreaking (""Block of Wood"") to humorous (""A Girl and Her Horse"") to profound (""The War Was in Color""). If you enjoy infectious melodies, stunning harmonies, thought-provoking and often bittersweet lyrics, beautiful instrumentation, and pristine, finely crafted production, you will love this album.   There are acoustic rhythm guitars aplenty, neatly embellished with subtle electric guitar riffs and fills (Terry Clark and Carter Gravatt), anchored by a killer rhythm section (Jordan Medas on bass and Scott Milstead on drums) and some touches of mandolin (Gravatt again). This album also has a bit more keyboard work than some of Carbon Leaf's earlier releases, courtesy of guest musician Tim Lauer. Soaring above it all is the clear, resonant and at times hypnotic voice of lead singer Barry Privett, who also writes all of the band's lyrics.  This is my favorite release of 2006 so far, along with ""Ganging Up on the Sun"" by Guster. Both new and longtime fans of Carbon Leaf have much to celebrate with ""Love, Loss, Hope, Repeat."
4,One thing I love about greatest hits packages from groups with only one legitimate hit is that you never grow tired of them. Timbuk 3's greatest hits package is a good place to start enjoying their music and you will not  get tired of hearing songs you've heard a million times on the radio. If  you want more info on the band seach the web because there is a least one  great web site. After buying this CD and the live one you will have to  seach the used bins and I highly recommend the album Eden Alley
5,"This soundtrack is excellent. There is not a single song that I skip when listening to the cd.  The mix of recent and older songs sung by familiar and unfamiliar artists is great.  Anita Nalick, Breathe (2a.m.) is worth the price of the album."
5,"I haven't bought an album for such a long time because who needs to spend the extra cash when there's online piracy? But I have to own this.  Feinstein's voice is so pure and versatile; he is funny at a moment and the next, he can be so heartbreakingly bittersweet. His performance is first class, and one has to consider that he can sing so well at a live concert.  "
4,"I have maybe a hundred Christmas CDs (it's a hobby) but I think this is the only one with the ""Explicit Lyrics"" warning!  This is fore just for one song ""Here Comes Fatty Claus"" which featured a fairly prominent use of the ""sh*t"" word.  I have a fairly young child and burnt a copy of the CD without that song. She loves it!  As for the CD... it's pretty good. Waters has managed to collect the best of campy Christmas songs, something unique as far as I'm aware.    But it's not just a novelty CD... the songs are good. This isn't intentional camp... it is sincere stuff with MAYBE the exception of the Tiny Time song. (One of my daughter's favorite, because it's well done."
1,"As if Fiddy Cent wasn't enough to make me break some bones, this horrible trend of Kayne West comes in. What is there to be said that hasn't been said? Nothing, really; my work has been done by all the one-star reviewers. All I have to say is that I hope this rapper fades away from the universe sooner or later.  Want good rap? Go for Tupac (R.I.P.) or Public Enemy"
1,"Most people considered this the Cheap Trick &quot;comeback&quot; album.  Sixteen years after the fact I'm forced to admit that it ranks as more of a &quot;go-back&quot; album instead.  While Cheap Trick didn't set the music world on fire with most of their 80's releases, it wasn't until the rot set in on the unbelievably sub-par release &quot;The Doctor&quot; that I actively had to search for something good to say about one of their albums.  On &quot;The Doctor&quot; I searched but came up empty.  &quot;Lap Of Luxury&quot; isn't quite that bad, but it set a bad tone for the releases to follow.  I've made dozens of Cheap Trick compilations over the years and &quot;Let Go&quot; was the only song that I included off of LOL.  The thing that consistently irritated me with each subsequent release in the 80's and early 90's was the press release that was issued saying how this was the album that took the Trick back to their rockin' roots.  Well let me tell ya, this is far from it.  I know.  I remember"
5,"Dan Zanes is great! My husband and I both enjoy listening to this as well as our 20 month old. Most of the other music CD's that we have for our son I find a little irritating after a bit of listening. Rocket Ship Beach is fun, family music! I highly recommend this to all ages"
1,"Wow!!! This is a horrible album. I really enjoyed Comin' From Where I'm From, so I expected good things from this one right here. Wrong. On the title track Anthony Hamilton comes with some potentially positive socially-conscience lyrics, then he starts talking about praying. Of course mythological-minded cult people aren't worried, they think mythical magical people will come out of the sky and fix everything if they just stay on their knees. The four subsequent songs are full on Jesus songs. People want warning labels for albums they deem to be offensive for whatever reason, but they need some kind of cult warning. I would not have purchased this CD had I known it was on some cult mess. In ""Preacher's Daughter"" he even says ""A preacher's daugher so she had common sense."" I'm not sure if that's supposed to be a joke, but common sense should tell one magic people don't live in the clouds. Then ""Pass Me Over"" reminds me of the that two-part skit on Ice Cube's Lethal Injection where the cat is just sitting there waiting for Jesus and gives Ice Cube all his stuff, 'cause he thinks Jesus will give him new stuff. But Anthony Hamilton tries to make it sound like a positive thing to just sit there and wait for mythology to become reality. If people think this type of behavior is a real solution to one's personal problems or the worlds problems then I, for one, am very worried about our future, or probable complete lack there of. That's a very dangerous mind state. ""Sista Big Bones"" is a good song, but it's not worth purchasing this"
4,"Bubble from Ab Fab sounds exactly like Marilyn Monroe, Billie Holiday, Judy Garland and others.  What a talent.  She needs her own Las Vegas Show.  She would be beyond great!  "
5,"Lots and lots of positive and negative reviews about this record in a comparison sense to their previous work it seems. Honestly, I didn't know of any personnel changes to and/or from the band prior to listening to it three times through. Evanescence is the real deal. Enjoy! Five Stars."
5,"I'm one of those people who didn't really *know* anything about Beck.  Oh sure I knew his hits - ""Loser"", ""Where It's At"", ""The New Pollution"" et al.  Just never really thought much about the guy.  Until...about three months ago when I downloaded a couple tracks from this album from Napster2Go...""E Pro"" and ""Girl"".  After giving them a few listens I downloaded the entire Guero album not long thereafter.  I don't know what to say that hasn't already been said by a lot of others here- it's been voted one of the Best of 2005 for a REASON.  This is an AWESOME album.  During a looong road trip I played some of the tracks for my Better Half and he gradually got addicted...starting with ""Earthquake Weather"".  Now it's not only this album but pretty much the entire Beck catalog for the two of us :) Even the songs I started out being ""meh"" about grew on me (and hubby) BIG TIME.  Just a great album...musicianship is spot on, and Beck definitely has a strong sense of humor mixed with a healthy dose of irony!  The tracks which are STANDOUTS (at least in our opinion) are E-Pro (great kick start to the album); Que Onda' Guero (LOVE the lowrider horns throughout, along with the ""Hey! Guero!"" random shouts); Girl (catchy...this should have been a HUGE hit...); Earthquake Weather (haunting melody, great riff!), Hell Yes (hai!); and I really love Rental Car...just a cute little song - way too short...also catchy riff and verses!  DO check this album out.  Absolutely a gem"
5,"""Alt-country"" would indeed be a limiting description,none-the-less an accurate point of reference,as this artist is obviously drawing from past Country musicians.But make no mistake,this is not a tired retread thru the same-old same-old but rather an exceptional modern piece of music.I'm usually more inclined towards the Heavy than the twangy,but this is just so well written and catchy with a distinct melancholic cloud hanging over the proceedings,and this woman can SING.One of the few recent musicians that deserve that designation"
5,"After the profound impact of the David Rawlings produced ""O.C.M.S.,"" to my music collection, my pre-order of ""Big Iron World"" came with pretty high expectations. I've listened to it three times since receiving it in the mail last night and though it doesn't sport tracks with the immediate staying power of ""Wagon Wheel,"" ""Big Iron World"" does pull some wonderfully surprising punches. Though he doesn't capture OCMS's live act at it's fullest (and who really could), Rawlings' production once again manages to maintain OCMS's authenticity and pushes their ""old-time"" music into the modern area, without a hint of the tacky, over-produced, artificial, gimmicks, heard on other neo-bluegrass records.   ""Big Iron World"" is not an album stuck in history, or looking to bite of the accomplishments of the past. With ""Big Iron World,"" OCMS once again displays its own sound, pushing the limits of bluegrass/county/rock/punk/folk forward, while paying its respect and harkening back to the fables of Woody Guthrie, the picking of Muleskinner and the late 60's albums of Dylan. Moreover, the songs of ""Big Iron World"" comprise a complete body of work. The pro-union, ""Union Maid"" and folksy ""James River Blues"" are the standout tracks on an album that works as a whole, with each song complementing the next. As with all of OCMS's albums, ""Big Iron World"" is a breath of fresh air in comparison to most other albums put out by artists of a similar age.  They have put together a great collection of songs to be enjoyed by fans of numerous genres."
5,"by far, Picture This, is my favorite cd from the JB collection...have three copies...one for the home, one for the car, and another he personally signed for me at one of his concerts! Been a fan of his since he appeared on tv talk show back in late 1997...despite our daily hectic schedules, his music always brings us back to a place that is calm, relaxing & peaceful...now that we have small children, they are even accustomed to listening his music, which makes bedtime even sweeter! :)"
1,"You got to be kidding me right? People actually giving this album 5 stars. Wow people are so blind it isn't even funny. This is all commercialized garbage. E-40 is all on this ""hyphy"" tip now, lmao how wack is that. Hyphy is straight wack, the lyrics have no concept what so ever. All pointless.  Production, well yea all these commercialized albums got production, like this album. But then again where are the lyrics?   This is one of those albums where you sit there and like it ONLY because of the beat/hook lol. People that listen to this type of music dont like real Hip-Hop, as I said theyre blind. People that arent big Hip-Hop fans, I dont criticize you for listening, but all you people that claim to be Hip-Hop fans, f*** outta here, you aint.   This album is for commercial rap listeners only, if you like underground STAY away from this at all costs. Pick up some real HipHop instead.  Peace. "
2,"When I first bought this cd I really liked it, but unlike most other cd's it sounded worse with time. After 2-3 months it was just sitting in my drawer and I found myself skipping stations on the radio when they played the Killers. After seeing them live at the Virgin Festival this weekend I know they are totally phony, not only is their cd bland but they are the worst live band ever. Do yourself a favor save your money on this one"
5,"When I make a long night drive home after a loud concert,      I like to listen to something quiet and soothing.  THE PIZZA TAPES is one of my favorite quiet and soothing picks, it's a sweet masterpiece of acoustic jamming and inspired playing.  During two days in February of 1993 Garcia, Grisman and Rice got together to fiddle around with some tunes and see how they came out on tape.  As we all know, the recordings were stolen by the infamous ""Pizza boy"" and soon they became property of the formidable Grateful Dead tape and CD trading community.  Several years later Grisman remastered the recordings and put out the best takes on this album.  This isn't an album of electric jams, it's rather impromptu, quiet and easygoing.  Some people might dismiss it as ""background music.""  However if you take a closer listen, the trio handles the traditional tunes and Bob Dylan tunes and the Gershwin (!) tunes with such skill, there's hardly an uninspired or false note anywhere to be found.  Garcia screws up here and there but even those mistakes are a pleasure to listen to.  Definitely a classic album and something I received with anticipation.  I still enjoy putting this on and it gets better with successive listenings.  By the way, I love the cover art... the CD case is made to resemble a pizza box.  Open it up and the disc is a pizza pie with all the toppings.  On the back is a menu of all the treats including some spicy items (choice words from Garcia!)  I actually get the craving for pizza when I'm listening to the album.  The PIZZA TAPES sure is one tasty album. Great music and great pizza, what a winning combination!"
2,"Pls. Rick Nielsen, ""Tell Me Everything""! Why did  you guys get a sorry Producer like Ted Templeman  to Produce what could have been a great comeback  LP? If you Trick fans wanna be in 'My Gang' then  you gotta spread the news to pray for better ef- forts than this in the future if the Tricksters  are gonna stay employed!  'You're All I Wanna Do' and the title track, with it's ""Mommy and Daddy"" chorus, is kinda  cool and retro for 'Surrender' - now the mar- riage is on the rocks! Like Cheap Trick's ca- reer after this disgrace! It's enough to make  you 'Cry Baby'...Pls. bring back Brant!"
1,"I bought this disk on the strength of the reviews here at Amazon.  What a major disappointment this disk is.  Embarrasingly amateur, with keyboard loop drums and keyboard basses, it is difficult to believe that these are well-known professional reggae singers as well.  Another case of &quot;dumbing-down&quot; music for children, something definitely not required to fully engage kids with music (the outstanding Putamayo series for example is presented no frills, no dumbing-down).  Good &quot;children's music&quot; inspires both parents and kids, and kids react positively to that in their parents. A shame to pay $... for this disk"
5,"I MUST SAY THAT WHEN I FIRST HEARD ""KICK PUSH"" I THOUGHT TO MYSELF THAT THIS GUY REALLY HAD SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE HE IS SUCH A METAPHORIC RHYMER AND HIS DELIVERY IS VERY STRONG SO I KNOW I HAD TO BUY LUPE FIASCO'S DEBUT ALBUM ""FOOD AND LIQUOR"". AFTER LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM FROM BEGINNING TO END I WAS NOT AT ALL DISAPPOINTED BUT INDEED THIS ALBUM REALLY LET ME KNOW THAT THERE ARE STILL A FEW RAPPERS OUT THERE THAT ARE STILL KICKING RHYMES ABOUT ISSUES THAT WE DEAL WITH IN EVERYDAY LIFE INSTEAD OF HEARING THESE OTHER MC'S THAT DONT RAP ABOUT ANYTHING EXCEPT CARS, CLOTHES, JEWELRY, AND WOMEN. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO ANYONE THAT IS A FAN OF REAL RAP BECAUSE THIS ALBUM WILL OPEN YOUR EYES TO ALOT OF THINGS IN LIFE.  MY 5 FAVORITE TRACKS ARE: 1.""THE COOL""- THIS SONG IS BASICALLY ABOUT A YOUNG MAN WHO HAD DIED(NOT LITERALLY) BUT HE WAS ABLE TO COME BACK TO LIFE AND TRY TO MAKE A CHANGE FOR THE BETTER BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE CHOSE TO LIVE HIS LIFE THE SAME WAY HE HAD LIVED IT ONCE BEFORE. SONG IS VERY METAPHOR AND DEEP. 2.""HE SAY SHE SAY""- THIS SONG IS ABOUT A LITTLE BOY WHO DOESNT HAVE A VISIBLE FATHER AND IT IS AFFECTING HIM DEEPLY. 3.""HURT ME SOUL""- THIS SONG TALKS JUST ABOUT ANY ISSUE YOU CAN THINK OF FROM WOMEN BEING DEGRADED IN RAP MUSIC, DRUG DEALING, CROOKED COPS, GOVERNMENT NOT OFFERING BLACK PEOPLE WELFARE AND OVERCHARGING HEALTHCARE, JOHNS AND PROSTITUTES. SONG ALSO HAS A VERY NICE HOOK. 4.""SUNSHINE""- THIS SONG IS ABOUT THIS GIRL THAT HE FALLS IN LOVE WITH IN A CLUB EVENTHOUGH HE'S NOT LOOKING FOR LOVE HE CANNOT RESIST IT WITH THIS GIRL. 5.""PRESSURE"" FEATURING JAY-Z- VERY NICE CONCEPT TO IT FROM LUPE'S STANDPOINT AND EVENTHOUGH IM NOT A BIG JAY-Z FAN HE STILL PUT DOWN A NICE VERSE.  OTHER SONGS I LIKE ARE ""JUST MIGHT BE OK"", ""DAYDREAMININ"", ""KICK PUSH"", ""I GOTCHA"",""INSTRUMENTAL"", AND ""AMERICAN TERRORISTS"".  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO ANYONE WHO IS A TRUE FAN OF REAL RAP BECAUSE IT WILL NOT DISAPPOINT YOU AT ALL!!!!"
5,"I can't rate this one highly enough. It's certainly in a vein with his last couple, but, as has been oft noted, it's more political and full of social commentary. Some people will like it a little less than the two preceding ones, as a result. I expected to have that reaction, but I found the socially conscious elements surprisingly compelling after all, and Rodney melds them well with his more personal insights, which ultimately predominate in the end. Also, focusing on the social commentary can obscure the fact that a good number of these songs are just a lot of fun, like a slightly angrier and more introspective version of the wonderful stuff he did with the Notorious Cherry Bombs.  By the way, if you like this album, you may want to pick up the book ""Rednecks & Bluenecks: The Politics of Country Music."" It's not just about the country you hear on the radio but also alternative country and Americana. And Rodney shows up prominently throughout the book; there's a whole section just about this album"
1,"I was looking at the Billboard Hot 100 last year like I do every week, and at one point I noticed a song that was making moves was ""Grind With Me"" by Pretty Ricky. I had never heard of the song, and after I listened to it, I wished I still hadn't heard of the song. I don't know what possessed me to listen to the full-length album, Bluestars, but I did and, well, I couldn't get the CD out of my stereo fast enough.  I agree with reviewer Hakeem when he said that all these five-star reviews must be from people that are on the group's street team or something. Pretty Ricky consists of four people: three rappers (Spectacular, Diamond ""Baby Blue"", and Slick -- and I use the term ""rapper"" loosely) and one singer (Pleasure). The problem with this album is that these are the horniest AND most talentless guys I have ever heard of, and that is a terrible combination. The lead single ""Grind With Me"" is really called ""Grind On Me"", and it's one of the nastiest things I have ever heard, but ""Playhouse"" isn't far behind. And ""Nothing But a Number"" is very, very statutory.  Also annoying is their use of dated lyrics, like ""If lovin' you is wrong, I don't wanna be right"" on ""Grind On Me"", or ""If I'm lyin', I'm flyin'"" on ""Grill `Em"" (what does that even mean, anyway?). The guys also have a habit of continually yelling certain adlibs, like ""FROM THE BACK!"" on ""Get a Little Closer"", and ""Yes, sir!"" on ""Your Body"". Also, while Pleasure's singing isn't HORRIBLE, it's hard to listen to after all that wack rapping. Actually, his chorus on ""Shorty Be Mine"" is sure to cause you DISpleasure.  Speaking of that song, things are equally unimpressive when the guys DON'T talk about sex, like on ""Never Let You Go"", ""Can't Live Without You"", and the obligatory bling-blingin' songs ""Chevy"" and ""Grill `Em"". But in the long run I guess all that doesn't matter because nobody cares about Pretty Ricky any more and as my brother said, they're probably now back to working at Wendy's. If I ever come across the Bluestars CD again, in the words of ""Your Body"", dammit, I'll beat it up.  Anthony Ruper"
5,"Wow...what a great collection of songs, a wonderful album. I am a fan of the Church, but even if you have never heard of them, you will find this disc amazing. I am at a loss of words to decribe the songs. My only regret is that there is not a DVD of performances of these songs. I would go upstairs and watch it all night"
5,Really well done. This is an extremely well crafted CD. Six Days is probably the best song on here.  Note: The song when they're waiting for bow wow's car is       Ooh Aah - Grit
2,"I was unable to play in my car CD player, so only choice I got is to listen at home using my home DVD player."
1,"I have listened to this cd, also watched the dvd, of John Fogerty's long road home on amazon. Nothing can compare to his Dvd of Premonition.I own It love it, Put it on and  makes me  rock out, With one of the best entertainers In his prime time of life.The guitars and Instruments he plays is awesome to watch a legend of great talent.His voice Is so excellent & clear.Had some friends over with John's Premonition dvd playing.It took all of us back to that time In history.They all went to amazon and bought Premonition.I know soon they will all be gone.I went back to buy one more the price is so reasonable.As I consider Premonition to be a Collector's dvd.If you see it again.Do not wait buy it while they are available. I know its a Import as most dvds are today.Mine plays excellent In audio and picture.You feel like you are sitting in the audience with John performing.Give Premonition 10 Stars.Anything after John's Premonition dvd can not compare to it.No matter how hard they try to bring back his music on a Cd or a dvd.Premonition Is the best dvd  of all of times. All the rest get 1 Star for trying. Though not coming close to what I call  my Collector's Edition  dvd of John Fogerty's Prmonition. "
2,"Just listening to few extracts of Chopin Sonata on Amazon.com made it clear to me - I don't want to hear the rest. Let's take the Scherzo (2nd movement), for example. Lang Lang plays the middle episode not just ""a little slow"" but at least twice as slow. Whereas if you look in the score you'll see a strikingly different picture - Chopin (the composer!) asked for no tempo change, he never canceled Molto Vivace. Unfortunately, it is very common when a performer changes things here and there, so it sounds so called original and ""deep"", rather then trying to read attentively the composer's code, understand and make sense of it. I trust Chopin's genius and never those who put their ego above the existing Beauty.     "
2,"I dont see how anybody can call this an album. This is a mixtape. Lil Wayne basically freestyled through the whole album! The beats are bland and only a few of Wayne's freestyles are tight. Standout freestyles: THE MOBB, MONEY ON MY MIND, FIREMAN, OH NO, HIT EM'UP and IM A DBOY. Filler freestyles: shooter, receipt, grown man, feel me, hustler music, mo fire etc. lock and load is a boring track and Kurupt is whispering in the hook (WTF!). Its obvious that he was trying to get an up north fanbase to buy this s---. The majority of reviewers who gave him five stars come from up north. Lil Wayne's best albums are LIGHTS OUT AND THE CARTER. Lil Wayne at his worst: THE BLOCK IS HOT, 500 DEGREES and THE CARTER 2."
2,"I normally don't write reviews that are negative on amazon because they usually get nothing but negative feedback/unhelpful votes or whatever. So I shall try to be as fair as possible. I got Leonard Cohen's compilation ""i'm your man"" and there is this amazing, incredible rendition of ""if it be your will"" that Antony does. It was my favorite track on this record and the whole Leonard Cohen tribute concert in general, 'come so far for beauty' is really good. ""If It be your will"" was performed with such a soulful voice and i loved how it built inself until the end with the background vocals wailing and him stating the title words over and over. So I went to the library and waited a month to borrow this debut record by Antony; it was always checked out or on reserve. Yes, it was the same voice, and yes, I will say, Antony does have a very interesting and even somewhat beautiful voice. The album's sleeve put me off at first (and continued to do so). I am someone who often puts music together with its cover art (check out This Mortal Coil's 'song to the siren' with that perfect 23 envelope sleeve, for example). So I listened to this album a few times and was put off by the silly lyrics that actually made me grimace and cringe. ""mr muscles forcing bursting stingy little thingy into me . . ."" or ""i am so very happy, so please hit me"" or ""river of sorrow, don't swallow"" or the breathy way he says the word ""twilight"" don't know, it just made a little uncomfortable. So it seemed I didn't like the record.   Then I read an article in INTERVIEW magazine with Elton John about new music in 2005, he was praising Antony's second record. So I gave it another try and after three songs, couldn't handle it anymore. The images of the cd and the things he sings about or his presentation of the words ruin it. Maybe if he just sang songs by poets like Leonard Cohen it would be better? In the Elton John article, he said Antony sings a lot about sexuality, which I gathered from the lyrics, and but he presents his sexuality in such a pathetic way that almost says ""if you don't like me, or if you are not drawn to this sad life I am presenting to you, it's because you don't like gay/transgendered people"". In my case, that couldn't be further from the truth. I would not recommend this record to anyone, but when I mention it to people, I can't help but say how much I loved ""if it be your will"" and how disappointed I was in his solo effort."
2,"Sounds just like the last record if you ask me.  Always has a great band, arrangements, and mixing, but Bob's still trying to paint the picture of natural disasters, old cars, the dustbowl, Annie, Frannie, Sarah, Ruth and whatever other old timey nonsense he can come up with.  God bless him"
1,"I don't care what others stated...Sabata rushed the opera to fit the LP capability, Maria screamed at all times, no pianissimis, and everyone was super high charged like they must finish the recording on time to fit the album.  Best Tosca is Maria Callas with Pretre recording.  Don't buy this mono recording.  Maria did not understand who Tosca was during this moment"
2,"Aside from having what is possibly the most laughably awful name for a band I've ever heard, these guys just really don't do it for me.  A lot of the music is fairly decent, but the singer is just incredibly annoying.  Now, I am certainly not a stickler on vocal perfection, but this dude is really bad.  I've heard drunk guys in karaoke bars that I'd rather listen to.    But like I said, the band overall isn't completely terrible.  They're decent musicians, and I like a lot of the music, but I just really cannot get around that singer.  Ordinarily, it's not a good idea to judge a band by their name, but um...this isn't one of those times"
1,"perhaps it's a bit unfair because lucinda engenders such high expectations, but i was really disappointed with this record the songwriting is weak, the singing is weak, and the arrangements are dull  something kicked all the life out of the music--the songs are not all the same, but for some reason they all sound the same--and embarrassingly, you can sing most of them after one listen, they are so simplistic and cliched"
5,I love this new CD from Amos Lee.    The first single is entitled Shout Out Loud.  This song really puts me in a great mood.  His guitar playing is so energetic here.  My favorite track is Long Line Of Pain though.  It is a beautiful song about personal loss and loneliness. Sympathize is an another highlight on this disc.  Amos Lee's subtle voice is filled with compassion for people who are down on their luck.  Southern Girl is Amos' tribute to the  charm of a girl from the south.  Night Train is a very pretty love song. Skipping Stone is a bluesy sounding song about trying to move on after the loss of a loved one.  Freedom is an interesting track.  It is a reminder that the pursuit of  freedom should not lead to violence.  The lyrics of this song are true and thought provoking. Sweet Pea is a simple and sweet song about coming home to someone special.  Careless is an excellent song about the betrayal of a friend.  I love the feeling of loss and sense of  hurt in Amos' voice on this track.   Supply and Demand is a very entertaining CD by a talented young musician and song writer
2,"I got these CDs based on some reviews, but I can not take the singing.  There are far too many little kids singing, and the adults are no better.  It is WAY too gimmicky.  If you want just traditional songs sung nicely, this is not the set for you!  I am going to copy the songs I like and make my own CD - I think there are maybe 2 songs per CD I'll use!  BAD"
5,"Once again, Audra McDonald proves that she's the best musical theatre singer since Streisand. While many fans might quibble with her selections (mostly covers of rock and pop songs), her voice and her intepretations are seocnd to none"
2,"Although I'm a great fan of the brothers work, I feel this album an insult to the serious Bee Gees collector.  The tracks here are not rare, new or even unavailable.  Time for Barry & Robin to get back in there and give their army of fans a treat instead of another compilation rip-off.  Even Robin's latest redition ""A Live CD"" whoooooopie doo, again songs of old hat.....I'm hungry for new material not oldies.  And please don't get me wrong, it broke my heart when Maurice died, my world stopped and I do sympathise with Barry, Robin and the rest of their family.  Being a fan for 30 something years I've loved their music since the beginning and will carry on doing so for years to come....But please some new songs are needed from the brothers.  So come on Barry get together with Robin and show us the great writing talent you still have.  A devoted listener talisman, Dundee "
1,"The Black Eyed Peas are the WORST group is rap HISTORY! Its hard to believe that anyone could make music worse than the Black Eyed Peas. This group is an embarasment to Rap, Hip-Hop, R&B, and any other type of music ever created. How and why people continue to support these lame, extremely non-talented rejects of the rap world is completely unbelievable. I thought thier last CD was trash, but this has incredibly surpassed the low mark set by Elephunk, which should have been called, ""Hey let'sell out and attempt to create the worst music ever known to man"". The only good news is that theyll soon be forgotten about as they have just murdered thier musical careers, and will have to resort to doing jingles for commmercials in order to survive. These three unoriginal, talentless, boring, annoying, sellout, fake wanna-bes should stop making ANY kind of music and get completely out of the music business. Tonight I willl pray very hard that these bafoons of the music industry NEVER make another song EVER!!!! To say that they SUCK would be a compliment, they would have to practice constantly for the next 1,000 years THEN make a deal with the devil just to scrape up enough talent to suck! Theyre just that HORRIBLE!!"
1,"Jamie Foxx might be best known as a mediocre actor (with one good performance as ""Ray."").  But now he can best known now as a mediocre singer/writer.  While he has a good voice, he's either corny or has no hooks.  Basically, there is no substance but he figures he can capitalize after the movie ""Ray.""  And to anyone who says that he can write good songs, let's look at a song and see his wonderful poetic lyrics:   Yo you sleep  Naw I just um, I think I want some more  Yea I know we just got through  But its just so good, I just caint help it tho'  Its something about your body  Naw it aint all I think about  Well to be honest, oh   Im startin' to believe,  Something's wrong wit me,  Cause everyday, every night, every hour, every minute  I'm thinkin' `bout it  I can be at my job, in my car, up in church  And when I try to pray it off, it won't work  It seems that I caint get enough of   [Chorus:]  (Sex) All the time  (Sex) On my mind  (Sex) Everywhere I go  (Sex) I'm tryna let you know  (Sex) It's stronger than any drug even love  S-E-X ohhheee  (Sex) Can make you crazy  (Sex) Can make a baby  (Sex) All night long  (Sex) It's the perfect song  (Sex) Stronger than any drug even love  S-E-X oh   Its getting to the point where I (where I)  I watch it on TV when I buy DVDs  Thirty-nine ninety-nine for the new releases (39.99 for the new releases)  I aint proud of it, cause it's getting in the way of love for me  And I caint help it, caint shake it  (You know what) Sometimes I hear it calling me   [Chorus:]  (Sex) All the time  (Sex) On my mind  (Sex) Everywhere I go  (Sex) I'm tryna let you know  (Sex) It's stronger than any drug even love  S-E-X ohhheee  (Sex) Can make you crazy  (Sex) Can make a baby  (Sex) All night long  (Sex) It's the perfect song  (Sex) Stronger than any drug even love  S-E-X oh   Some call it bad, some call it good  Some do it bourgeois, some do it hood  I do it hood (can I say that one more time) girl I do it hood ohh   Some like it slow, some like it fast  It don't matter the tempo long as it lasts  I make it last (can I say that one more time) girl I make it last ohh    -Wow, that's a big pile of garbage!  Lyrics like that should easily win him a Grammy.  Keep it up, Jamie! "
2,"There are 3 or 4 good songs on this CD. If you want to purchase it to make your own compilation for your kids they will love a few of them. Others are WAY to slow and boring for kids to get excited about. There are a couple of them that make no sense at all on a chilren's CD. It seems like they couldn't decide whether to make a CD to put kids to sleep or to pep them up so they did both on one CD. That doesn't work for my kids. John Lithgow ""Singin in the Bathtub"" is a MUCH better choice. The songs are upbeat and lively. My kids ask for that one all the time"
5,"Like all of Antony's Music, this EP has a chilling and superhuman quality to it. Unlike his other stuff, the production is toned down on the non-album tracks (""The Lake"" and ""The Horror Is Gone"") to a stark, white-faced beauty that for me defines the core of Antony & The Johnsons. The album track, ""Fistful of Love"", is one of my favourite Antony songs, a soulful and grooving lament that makes a convincing argument for masochism as an uplifting and redemptive fetish.  Though the price is a bit steep, this is a great addition to any Antony fan's library"
4,"I am not a CLAY-MATE... howver, Clay Aiken is without-a-doubt the best runner-up from any season of AI.  That being said...I still wasn't sure if I would like this CD.  And I didn't---at first.  But then, after hearing it a few more times, I actually grew to like most of the songs.  Not all of them, which is why I didn't give him 5 stars, but it is a very good album.  My favorite happens to be the title track.  But, there are several more good songs on the CD.  Whether or not you are into this style of music, you can't argue that Clay Aiken has one of the best male voices around.  Probably the best male voice of his age.  I would recommend this CD to any one who is into Adult Contemporary.  Of course, if you are a Clay-mate, then I don't have to tell you anything :"
1,"As a big fan of the Postal Service (their ""Give Up"" easily makes the cut on my top 10 albums), I had high expectations for this Dntel record, as Jimmy Tamberello is one half of the Postal Service. BIG mistake. Listen to the samples: if you like what you hear, then buy it; if you don't like what you hear, don't make my mistake of thinking that the songs get better beyond the 30 seconds given. Worthwhile songs on this CD: 1)""(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan"" (The Postal Service remix is available on iTunes, and is a better version than what's on the CD), sung by Ben Gibbard of Death Cab and Postal Service. 2)""Last Songs"" is if anything, relaxing. I recommend getting these two songs on iTunes and leaving it at that, save some money.  The CD's too expensive for two decent songs.  Jimmy Tamberello has another digital project that he works called Figurine and (more recently) James Figurine, it's essentially a catchier, poppier version of Dntel, more in line with Postal Service"
4,"This is a very different sounding Paul Simon album.  The influence of Brian Eno is obvious and at times over-the-top.  My conclusion, now that I've had this album for a while, is that it's not one that I'm constantly listening to but, when I'm in the mood, this is really an interesting and fun album.  Occasionally, Paul reaches heights I don't feel he's reached since Graceland.  There are some great songs on here.  If you're looking for ""Still Crazy after all these years"" or ""50 Ways to Leave Your Lover"" - type songs, you're not going to find them here.  If you're interested in hearing Paul push the envelope, however, this is the one.  Paul hits the mark more often than he misses it on this one"
1,"I have always admired the experimental spirit in any artist. As a visual artist I am constantly trying new things in my work and every once in a while I stumble upon some new element or concept that withstands the ""look at it a week from now and see how you feel"" test. Other times I churn out pieces of junk which I spare the world from looking at. Animal Collective should have reconsidered releasing this often silly and pointless collection of sounds. It is an artistic experiment that failed. I hope this is only true about this particular disc (the only AC I have heard) as it would be a shame for someone to be consistently putting out pieces of artistic crap for any length of time and still be getting away with it."
2,"I have decided to compose an album of mostly kindergarten children yelling about cats while someone opens and closes the door to a beginner's music class, and I will call it art.  People will write many reviews about the music, and they will say it is wonderful, and that it captures the essence of youth while retaining the wisdom of the ages.  They will do this because they are afraid to say that is stinks.  Music is not suppossed to hurt the ears.  To call this good music is an insult to good musicians.    I will give them credit for being brave enough to buy massive quantities of drugs from some dealer, for clearly they were higher than a kite, no, make that a weather ballon, when they composed the album.  Creative; maybe.  Listenable, enjoyable, humable, playable when company is over; no"
1,"I'm going to start this off by saying that I am NOT the biggest Andrew Lloyd Webber fan.  Some of his works are amazing, like Joseph and various songs from each of his musicals, yet overall he tries to incorporate a very fake sounding pop opera into most of his shows.  Unfortunately, The Woman in White, his first try at gothic opera, is even worse. Webber obviously tried to pretend that the score for the musical was quality, thought-provoking work by jam-packing it with dissonant chords and loud orchestrations, but they only show how little he truly knows about music.  Half of the show's score is little short of random notes that seem to have no connection (almost as if he tried to imitate the genius of Sondheim).  The tunes are bland, the book is boring and confusing, and many of the performances are sub-par.  For instance, the actrees portraying the Woman in White simply shrieks throughout the entire CD.  Even when she sings, her screaming din hurts one's ears.  It seems as if she decided to cover the underdevelopment of her character with noise.  The other actors are generally adequite, yet they have so little to work with that their portrayals seem dull. Admittedly, there are some highlights to this CD, such as Crawford's amazing portrayal of Count Fosco (especially the live version of You Can Get Away With Anything...it is HILARIOUS!), but overall, the CD is hard to take in.  Some songs are quite beautiful, yet the track on which they resign are also full of shrieking, dull dialogue, and loud music.  I think it is a tell-tale sign of a flop when on a live-version CD of a musical, only one song is accompanied by reaction from the audience"
1,"Boy, and I thought ""Cats"" was bad. This is the single most boring, stupid, pointless and utterly awful piece of music garbage that has ever had the misfortune to befoul my ears. There is no story line, no range in music, no feeling, no lyrics to back up the awful music. I mean, the list could go on forever. I warn you, it's the biggest waste of $25.00 that you might, no, will ever spend. PLEASE, do yourself a favor and trust me. DON""T BUY THE CD!!! And if you do, when you put it on, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.You've been warned. Now please, spend your well earned money on something that actually has a purpose in life"
5,"If you like this album, if you like the title track, it might inspire a few hard core fans to know that the original inspiration for both the name of the band, and especially the title track, is the masterpiece of a western, ""Bad Company""- 1972.  The whole piano instrumental is practically lifted from the film's soundtrack, by ""Fantasticks"" Harvey Schmidt.  The song is a very haunting one which was a bit of an enigma for me until I saw the film itself.  It stars Barry Brown and Jeff Bridges.  It's worthwhile for not only western fans of every considerable imagination, but to fans of the band itself, to help make the song more meaningful, as it has for me!!  I highly recommend them both"
5,"I have held back from doing an online review because I recognize that my objectivity isn't well, very objective when it comes to Elton John.  I love everything he does (even ""Victim of Love""!).  But I could no longer resist.  This CD is magnificent.  Elton John and Bernie Taupin have crafted a work that spans generations, bridges gaps and even pays homage to personal and artistic lapses over the years.  It is an honest, courageous and celebratory reflection of the terrain these two geniuses have traversed over some 37 years.  That's the depth of ""The Captain and the Kid.""  But let's not get lost in the depths here, either.  This CD is one great listen.  Even if you're not interested in the history...even if you're just a casual fan (can one just be a casual Elton John fan??)  or just like good music, ""The Captain and the Kid"" is great entertainment.  It has it all...great arrangements, great piano playing from Elton and of course, hooks abound.  No one...that's right, no one can write a hook like Elton.  These songs stay with you...they become your companions on YOUR journey, and like good wine, they get better and better.  I must also write a word of support for all who have written regarding so many artists doing retreads of old standards/hits.  I know, I know, this stuff is selling like there's no tomorrow.  I suppose, as much as I can't bear another Rod Stewart retread CD ( I loved Rod though most of his career...I just can't stand what he's done over the last five years...Rod...please STOP!) I guess the attraction/appeal of these CD's is that the buyer knows they're going to get a full CD's worth of good (or at least known) songs from a reliable artist.  True, it is not as easy as it used to be to find many CD's today that are original and good from start to finish...CD's tend to be longer than LP's and therefore run the risk of running out of steam, and let's face it...many do. Oh, the classic CD's, they're out there, you might have to do some mining before striking gold, however.  Sadly, ""The Captain and the Kid"" did not ignite the charts.  I cannot understand it. And I do realize that popularity has nothing to do with greatness. Yet, this IS truly a great CD, a work of art that deserves to be heard.  It is a throw back to the glory days, yet it is not dated in the least. And one listen...just one puts you right back on the yellow brick road, platform shoes and all! No, I suppose you can't go back...not totally anyway, but it is oh so nice take one more sweet ride with The Captain and the Kid. "
1,Hank III has done nothing but prove what a whiner he is by trashing other artists.  I have not heard one song on here that suggests any artistic ability.  This guy needs to clean up his mouth and worry about himself instead of trashing others
2,"Because I like faster music with a beat that makes me tap a foot, I only liked the cut ""Lucky To Know You.""  ""Seeing Through You"" is all right, too.  Perhaps Reynolds will independently release a CD of his own with more songs like ""Lucky To Know You."" "
4,"Be Human does not disappoint! It has sound quality mixed in with sound fx and acoustic and classical and when I say 4stars I mean it. When I say 5stars I usually mean a ten. Were I to do sound for a futuristic play I would feel gratified in using some of this. I think Yoko Kanno knows the Secret of Life and she shares her formula...with us, time-and-time again. I happened to be spoiled on her earlier works and always long for those type masterpieces; but if I had to choose american rhythm or Yoko Kanno, I would choose Yoko Kanno. I wonder if she's ever been nominated for a grammy? In my book she's world-class!As-I-said-before this cd does not disappoint and there are enough tracks on it to justify  four-stars. No worries here"
5,This is one of my favorite releases from Common. This chi town warrior crafted an underground release that will bring a vibrant smile to the hardcore hip hop head and even awaken the minds of some of the fake commercial rap artist lovers. Songs like I used to love h.e.r and ressurection start the classic album and take you on the road to classic chicago hip hop. Not only the lyrics are dope but also the beats and the hooks. This is a pivotal album that needs to be in everyone's collectio
1,This must be the record for quickest backslide I've ever seen.  He went from U Saved Me to a potty-mouthed melodramatic soap opera that has already gotten old. This all shows he wasn't sincere about his spirituality. All the praise and glorifying was just relief of being given a free pass for using the wrong thing as a urinal.  I admit I was intrigued and entertained with Trapped in the Closet; but the continuations are just getting more and more ridiculous. To continue to extend the installments until you eventually get to Chapter 100 (which seems to be his plan to hear him tell it) is unacceptable
2,"I have always liked R. Kelly's music.  When he produced ""Trapped in the Closet"", I thought it was a joke.  This is one of the stupidest, corniest, and blandest song I heard."
2,"Juvenile has been at the bottom and the top in his career.  He marinated on the underground until Cash Money exploded into the rap arena as well as mainstream radio in the mid-to-late 90s.  But then people got tired of hearing the same ole product that the label had to offer.  Even labelmates were getting sick of each other and the politics that was going down, leaving some to either depart or find other ways of getting their name out there.  B.G. went the independent route, holding on to a small fraction of the fans he had when he was a Hot Boy.  Turk followed suit, but soon found himself behind bars instead of spitting bars.  Juvenile found himself going the solo route, although he did briefly return in 2003 for Juve The Great.  Now with Atlantic, Juvi has some catching up to do with his newest release Reality Check.  ""Get Your Hustle On"" is the perfect track to start off the album because it shows that Juvenile knows what he needs to do to get ahead.  ""I Know You Know"" with Trey Songz is a good contender for the radio.  ""Around The Way"" is a song for the hood to know that he ain't never left and he doesn't plan to either.  ""Sets Go Up"" with Wacko is so-so, while his first single ""Rodeo"" is the millennium version of ""Back That [...] Up"" only with a more subdued approach.  Unfortunately the album takes a nosedive from there.  ""What's Happenin'"" is nothing to write home about, ""Loose Booty"" is another song devoted to the [...]-shaking community, and ""Break A Brick Down"" deliberately borrows a beat from another Cash Money track. ""Who's Ya Daddy"" is pointless, along with the annoying ""Keep Talkin'"" with Skip and Redd Eyezz and ""Why Not.""  Bun B makes another poor decision by collaborating on ""Rock Like That.""  The biggest shocker has to be ""Addicted"" with Brian McKnight making a dumb career move. Not only does Brian sing vulgar lyrics for the first time (and hopefully his last,) but Juvenile decides to talk his verses instead of rapping them (think Oran Juice Jones when he was cussing the chick out at the end of ""The Rain."")    There are a lot of other dreadful songs on Reality Check that I'm not even going to bother mentioning.  This has to be the worst disc that Juvenile has ever put together in recent memory.  With an occasional track here and there that is even tolerable, Reality Check is not something you want to cop unless you are his biggest fan and can't live with yourself if you don't buy the album.  One thing is for sure...Juvenile better consider a legitimate reality check if he wants to stay in the rap game for years to come. "
2,"There are a couple OK tracks on this disc but this is far and away NOT the same Lost Trailers that put out some of my favorite music of the past few years.  Gone are the well crafted, story like lyrics and any sound of Southern rock. Those great stories (Longfall, Pontchartrain, Love & War, West End, Dougherty County, Under FM Waves and SO many more) and great music (See above as well as Red Sun, Sitting on Top of the World and Down in the Valley) have been replaced by Gravy, Dixie Boy Special & I'm a Country Man and the same old radio friendly country sound you can hear from anyone.  The sad irony in this are the lyrics to Under FM Waves (from New Age Cowboy) and how they talk about how much great music resides off radio--and look at what has happened: songs to created to make it on radio (which granted, should make them big).  Try their other 3 available cd's (Story of the New Age Cowboy, Trailer Trash and Welcome to the Woods). They have some other very hard to find music out there but these 3 should be available (Trailer Trash is a mix of songs from Rock Band, songs that ended up on Welcome, etc).  P.S. to the last review--Ryder Lee is the lead vocalist. Geoffrey Stokes Neilson is the guitarist and lead songwriter. "
1,"BE doesn't live up to the hype?  Whoever wrote that editorial needs to be punished. The court jester doesn't deserve to live.  Not only does BE live up to the hype; BE is the hype.  Common and Kanye reminiscent of Quincy and Michael, the early years.  When Michael was still black and male.  Simply stated, BE flows.  If BE were any tighter we couldn't afford it.  No need to skip or go back. Just enuff songs to make you listen to it again.  Great work of art.  Common and Kanye - damn!!!!"
1,"I read recently that Sheryl Crow's song ""Good is Good"" a song from her new album, was nominated for a Grammy award. Seriously,how much time and effort could it possibly take to come up with that. TNMC, also won a Grammy when it was released. I still can not understand why, but I do have a theory. Simply put, the music industry is more interested in image than musical talent and integrity. While only a mediocre talent at best,Sheryl Crow is deified. I realize that this is only my opinion(and I have a right to state it) this type of music nauseates me. There is so much music throughout the world to be explored and appreciated. Do not let some in the music industry to bombard and assault you with this type of musical drek. I do have a solution: all the record producers and industry personnel responsible for the above-mentioned ""crimes"" should all be sentenced to a jail term for however long it takes them to recognize true talent and get some ""SOUL."" Peace"
1,"And folk revivalism is what it is, folks; I'll label it even if the populists fume at me because I know of more than 5 genres.  Meloy admits in interview after interview his taste for the Fairport Convention, Pentangle, and above all Shirely Collins.  He even did an album of ""covers"" of Shirley Collins' arrangements of British traditionals, a ridiculous concept if I ever heard of one.  Why cover another singer's versions of TRADITIONAL songs?  This idiocy should evince Meloy's alienation from a long tradition of reinterpretations of British folk music, and indeed most of his oeuvre consists of feeble attempts at ballad composition.  With no prosodic skill, he goes about constructing narratives modeled on such work as Shirley Collins' repertoire.  Evidently Meloy believes he can pen ballads as if he were a Walter Scott, S.T.C. or John Keats, but his weak stories show throughout the imaginative poverty of an American desperately attempting to beat an escape to the land of faerie.  The wistfulness and Romantic nostalgia of Meloy's work come off as trite and calculated for NPR yuppies.  Moreover, his vocal range consists entirely of yelp, melancholy warble and nasal whine--this whingeing troubadour sounds as if he constantly has a cold.  I'll admit the band is at least competent, but do yourself a favor: buy Comus' ""First Utterance,"" the Incredible String Band's ""The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter"" or Shirley Collins' ""No Roses"" instead"
5,"This album showcases Collin Raye's amazing tenor to the fullest. Hits like ""Love Me,"" ""Little Rock,"" ""My Kind of Girl,"" ""Not That Different,"" and ""I Can Still Feel You"" are featured on this brilliant album. Raye's vocals are well done, as is the song selection. Most of the songs are ballads, Raye's specialty. If you are a fan of Collin Raye, then this album is a must-have."
1,"I'm sorry but children that try to rap are just horrible. They are just a gimmick like the old school r and b artists that would come out called teeny boppers. I guess this lil one wants to be a ""hip hop teeny bopper"". Well guess what? You don't get teeny bopper reviews, you get grown up one's. Please stop rapping and go to college (or work as a mechanic) like a normal kid should"
5,"Though Dylan and the Band had played together a lot before this record (the Basement tapes and the 1967 tour), this is the first recording of them together that was released and I must say the Band's playing on this record is vastly different than those times, different than the live ""Before the Flood"" as well. I get almost a lose, playful feeling from them here, driven by Garth's excellent keyboards and Robbie's stunning guitar work. Love songs, dirges, uplifting songs, tough songs and torch songs, this is a record for the ages. Yes, it was overshadowed by ""Blood on the Tracks,"" but it's been years now and still ""Planet Waves"" stands the test of time. I really like this record"
1,"Believe it or not, I had actually expected to hate this because it just doesn't suit me for the good kind of music. It sounds just the way I thought it would sound: crappy. It isn't hard enough to be all that good if you ask me. It is just too calm. {And now you probably think I'm a hypocrite because I like Enya}. At least Enya doesn't sound like someone who sounds like they are in a garage band attempting to record bad music. Not my style."
1,"Sorry, I thought this would be a great updated version of the classic SHR music - and I was really disappointed. I don't really understand the point of this album - why ""remake"" music that was timeless and pretty much perfect in the first place?  I can't imagine my own kids actually learning anything from these remakes (and bottom line, wasn't that the point?)... and listening to ""No More Kings"" was downright depressing - when SHR has always had the exact-opposite effect!"
1,"Now I have heard a lot of people say that this is a classic, and that it may be the most creative CD of all time, but when I take a listen, I just laugh. There are so many better rappers who have a million times the talent that Missy Elliot has and are so much more creative. Honestly, and the lyrics are awful, only a couple of the beats are okay, but after listening to Missy Elliot's annoying voice, then you will be very frustrated like I was that I bought this"
1,"What a thought provoking and creative album title.I wonder how long it took her to come up with that name?I cant believe the trendy garbage people listen to these days.All the songs sound the same and have the same pointless lyrics to them.She cant produce,rap write or do much of anything of value.I saw this trash at tower records and it was just collecting dust.Save your money and dont buy any of her worthless junk ever again.Listen to some real artists like black sabbath,judas priest or iron maiden.Dont forget to vote for my review"
5,"If you are looking for just a general overview of Iggy's career, I'd say this is a pretty good way to go.  It contains a bit of music from each section of his career"
5,"This motion picture soundtrack is the best! That`s my opinion anyway; the movie (National Treasure - Starring: Nicolas Cage) has been one of my top favorites ever since it came out. I also recommend the ""Titanic"" soundtrack as well if you are interested in this one. And if you have doubts as to whether or not to buy this CD, try listening to the clips. My personal favorite is: ""National Treasure Suite"" (Track 1). The Tracks: ""Library of Congress"" (Track 4), and ""Declaration of Independence"" (Track 2) are nice slower ones. Track: ""Spectacle Discovery"" (Track 10) is another one of my favorites also. Some of the tracks on this CD can be a little repetitive, but all in all, I think this CD is worth the money"
5,This CD is a must have if you are a Hot Boys (Old school Cash Money) fan
2,"...don't buy this CD.  Most of this is emo, and quite a bit of it is meandering and not particularly catchy.  There are a few good bands on this CD--enough to merit maybe listening to it once or twice, but it's not worth your time if you're an actual punk fan.  It has an interesting mix of music, but it doesn't fit together too well.  The upsides to this compilation are as follows:  one, the Dropkick Murphys song, and two, it's inexpensive.  However, it's even less expensive to just forget about buying this CD at all"
1,How can they even call this punk. Were's six feet under or slayer. Maybe some cibo matto. These are the bands they need to add....... Not yellowcard and other crummy emo band
2,"RBX is one of my favorite rappers, he has a dark, sinister style. Instead of dropping a unique, straight hip hop album(which is what I was expecting). He decided to make a g-funk album co-starring his whole muthaf@$#ing family.This is more of a compilation because RBX only does a small handfull of songs solo, and predictably, those ones are basicly the best tracks with the exception of the snoop and daz collabos. So RBX I ask you, why would you try to make an album featuring mostly talentless artists on your record label, when you could have done a REAL DOPE solo album (how do I miss Heatmizer) and package a compilation of your artists with the album? I could not be more disappointed. I would rather spend my 11.99 on anything but this cd, Sorry X, you wasted your talent on this album, dont be mad at me"
4,"Seth Maheu ""College Student""....your high. remedy is probably the song i like LEAST on this album. i hate it. the rest of the songs are awesome though, my favs are ""because of me"" ""world falls away"" ""tongue"" and ""simplest mistake"". this cd is a solid effort.  and seth, you know Ef all about music. the fact u like remedy the best, and suggested that anything by lloyd banks is worth buying shows you have terrible taste. Jurrassic 5 are good, but ""amazing lyricism""?? no. jurrasic 5 are good because they are fun, and keep the forumla simple and old school. true hip hop. but there are LEGIONS of more talented emcees.   dont EVER say anything about lloyd banks again. he is terrible and makes outdated, gangster BS. he should get over himself and stop furthering the stereotypes everyone has of hip-hop. hip-hop has a terrible name becuase of losers like him, 50, ja, and eminem (yeah he USED to be good).  BUY THIS SEETHER ALBUM"
1,I am only in my 20's but I did grow up listening to the original album of A Chorus Line (my mom used to play it while we were cleaning) and I gotta say that this remake is awful.  The original cast had great passion in their voices and the new cast is very blah.  I don't recomend this at all.  If you really love and appreciate the music find a copy of the orginal and I know that you will enjoy it much better
2,"There are several questions I have after listening to this CD.  Why are the tempos so crazy?  The opening number plods along like a funeral march, while At The Ballet zips past as if the performers are on crank.  Part of me suspects that cast is performing against a pre-recorded accompaniment track.  Why does everything sound so thin?  These orchestrations were created to achieve maximum resonance in live acoustic settings.  On this CD, it's like every single instrument is separately mic'ed and mixed to within an inch of its life, sometimes to the detriment of the overall sound.  Sometimes, obviously live instruments sound like MIDI.  Usually it's the sound engineer's job to make the opposite happen!  Why are the vocals so ""hot""?  In the OBC, there were occasions when the entire chorus would get overwhelmed by reverb and full-sounding orchestra.  Now it's the vocals that tear at the balance.  Who cast this show?  I'm not going to single any one cast member out because it would rude, but -- oh screw it.  You deserve to know.  This Cassie is some serious vocal ugly.  I didn't once wonder along with Zach why she was stuck auditioning on the line, like I did with Ms. Donna McKechnie's fabulous triple threat.  Why not update some of the orchestrations?  I have a deep and abiding respect for Jonathan Tunick (who is among my top three favorite Broadway creative types), but it's 2006.  Wah wah pedals are out.  Overall, although this CD is good for completists, it's not going to knock the OBC recording out of it's slot as the definitive A CHORUS LINE recording.  If you don't have a Chorus Line CD and are trying to decide which one to buy, track down the re-mastered version of the original broadway cast.  It's vintage, but it has a raw warmth that is missing from the revival cast"
2,"That moron who said their music hasent changed is so dumb and obviousley not a true SOAD fan. Ive been a SOAD fan since they were just a small band with loads of potential. SOAD was a great album and Toxicity was sweet and Steal This Album was really a great musical adventure but this album just isnt SOAD at all. Ok in all fairness if I was writing this review and this was their debut album great album overall reallly a 4.5/5 truthfully. But compared to their earlier work this just doenst cut it, their older stuff was way way better then this crap. And Daron should stop trying to get so much singing time in he really isnt that good of a singer and Serj is much better"
5,"Absolutely great collection of Alan Jackson's best, without the filler.  A must-have.  By the way, is everyone laughing yet at the 9/2/01 reviewer who suggested that Alan Jackson's ""songwriting skills need work""?!"
4,"In 1987 Barry, Robin, and Maurice were reunited! Or at least that's how new distributor Warner Brothers tried to sell it.  Even though the brothers never really left themselves or us, but  I digress.  I only have this album on cdr, since Warner's seemed to make the release very scarce.  The cover is cool, though.  The boys look totally different from when audiences remembered them last. No white, no hair, well not as much anyway.  Black. Dark, edgy.  I'm Pip and I've come to play!          ESP is naturally the song to lead off the album.  It is different from any other project the Brothers did at the time.  Better than Walls Have Eyes, more polished than Now Voyager.  However, ESP is also very stand alone on this album and nothing else here sounds like it.  (Not that I mind that of course.)  We heard some of Robin's coming out voice party on Living Eyes, but in songs shared with Baz.  Barry moved onto some heavy producing, but without Robin.  ESP brings them together again and slams both powerhouses.  There is so much going on in this song, you can imagine this is what a telepath hears. Noise, each trying to have its own say, competing with everything else that is heard, and all of it's important.  Brilliant.          Ah, You Win Again.  Although not as well know in the US as the Fever Monsters, this song is indeed one of those monster songs that you just have to love.  There are so many hooks, lines, and sinkers musically, lyrically, vocally. From the whole second verse's play on `Nobody stops this body' to Robin's Oh Baby! wail to that bombing drum throughout.  Hot damn.  This song did actually even encroach the US charts, imagine that!         Live Or Die (Hold Me Like A Child)  (What is it with them and parenthesis?) is the first slow song presented.  Barry returns to his shrill notes and sometimes the versus are tough to understand.  The chorus is strong and the lyrics as always are top notch.  The ad-libbed over the top ending is perfect eighties power ballad fashion.  The music and high voices are a little dated, but you can't help but try and sing along when your driving home alone late at night, or is that just me?          Giving Up The Ghost  sound a bit more like the tracks on Walls Have Eyes, but that's ok. Great music rifts.  Some of the refrains are a bit much, and one of the times where I might say the chorus is the weaker part of the song. Then again, the boys hold out `Ghooooost!' and it sounds cool again.  Robin sounds great in the verses, since you can understand him seventy percent of the time.  ;0)        The Longest Night is one of the hotter Bee Gees songs in my opinion, just like Bodyguard.  After their solo and side projects in the early eighties, the brothers came back for ESP stronger again.  Robin with this song has somehow managed to combine the weeping Joke sound with the booming voice he developed post Fever.  The vibrato was always there, but the five o'clock shadow eighties sounds fit Robin's haunting lyrics as the sixties mellow sound did.   Indeed ESP together with Walls Have Eyes is a dang good hunk of Gibb material that it seems everyone missed. Pity.          Every album has to have a fun song and This Is Your Life is ESP's.   It's nice to see the Brothers come back and kind of laugh off and yet embrace their past music.  The lyrics `line-drop' titles of other Bee Gees songs during the interlude.  Can I tell you this is the only time I sing to `JJJive Talkin'!  It's Barry rapping but with dribs and drabs from the old songs cutting in and out. Very cool.  I could recommend the entire album on that interlude alone if I had to, but I don't.         Outside of its sweet and soft lyrics and vocals, Angela  is in my mind a little bit of a statement song.   Sometimes it feels like you can almost exchange `Angela' for `America'.  Followed by the line `I'm still alive', I wonder if the boys were making a veiled statement at us stubborn Yanks.  Indeed they were still alive, and maybe this is also a pun on Stayin' Alive. The New York times effect a man, remember.  ;0)  The feel of the song is so innocent and easy feeling, but I suspect more!  The girl that got away? I think not.          Maurice brings this album to a standstill with Overnight.  It's the closest in vein to the song ESP.  Maurice, however, adds not telepathy, but animal magnetism.  It's a different kind of psychic sense.  The lyrics  are so detailed and the interlude combining the echo of all three voices is exceptional.  The music has, if there is such a thing, a predatory feeling that's good.  By the end of the song you are totally sold and yelling back, ""All right I'll stay!""         In the eighties and later on High Civilization, The Brothers seem to have a little Motown tribute revival thing going. Crazy For Your Love is fascinating in that it is has a Motown throwback vibe and at the same time, it's straight eighties bubblegum pop.  (Tiffany, anyone?)  I would cringe if I heard some tween today singing any song about love and ice cream .  However, play Crazy for a kid today, they will like it, and never know it is old men singing in 1987!  How ingenious is it to find such a timeless song here?!         Backtafunk  is not your traditional Gibb song.  It sounds a bit...I want to say New Edition! Naturally the brothers master all the hip beats and singing, even if the lyrics are slightly bland.  Again however, the breakaway interlude makes the song.  The harmony and fun of the boys come in and the song kicks up to another level.  Is Barry scatting? Incredible!         ESP ends with the ESP Vocal Reprise, and I don't really know why.  Its  just the opening echo of the voices on the first track, but it does sound cool. Allow me to mention the oddities associated with ESP, as you knew there would be some! Young Love is an unreleased cut that didn't make the album.  I managed to download a piece that cuts short, but it's heavy in the low key Maurice vein.  Honestly I don't know why it was cut.  The 1989 compilation Tales From The Brothers Gibb contains an ESP Demo that is very similar to the final version, just missing a few production marks.  Fans should also check out The One For All Tour VHS and DVD for concert footage of the boys singing Giving Up The Ghost and extras from One.          Warner Brothers does not realize The Bee Gees quality they possess, and they should re-release ESP.  I wonder if this album planned to have any sort of theme to it? Each song touches a different type of emotion and vibe, and aren't songs in a way a psychic connection from one person to another? Interesting theory, Kristin. Interesting. "
1,"Hooba...stank...stinks and will always stink. I don't know about the rest of the CD, but listening to The Reason is about as pleasant as sticking your hand into a running garbage disposal.  I'm not a perfect perrrrsssonn. Egad"
1,"I was just speechless when i first heard this. What was known as the best heavy metal band on earth 10 years prior, has become a lion without balls or teeth. Country-influenced tunes!? Slow, blues-influenced songs? NO way, NO thanks.  Also a very overrated album. The Black Album was OKAY but 3 stars in my book..but man this was a sharp right turn for them and the beginning of the end for Metallica.PS: The Memory Remains and Unforgiven 2 are HORRIBLE SONGS."
5,"These guys are the best group out right now. Every single rapper is AMAZING even Bizarre who is not great so far as flow but probably has the funniest lyrics. This album brought me some of my favorite songs to date including Sh*t Can Happen, Pistol Pistol, Ain't Nuttin' But Music, American Psycho, Fight Music & Revelation. My favorite rappers are Swifty & Eminem but the fact is every one should have a solo album out by now (besides Em, only Proof (R.I.P.) & Bizarre do... which are my least favorite rappers in the group) Every song is great even the skits are enjoyable. If you don't have this yet, you are missing out on one of the best cds ever"
5,"OK...there may be alot of songs on here that you don't know from her Hollywood films, but don't let that stop you.  She is marvelous and fun!  Another reviewer said they were disappointed with this...ignore them and buy it"
5,"The music in this musical uncannily remains faithful to ABBA music and the story line which was written to showcase the music.  I saw the Las Vegas production, not the the original London production yet the music sung and played in the LV production was just as fantastic as that within the original production. If you like ABBA,(and who does not?) and cannot spring for the price of a ticket, this DVD is the next best thing"
5,My only regret was not getting this album sooner.  The music and lyrics are real and unpretentious.  Wayne Hancock is a true American gem
1,"let's just get this out of the way now. maysa? i'm on your team babes, but this cd just hasn't done it for me. i got your 1st cd & was hooked. i waited for the next & was floored! not in a good way! the cd jacket was so drab & tired, just like damn near every song inside the case. i let it sit on my shelf & decided to give it a listen again. still i didn't feel it. it's in my car right now & i still can't get through it all. i'm still on your team though. i have your latest & i play it 2 death. over & over. cd's 1 & 3 are both must haves. but this 1 stinks"
2,"Jerry, si estas leyendo esto: Creo que todos estamos de acuerdo en decir que eres un cantante excepcional. Te queremos mucho!!!  Pero queremos que vuelvas a cantar salsa, como la del tiempo de ""Cuenta Conmigo"", ""Cara de Nino"", y ""Magia""...  No te dejes influenciar por la musica que esta de moda hoy, el reggaeton no te va!!! No me malinterpretes: hasta tu disco ""Vuela muy alto"" me encanto, pero creo que ahora es tiempo de volver a la musica que mejor te queda. Seguire escuchando tus discos de salsa anteriores hasta que vuelvas a sacar uno nuevo.  Vamos, por favor, te lo rogamos!!! Te quiere tu fan DJ LOLA, desde Montreal, Canada"
5,"""The Who Sell Out"" is one among ( at least 3 ) several Who master pieces. With its build up as a commercial radio station program with commercials in between the songs and overall great songwriting, the album may very well be the most varied and most entertaining Who album.  1967 was a year of psychedelia in rock music and the Who were among the pioneers of that trend. This is obvious from the first track of the album ""Armenia in the Sky"". The outstanding single ""I Can See For Miles"" is among the very best psychelia songs recorded.   The acoustic ""Mary Anne With the Shaky Hand"" is another Who favourite - beautiful melody, great rhythm and intelligent lyrics.  Actually the lyrics are overall great on this album  - with wit and homour.  Songs like ""Odorono"" and ""Tattoo"" are rarely included on Who compilations - and they're both bound to be great positive surprises to the first-time listener of the album.   ""Our Love Was"" and ""I Can't Reach"" are other fine tracks - both more in the style of their previous album ""A Quick One"".   I might be expected that the short commercials ( most of them musically done ) would be annoying after the first couple listens - but this is really not the case. These short tracks works great in the context of the album.   Only the final two tracks of the original album seem a little out of place. Townshend's acoustic ""Sunrise"" is quite beautiful, but ""Rael"" feels somewhat longwinded and dated.  Most of the bonus-tracks are great - most of the apparently were only left out due to lack of space on the vinyl format.   Try to shuffle the tracks - the bonus-tracks really fit in nicely with the originals."
5,"This album demonstrates the musical mastery of the legendary Who. It's also interesting how today's groups like Green Day and Limp Bizkit don't even close to the Who. And to Orion, a reviewer on this forum, you're a sad case, my friend. I sincerely hope that you successfully seek out the psychological help that you so desperately are in need of"
1,"The Who don't have any talent. They are overrated, and only made 1 decent song in Wont Get Fooled Again. Avoid this lousy compilation and get Dire Straits Making Movies insted"
4,"I was introduced to MCR through Three cheers for sweet revenge, which is one of the best albums to ever be released. I brought you my bullets, you brought me your love is a very, very good release. All the songs are awesome, and the intensity and ferocity that drew me MCR in the first place is well in place on this album. But, it seems that they were still finding their sound and direction on this album. Very good album, but the recording is very raw, semi-okay production. But nevertheless a great release that you must check out...My favorite song is Drowning lessons"
1,how all yall fools gonna come up in here calling this trash gangsta.. Kali is where the real ridas live and die notthe dirty.. DIRTY... south or the LEAST coast.. everyone since the mid 90's has bitten the west coast and this is no exception.. tha frontlinerz have a track called ''gangsta in me'' and they put it right on these so-called gangsta's callin themselves trap ni66az.. this is a joke.. like everything else and whoever said this isnt commercial.. give it up.. this record is sitting on wal-marts shelves!!! i heard this and had one serious laugh.. boyz n da hood... another example of how you suckers bite the west..
4,"Few people are aware that Dave Thomas, in addition to being the founder and spokesman of the Wendy's hamburger chain, was also the leader of Pere Ubu. Clearly Mr. Thomas wasn't in it for the money, since he made his fortune selling good old-fashioned hamburgers, and so he was free to pursue his own musical muse. The results are sometimes splendid, sometimes things go awry, but it's always the unique stylings of Dave Thomas that characterize this raw, passionate music. Kinda makes you wonder what would have happened if Carl Karcher, founder of Carl's Junior, had also pursued music with such abandon and freedom from financial considerations"
1,"It sucks big time!!!!!!! Alot of this was experienced in my ears those first few months in Hell...I mean Florida. The first song I heard from this was ""Today"", and I thought it was good the first time I heard it as it was only a 30 second snipet that I heard, but then when I heard the entire song it was depressing, and then there was ""Disarm"" which I hated from day one, and the same with ""Cherub Rock"". I just felt like I shouldn't have even bought this at this particular time in my life, but I guess I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt. However, with one song barely tolerable which is ""Mayonaise"" I'm ready to dismiss this as one of the worst of the 90's"
1,"This CD is a total misrepresentation.  MANY of the songs are VERY poorly done concert versions of songs.  They even use the exact same audience cheering track on several songs.  Buy it only if you are a fan looking to fill in missing songs in your collection.  Don't buy it thinking you are getting all the original hits.  14 songs are live.  One appears to be re-recorded.  The rest are the originals.  Also, on CD #2 many of the media tags are incorrect.  When you play ""All I Really Need Is You"" (Live) the title ""Heartbreak Hotel"" shows.  When you play ""Headed for the Future"" the song title ""All I Really Need Is You"" shows.  When you play ""Heartbreak Hotel"" the song title ""Headed for the Future"" shows.  Overall, a VERY sloppy project they obviously just rushed to market not caring about quality"
2,"As a well-educated rock music,especially emo-punk,person,I was sickened every time i tried to listen to this CD all the way through.Why? It's definitely one of the less-than-great emo albums ever (not completely horrible,though)and the fact that this band is led by a singer who shouldn't be bragging about his ""musical genius"" when he should first realize how disgusting his voice sounds compared to most other emo singers,isn't sweetening the deal.When i bought this album,it had a sticker on it that read:""If you like Taking Back Sunday,Brand New and The Used,you'll love Matchbook Romance!""I should have known how desperate they were when i read that.But more disturbing is the fact that they dared compared themselves to Taking Back Sunday? TBS is actually an emo band that doesn't sound recicled.And Brand New?Have they heard Deja Entendu?That album is not only the best emo album,but definitely one of the best albums of all time-in any genre"
5,"I'm afraid Alfonso Lozada has missed the point. The film is about a span of time in the life of one person, Tony Wilson, and is thus structured around his experiences. At the same time, the film is not a documentary but a fictionalized account. On top of all this, the &quot;Tony&quot; character does mention the short shrift the Stone Roses get. Is it really a surprise to find the soundtrack album bereft of artists which did not appear in the film"
4,"For me, there have always been those bands where I like them but can only listen to a few of the songs because of the lead singers voice. This would include Maroon 5, Billy Talent, and Clap Your Hands Say Yea. While I applaud these bands for being unique, it is hard to listen to an entire cd of it. Hot Hot Heat is one of the only exceptions I have ever had. I can listen to their cd's over and over and not have to stop after the 3rd or 4th track. While anything can become irritating, it takes Hot Hot Heat quite a while to get to me. I am also not a huge fan of these new English bands like Snow Patrol and Arctic Monkeys, but yet again Hot Hot Heat has something that just sticks with me. I recommend this cd as well as Make Up The Breakdown. Very good, upbeat songs that you will enjoy full-heartedly on a car ride home"
5,This is the best R&B female album out this year. I listen to this CD all day. Although it has 10 songs like the other chick... Monica has something to say and relates to many women out there. I love this CD. My favorite is Hell No. If you have not done so go and get this immediatley especially if you wasted your money on BDay like I did
5,"Well Crossfade may just be another modern rock Alt Metal band but that doesn't make them bad. Sure, they don't really add anything new to the music out now but that shouldn't take away from the music itself. All I know is from what I heard they have some really good tracks. I first heard the track ""Cold"" on the radio and it was just one of those songs that I love instantly. I just had to go out and get the album. After getting the album It turned out to be pretty good. I pretty much enjoyed everything on here. Although, my favorite tracks would have to be ""Cold"", ""Starless"", ""Colors"", and ""Dead Skin"". Here's the track ratings...  1. Starless - 9.5/10  2. Cold - 10/10  3. So Far Away - 9.5/10  4. Colors - 10/10  5. Death Trend Setta - 10/10   6. The Deep End - 9/10 7. No Giving Up - 9.5/10 8. Dead Skin - 10/10 9. Disco - 7/10  10. The Unknown - 9/10  Overall: 93% A-  Sure, it's not really anything new but It is good and a nice listen. I enjoyed this album very much and am very curious to see what Crossfade has done with their new album that was just released. Anyway, anyone who's into this style of music will probably end up finding a bunch of other good tracks for their music collection. "
4,"Out of Exile, like the debut, rocks out of the blocks riding a rolling riff that once again confirms that these guys are actually steeped in classic hard rock folklore. Again we see Rick Rubin twiddling the knobs for a fine selection of mature hard rock. Chris Cornell is again in full possession of a voice capable of putting all sorts of feeling into his lyrics. Indeed the fact that Cornell writes all the lyrics is interesting - the fact that this band has had to work out how to operate after their still talked about former bands was another hurdle these dudes had to get over. Lucky for us that they did.  This second instalment of the Audioslave story sounds much like the first which is no bad thing. The riffs are so smooth - who let the 70's back in? - and the band show full well the way to alternate rockers with mellower stuff. This album does fell a little mellower overall. Not sure if that's why the album flopped to a certain extent in certain territories but the band have corrected the slight problem of too many tracks that affected the debut.  This ablum probably shut some of the naysayers up. Sure it's sales weren't up there with the debut but it's as consistent as the first album and it's showed that this band were a serious proposition and not just a one off project and that's a good thing as hard rock needs such gimmick free bands in the mix as a foil to some of the more hysterical bands out there. In the final analysis this is a four star release for those who like their hard rock from talented players and full off rollicking riffs for the melodies to ride along.  Token non musical gripe - why the dull/crap cover"
5,"The movie is awesome, but the cd is equally amazing.  Awe-inspiring, from quiet, peaceful music to the full orchestra in the finale at the end, this is one of the best soundtracks ever written!  A great gift to yourself or friends"
2,"I absolutely loved that song ""Carry On Wayward Son"" which sounds like one of the greatest stuff in history. Rest of the other songs on this album are not that good. 2-stars"
4,"This is a somewhat interesting exploration of language, semantics and rhythm.  It is more surreal in it's use of deconstructed conversations placed with new and different contexts.  Some of it reminds one greatly of Korean Samul-nori music, which relies mostly upon percussion and rhythm that is based upon the Korean language (listen to No. 6, ""An Animated Description of Mr. Maps"" for a very clear example of such.  While some tracks are very ingaging and suggest a different musical line of exploration from much conventional music, there is a problematic sameness in instrumentation that is sometimes very uninteresting due to a lack of musical development. The Books could end up doing very well if they were to invest more time in their musical development of their ideas and instrumentation.  Layering samples can only go so far before it is boring"
1,"Knopfler has once again fallen far short of the promise inherent in those long ago days of Dire Straits. Perhaps he is attempting to be Mr. Atkins reincarnate, but if that is the case then he should  buy the white shoes and move to Florida. Simply put, a terrible album with little to recommend it."
1,"I feel sorry for those who thought this was more great YES-Jon Anderson Christmas music.  I'm one of the few fortunate souls who actually found a 3 Ships CD after it was out of print.  Paid some $30+ for it, but worth every penny.  Too bad ripping and passing out mp3's is illegal, because I'd share!  Add my name to the ""Bring Back 3 Ships!"" petition"
5,"On What's Left of Me, Nick Lachey sings about lost love and heartbreak for they whole duration of the CD.  This is his version of No Doubt's Tragic Kingdom CD.  Every song is about a broken relationship.  The Lyrics are very good and the songs are also very well done.  Don't buy this CD if you are looking for his SoulO upbeat fluff.  The tone of this CD is sad.  Most of the songs are ballads.  But not slow ballads more like pop rock power ballads.  He has a great voice.  It is strong and has a great tone.  Out of every boy-bander I have ever heard I would say he has the most talent.  Not only is his voice strong but it is also great because he sounds like a man not a girl, (i.e. Justin Timberlake).  The stand out tracks are: I Can't Hate You Anymore, On Your Own, and Beautiful.  The rest of the songs are good too.  This CD finally makes him a legitimate music star"
2,"I recieved this CD as a present, not thinking much about it since its southern rap  This CD has almost no lyrical talent  The reason I gave it 2 stars, is because I enjoyed the production of some songs that were done by the Neptunes.  Like almost all southern rap now, its got heavy bass but no lyrical talent.  So if your one of those clueless kids that like rap (mainstream rap) I would say you could possible enjoy this cd"
1,"The show rocks, the soundtrack sucks. I didn't recognize any of the songs from the show, that alone tells you how memorable this soundtrack is. Dismal and dissapointing :"
1,"I liked the first album and I won't pretend to be an aficionado of this genre, but some things I have learned:  1) Don't rap with a touch of laryngitis 2) Maybe sing/rap with the beat and not just near it 3) Drop the ""my life sucks"" and ""everyone hates me"" tracks - whoops that is the entire album 4) I don't think the world can stand more than one rapped sad piano ballad 5) If every background singer has a better voice, perhaps your are done  Anyone want to buy a used CD"
2,"Kate Bush's second album, ""Lionheart"", may be the weakest in her catalog.  Its clear Bush did not want to fall into the trap of constructing ""The Kick Inside Part Two"", and instead reaches in a number of different directions, some successful, some less so.  Musically, the album takes stabs at ballads similar to the first record (""In Search of Peter Pan"", ""In the Warm Room""), a more pop structure (""Wow""), rhythmic shifts (""Don't Put Your Foot on the Heartbrake"") an almost shuffle (""Fullhouse"") and a gret rock song (""Hammer Horror"").  Lyrically, Bush has added a level of sensuality to her work (""Symphony in Blue"") and shows no sign of shying away from controversial subjects (""Kashka from Baghdad"").  The problem is that it doesn't hang together well to my mind-- admittedly, my rating for the album is in many ways relative to Bush's other work, no album with the absolutelyu amazing ""Kashka from Baghdad"" can be all that bad, and certainly ""Symphony in Blue"" is strong enough to stop you in your tracks, but the album just doesn't work for me.  For early Bush, try her debut (""The Kick Inside"") or the stunning ""Never For Ever"""
2,"this CD is not good.  Luckily, I only paid 5 bucks for the used copy.  I mean do we really want to hear incomplete songs?  I don't.  The couple of actual completed songs are pretty good so it gets 2 stars as opposed to the one star it probably deserves.  Bruce really took a page from Gene's book here and went after the money.  Should be an EP and nothing more"
2,"This cd just doesnt sound good which means it was poorly produced. Any 1999 cd should have better sound quality. Like the other reviewers stated,i too found it dissapointing that the wrestlers theme songs were approximately 1 minute long each.Gotta hit the repeat button to enjoy them a little longer. They could have been longer and the cd could have done without the irrelevant remarks made here and there by the commentators. Curiously too,where is the NWO's music"
1,"Painful to hear and painful to watch.  A yester-year pop singer who doesn't have the courage to quit.  There is nothing left to do so she keeps throwing out pointless album after pointless album to stay in the spotlight; if that isn't the highest form of egoism I don't know what is.  She's got fame she's got fortune she had her hits why not just go now please?  What she use to do for shock value in the early days now seems so trite and pathetic.  The woman is nothing more then a spectacle with very little substance.  She uses anything from sex to religion to self promote.  Yes I was a fan in the days of Like a prayer and Vogue but I have moved on, why Madonna doesn't come to the same conclusion I will never understand.  This CD is good for the flavor of the month but its shelf life is way past due.  I challenge Madonna to put on a concert without all the antics and overt sexual malarkey that dominates her shows; she would be booed right off the stage if that were to happen.  And please enough with the crucifixion stunts all ready.  "
4,This album is what the goo is all about.......they were at their BEST here!!!!!!!!!!  This was the classic album they will never ever be able to pruduce again
1,"Nelly's sophomore album was just as bad as his first one. The song Hot In Herre was a decent lead off single, so I thought that he might have came to his senses a little bit. Boy was I wrong. More singing and this time with Kelly Rowland from Destiny's Child on the song Delimma and a song with Justin Timberlake. Now he makes a somewhat attempt to impress me by taking Beanie Siegel's Roc Tha Mic (Remix) and puts it on his CD, not to mention taking a shot a hip hop legend KRS-One. Another track worth listening to is #1 and possibly the only song that he has made by himself worth listening to. Everything else, just a big no no. Once again he has appealed himself to the people who hardly listening to rap, because I even hear that song with Kelly Rowland on oldies radio stations. This right here has got to stop, because I had enough of it."
5,"Bob is the King!  The KING!  Get this disc, you will dig it.  You can really sense the urgency in this CD.  Go to Bob's site, check out some of his notes on the Album.  If you can make to Austin, TX, spend about 2 weeks going to Bob's shows and you will understand.  From Joe Rockhead to Texas Bluegrass Masacre, Bob's the real deal, always pushing boundries, coming up with new sounds, un-corporate, straight ahead Rock and Roll"
5,"I'm trying to get everything he ever did, a real her"
5,Don''t waste anymore time in reading reviews.  Go and get this album
1,"I'm not the biggest fan of Springsteen, but I have liked a lot of what he's done in the past. I wasted my money on this one. It sounds like uninspired mumbling. Not much musical or vocal variation at all among the songs. Nothing stands out. No experimentation. There might be some good story lines in the songs, but I usually can't understand him anyway. I liked two songs, but not enough to get the album out and turn it on. I never desire to play it after a few listenings. So beware, unless your a huge fan and want all his music, this one may let you down."
1,"bought this cd quite a while ago. it is probably very good, but how can i tell when it won't play on my stereo? this dual disc format is the music industries way of screwing long time fans. this sticking it to the fan is about as low as it gets. after buying the disc, i noticed the tiny warning on the back that says ""audio side of disc does not conform to cd specifications and therefor not all cd players will play the audio side of this disc."" WHAT A GREAT IDEA: SELL A DISC TO PEOPLE THAT WON'T PLAY FOR EVERYBODY. THANKS A..HOLES"
5,"I AM A TRUE SMOOTH JAZZ FAN AND I HAVE TO SAY THIS IS THE BEST CD BRIAN HAS EVER MADE."" COME ON UP "" IS GOOD BUT ""NICE AND SLOW"" IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS.LISTEN ONE TIME AND YOU WILL BE HOOKED I KNOW I WAS.                                   "
5,Nicholas Reyes has the absolutely perfect voice for this music...a fantastic collection of energetic rhythms to  keep you moving!!  
1,For a group that exudes such passion in their music (LIVE FROM BUFFALO anybody?) this song is like a funeral dirge. I can only hope that they haven't released the full album because they are trying to rekindle the passion that has made them the fan-favorite that they are.  Take your time guys - let's get your BEST work.   T
5,"I rated this album 5 stars because it wouldn't let me do a 4.9 star. 3:16 was the perfect LP. This is very close. There is no one song that stands out like there was on 3:16 with, Walk Like A Man, but still, the cd is one of the best yet.  Let me say this, I have 3 Murs CDs, The end of the beginning, 3:16, and now Murray's Revenge. This is the second best of the 3. Track 6, Dreamchaser, is definately worth putting on repeat all day. That is my favorite song on the cd.  All of the tracks on here are solid.   For someone trying to get a feel for Murs and his style, he uses a lot of samples in his beats like Kanye West, and his flow, well, hes in a league of his own. One of the best lyricists out there today and maybe of all time. He is not underground, but not big yet either. He deserves air time. His tracks aren't aimed for that like say, a Nelly or Little Jon.  All I can say is, Murs deserves to be one of the TOP emcees in the business. And in my opinion, he is, by far. It would be interesting to see a colaboration between Murs and say, Mos Def or The Roots.  All in all, BUY THIS CD"
5,"Bow Wow Wow is not a Household Name, They Charted Once in the USA with ""I want Candy"" (Top 50), and released only 3 Proper Albums...Their Sound is Tribal, the Lead Singer Annabella often Yelps to Percussive Drumming and throbbing Bass, The Mixture yields Many Great Tunes, but it can take getting used to, as it did for Me, I was not a Fan untill much listening...If You don't know a lot of the Group's Songs, I suggest listening to as many 30 second Samples as possible to get a feeling of whether this stuff is digestible...Most of the Songs here are first-rate, I particularly Love ""TV Savage"", ""Golly Golly Go Buddy!"" and ""Louis Qatorze"", along with Annabella's Solo Turn ""Fever""....If You want to explore further, I suggest the CD ""Girl Bites Dog: Your Compact Disc Pet"" to round out Your Collection, it includes more Gems, such as ""Sexy Effiel Tower"" (Where 14 Year-Old Annabella Pants Orgasmically...and more authentically than Donna Summer)and ""Radio G String"", as well as 3 Cuts from this CD in different versions; But begin here, and don't go further unless You Adore this CD...."
5,"One of my top fave Rasputina albums. Tons of great songs, very few joke songs, and great art work"
5,"I've been listening to Chris Cornell for about two years, after discovering him in Audioslave. Then I heard ""Black Hole Sun"" and ""Spoonman"" and after that more or less forgot about Soundgarden. My friend lent me this CD one day and I forgot about it for a month or two and finally listened to it yesterday and well...Wow. First off, Chris Cornell has one of the strongest, most recognizable voices in rock and he has such range it's amazing. These songs are all hard, raw, catchy, and all have a great guitar & drum sound. ""Outshined"" is probably my favorite Soundgarden song of all time. No rock fan should pass this up:  1. Rusty Cage-5/5-One of my favorite Soundgarden songs. It's fu**ing great; Chris Cornell hits some great notes too. 2. Outshined-5/5-Fu**ing killer! The chorus is catchy as hell. 3. Slaves & Bulldozers-5/5-Chris Cornell has an awesome screaming voice. This song has some good lyrics, guitar solo is good, and Matt Cameron's drumming stands out. 4. Jesus Christ Pose-5/5-I don't know what this song is about, but it kicks  a$$. The music (guitar & drumming anyway) is really good. 5. Face Pollution-5/5-Great title, the song is OK. The shortest song on the album. I know I'm probably hallucinating but it sounds like Maynard James Keenan (lead singer of Tool) is singing gibberish at the end. 6. Somewhere-5/5-The most harmonious song on the album, but there's still some ""screamage"". 7. Searching With My Good Eye Closed-5/5-The opening of the song with a man naming animals and what they say and finally stating ""The devil sounds like this"" and then Cornell begins singing is great. Really good lyrics too. 8. Room a Thousand Years Wide-4/5-The music is good, but the vocals are kind of overshadowed by the music;  hence 4/5 9. Mind Riot-5/5-Easily has the least amount of screaming of any of the songs. Cornell sings the song perfectly. 10. Drawing Flies-5/5-Lyrics are good. 11. Holy Water-5/5-(No Comment) 12. New Damage-5/5-One of the best on the album. The album goes out with a bang!  "
5,"I have to say my fav songs are when Amy Lee sits down at the piano and isn't up running around, she sounds *wonderful*. "
4,"I first listened to this CD on my work sound system which does not do it justice.  I was only mildly impressed and was preparing to submit a scathing review with the main focus being ""mediocrity at its best.""  But then I took it home and put it on a real sound system. VOILA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  While I still contend that Gerald is infinitely more viable as a premiere session man than a solo artist, this second outing with GRP is far superior to ""Groovology;""  the former project seemed to be a classic example of an artist suffering from musician's block. ""Kickin' It"" is the exact opposite - with help from the likes of Jeff Lorber and George Duke, it appears creativity was at an all-time high with the end result being a wonderful project that you will enjoy over and over again.  The arrangements are tight with fresh interpretations, a nice ode to Jr. Walker and some oh so nice tunes in collaboration with Lorber.  Quite honestly, I haven't been this impressed with a Gerald Albright project in quite a whie.  It appears he is finally hittinhg his stride and I could not be more pleased.  Niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice, Gerald!!!"
4,"Originally released in 1993, Dark Tranquility's Skydancer remains a masterpiece.  Along with At the Gates, In Flames, Carcass, Death and Edge of Sanity, Dark Tranquility created the genre known as melodic death metal. Everything expected of a good melodic death album is here. Aggresive sounds juxtaposed with acoustic parts, an inteligent concept and growled vocals.  Mikeal Stanne is one of the only vocalists who can sound pissed off and peaceful all at the same time.  Many of the ideas such as using female vocals for different effects were way ahead of their time as well. Can't give a perfect rating though because while it's original, the production isn't very well done and they hadn't quite hit the peak of their skills yet"
2,"I was not pleased with the quality of this recording.  The McGarrigles are just wonderful, but the sound engineering of the album is a disaster.  The first and last cuts seem OK, but the ones in between are overridden so badly by the heavy-handed instruments that it all just seem noisy!  The piano in particular was so loud that the songs were unintelligible.  I also didn't appreciate the sisters' reworking of several songs I already love from ""The Bells of Dublin"" (some of the best Christmas music ever recorded).  The sparkle I longed for just isn't there in this one"
5,"Sleater-Kinney's Dig Me Out is not only one of the finest records of the 1990's, it's a pivotal cross-section of 90's music - spitfire women striking independence on one end, vulnerable earthy types pow-wowing on the other.  It may be a masterful sonic assault of punk fury, but it's punk fury mixed with intimacy and fragility.  When Corin Tucker wails in the title track to dig her, ""out of my body, out of my skin,"" you feel wounded alright, but it's in the humanity of such a line and the honesty of its production.  The songs don't let down from there - the sad love-triangle crackdown of ""One More Hour,"" the fury of ""Words and Guitar,"" the sexiness of ""Dance Song '97.""  This is the moment that a very good band became a great one with the capacity to topple over rock's foundation by aiming for its heart"
5,"hes great to listen to, his songs are really good and are easy to sing along to especially manifesto # 1 is my fave"
4,"While Steely Dan has received the compilation treatment on more than one occassion, the latest ""Definitive Collection"" brings some of the band's best known work onto a single disc. Also, for completeness, one track each from their 'reunion' CDs are included here. Steely classics such as ""Do It Again"", ""Reelin' In The Years"", ""Rikki Don't Lose That Number"", ""Black Friday"", ""Deacon Blues"", ""Peg"" and ""Hey Nineteen"" are all included here and sound just as fresh and unique as they did back in the day. While this collection is an ideal place to start for the beginning Dan fan because of its songs and low price, it should be noted that there is one glaring omission to this Definitive Collection - the all-time classic ""Josie"". Granted, this CD is already packed to its limits with close to 78-minutes of music and is excellent from start to finish. However, including ""Josie"" and dropping a track like, say ""Dirty Work"" (writer's opinion) would have made this collection a lot stronger and cohesive overall. I guess this is how the band wanted it because they were indeed involved with the compilation of this collection.  Apart from this, Steely Dan's ""Definitive Collection"" is a great introduction to the band. For a more comprehensive overview, check out the double-disc compilation ""Show Biz Kids"" which includes all of the tracks included here (minus the two 'reunion' tracks) plus many many more."
5,"If you've ever liked the T-Bone Walker style, or drooled over the pure T-Bone licks that both Ronnie and Duke have graced us with over the years, ""Two Bones and a Pick"" is eight minutes of pure jump-blues-guitar-heaven.  I can, and do listen to this for hours on end.  If any two white guys have got that jump-blues-guitar-thang down, it's these two.  T-Bone is grinning like a Cheshire cat"
4,First off; I really appreciate artists or labels that give you at least 60 minutes of play time and don't cut out lengthy guitar solos.  This CD certainly delivers in this regard as Ronnie Earl and the Duke trade guitar jams in creative duets for a solid 70 plus minutes.  This is a close 5 star recommendation but it isn't a classic and it isn't groundbreaking; although I would think some reviewers would seriously disagree with that point.  It's just damn good music by two pros whose different styles compliment one another.  Highly recommended.
4,"The first time I heard Cannibal Ox was last winter in my friends snowboard video. He did the intro over the first and in my opinion BEST track on the CD Iron Galaxy. Basically that got me interested in the group and I later found out that they were correlated with one of my favorite groups ever Company Flow.  I copped their CD, but waited a really long time to listen to it. It's pretty futuristic, kind of abstract like Deltron 3030 (another one of my favs), while the lyrical content is nowhere near Deltron (hell, what is?) it is very good. I mean obviously you should expect to hear a LOT of Co-Flow when you listen to this, so if you're not a fan it might not be the best idea to pick this one up. The CD has some very good songs A B-Boys Alpha, Atom, and another one of my favorites, The Battle For Asgard. However I think some songs on here tanked the whole album. For one- a couple of the tracks on the CD are weakly produced, Stress Rap & Painkillers. And a couple tracks seems like they just sorted started thinking of words that rhymed in the studio and went with that, Vein & Real Earth.  Basically this CD is 80% genius, so 4 stars is what it gets-and to be honest I'd like to just give it 3.5 because I feel they coulda done a lot better"
1,"Nelly is one of the most annoying ignorant rappers I have ever heard. I do give him props on his first album, but he went downhill and started that whole ""I can make great club beats, but write bubblegum lyrics over it"" trend. This sadly created all the Chingys, Lil Johns and so on. The guy doesn't add any substance to his music, yet he sells millions thanks to MTV. Just save your money on real artist that makes real music"
1,"THE CARS HAVE TO BE ONE OF THE MOST OVERRATED BANDS OF ALL TIME. THEY HAVE ONLY MADE 1 DECENT SONG IN BYE BYE LOVE. REST OF THEIR SONGS JUST PLAIN SUCK. I MEAN WHY DO PEOPLE LOVE LOUSY BANDS IN QUEEN, CARS, ACDC, BEATLES, STONES, WHO, STEVE MILLER, AND BOSTON? GOOD BANDS ARE REQUIRED TO BE DIRE STRAITS, FOREIGNER, GUNS N' ROSES, NIRVANA, GREEN DAY, AEROSMITH, AND JOE WALSH. DON'T READ THE 5 STAR REVIEWERS FOR THIS TERRIBLE COMPILATION. GO GET A BETTER ALBUM FROM NIRVANA INSTED. PS THE CARS SUCK"
2,"paul what were you thinking? you do so good on mixtapes lyricly and on get ya mind correct but on this no effort! ok first im a playa taken from still tippin, internet goiong nutz from still tippin all with corny flows repeatative terms but some songs were good sittin sideways was already rammed into my head like a year before it came out so what does that leave you with? surp sippin bugz bunny? what? chick magnet or how to be a player should have been re released instead of this cd! big ballin was pretty good but still the cd is just not worth listenen to buy the paul wall mixtape its got all the good songs and more the mixtape is way better trust me! he needs some new flows! fo real! oh yeah this tracklist aint right atleast with the cd i got."
1,"Wack rhymes make me puke via my ear canal. That's how wack Paul Wall is. After I have eaten a full meal and listened to Paul wall, My dinner is regurgitated through my ears. I am sooooooooooo tired of these garbage rappers polluting the airwaves with garbage. This guy wouldn't know lyrical content if I slapped him with a Mos Def CD"
2,"Kim Waters is one of the nicest persons one could meet, but that still does not prevent me from giving a brutally frank review that will hopefully help him in the future. While I could tell that considerable time was put in this project, that drum machine killed this effort. The music here is so mechanical and irritating from that drum machine, I just can't stand to listen to it. The drum machine cheapens the sound so much that I cannot recommend this CD to real music lovers especially those with decent audio systems. The only composition that sounds like real music is ""Daydreaming"", but this too is somewhat marred by that mechanical drum machine although less than the others. Kim, please use real drums from now on. You are a seasoned smooth jazz artist with great talent, but you cheapen your production relying on a drum machine. That machine sounds mechanical with no spontaneity. You are too advance as an artist to have to rely on it. It may cost a little more for a real drummer, but you are in a class where real drums are indispensible"
5,"This is an excellent CD.  It is fun to dance to, sing to, and drive to.  It doesn't matter if you like country music or not-you can enjoy Keith Urban's music.  Even better than his CD's are his live shows.  Well worth the ticket price and one of the best concerts you will see. "
5,"Well, I have to confess that I had never heard of Chris until I was taken to a concert back in 2004. Of all the bands that played that night, I have to admit Chris really reached me.  This CD has a good balance between worshipful songs and ones that rock. Chris' lead guitarist often sounds somewhat similar to U2's 'the Edge' especially on 'Forever' which really adds a great dimension to the song.  I had never fully appreciated worship songs until I heard Chris do 'How Great is Our God' which gave me a whole new perspective and is very effectively captured on this CD.  Besides those tunes, the CD becomes a must-buy with the inclusion of a superb energetic version of 'Indescribable' and other popular songs such as 'Famous One' & 'Raise Up Holy Hands.'  I had been hoping since that concert that he would release a CD from that tour, and my hope has now been answered (imagine that).   2/06 update: eight of us just saw Chris again in Saginaw, MI and days later we all agreed that it was one of the best worship experiences of our lives.  It's certainly difficult for a CD to fully match the experience of being there, but with the right perspective, it can get you pretty close.  Be sure to try and see Chris on his current tour w/Matt Redman & speaker Louie Giglio"
5,"I have to admit, it took me awhile to actually enjoy Relient K. I used to think their music was very generic and their lyrics were cheesy. But this album changed everything for me. Matt Thiessen is such a clever lyricist, using enough word plays to delight the wordsmith in me, but also making me think more deeply about my relationship with God and others.  The band sticks to their standard pop-punk riffs on this album, though I believe they use smoother speed and instrumental transitions on this album. Example: Be My Escape starts with screaming guitars and a fast beat, softens down to keyboards, vocals and light drumming during the verses, back up to rocking during the bridge and chorus, and slows right down for a touching finish. There are several other songs that vary in a like manner.  Lyrically, I really enjoyed Be My Escape (but the beauty of grace is that it makes life not fair), Which to Bury, Us or the Hatchet (I move you, but you just wouldn't budge, I tried to hold your hand but you'd rather hold your grudge), When I Go Down (When I go down, I'll lift my eyes to You, but I won't look too far, 'Cause You'll be there with open arms, to lift me up again...). What a beautiful way to end the album!  Musically, many songs stand out - High of 75 is probably the most original song, starting with acoustic guitar, and including a drum loop in the chorus. Other highlights include Who I am Hates Who I've Been, and Life After Death & Taxes, which combines great vocals with some cool screaming!  Relient K has made a fan out of me, and if you buy this album, it will do the same for you"
1,"I have seen these guys twice, once opening for six feet under, and the other for strapping young lad. And god almighty both times i wanted to bash my head in concrete to keep from hearing these guys. Overall these guys suck even the heavy parts and the melodic parts will put you to sleep. Stop trying to be unearth and opeth and make good music like they do.."
2,"If you've listened to Alison Krauss, you've heard the best.  Rhonda's arrangements and voice were adequate, but nothing special, and I doubt I'll listen to the CD again. "
1,"This musician, if you can call him that, should be embarrassed.  If he has something to say, more people would listen if he didn't use such vulgar language and stopped talking about his body parts.  I won't be buying this and my kids won't either.  Repulsive"
2,"In the past few months, I have gotten super into all of Devendra's other works, and was excited for another little delicious surprise like the others when I first picked this album up.  Oh, what a dissapointment I was in for.  The album does not carry through it's energy as many of Banhart's other albums do so well.  Also, having already heard many other versions of the same songs that are on here on his split album with Jana Hunter, I found these to be much more dull, and did not carry forward their emotion in the way that the other recordings do.  That being said, Devendra is always quite alright, if not wonderful.  I find his voice to be entirely charming, and he is generally a very talented song writer.    So, the moral?  If you couldn't really get into this recording, please don't give up on Devendra yet.  I highly recommend ""Cripple Crow"", his split album with Jana Hunter, and, if you are into music that is slightly more raw, ""The Black Babies"", which is my personal favorite"
5,"I had the opportunity to see Tom Braxton play for an extremely happy crowd at his almamader, Dunbar Middle School (then Dunbar High School). ""Julian's Smile"" and ""Bounce"" are superbly played, smoothe and fresh sound. See him live if you get the chance, buy the CD anyway"
1,"Drew's Famous Party Music is a joke. I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased this cd. In the past 3 weeks, I have probably ordered 8 or 9 compilation cd's looking for great music from the 70s, 80s and 90's for a party I am hosting. I read the reviews for the other cd's and they were great, but in my excitement about finding Whoomp there it is and Love Train, I didn't check the reviews for this cd. This CD is not at all what I thought it would be. Trust me, THIS IS NOT THE ONE, it's not even on the list. I was looking for Whoomp there it is, and especially Love Train by the Ojays. Not what I got. I excitedly listened to Whoomp, and I kept saying this doesn't sound right. Something sounds like its missing from the song. So I listened to Love Train, and immediately, I knew that it was not the Ojays singing. I realized that none of the original artists were singing. This is a terrible misrepresentation. I was so disappointed! Thank goodness I listened to the cd before I played it at the party. I would have been horrified. I wish I could give it less than one star and get a refund. Please, please, please DON'T waste your money"
5,"This album further compliments the astonishing work the artist has done along with the spectacular singing of The Love Fellowship Choir! I must say when I hear the work of this ensemble I am all ears because I'm never disappointed in knowing they will always ""Bring it"" !!  God Bless!!"
5,"TERMINAL HEAVEN'S ROCK IS A GREAT SONG! Sick Vibration and OVER AMP are pretty good too. OVER AMP has usual weird english lyrics. ""She lives by fake slide away"".  I highly recomend you get this. It's 12 minutes, 8 seconds a pure good songs. You will listen to them at least three times each time you pop it into your CD player"
5,"I like every song.  Unlike many other bands, this CD is just as good as their previous CD"
2,"all of the songs on this album are very good, however it doesn't live up to standards. sublimes a much better band than this album shows. if your a casual fan, i would not recomoned this to start. instead, i'd recomend ""40 oz. to Freedom"" thats my personal favorite Sublime album. it may not have all the hits on it, but is much better than robbin the hood and self-titled. great songs, terrible compilatio"
2,"When I listened to this CD I actually expected to hear Gloria Estafan singing on some of these songs.  Some of them seem like they were written for her.  Wild Card has a few good songs on it.  The title track is okay.  Moonlight and King Of Hearts are better.  The last good CD by the Rippington's was Weekend In Monaco.  Changes in personnel, locations, and labels haven't proved to be too good for Russ's music.  He's made his money and can experiment with various ideas.  Wild Card is loser in my opinion, but at least it's better than Brave New World"
5,"This album was released three years after the New Pornographers awesome debut album. This album is similar, but has a more glossy feel than the previous album. The album is definately more polished. Great synths and percussion throughout the album. Electric Version is an enjoyable and easy listen, chock-full of hungry hooks and brimming with indie rock's classic humility"
5,"Guns N'Roses are one of my all time favorite bands, so this album is a little disappointing, don't get me wrong, nearly every song on here is great there are just other songs that are more deserving. It just so happens though that record labels never get greatest hits album right, just look at Led Zeppelin's Greatist hits. The only reason the record label released this anyways was because Axl was taking way to long for Chinese Domocracy and they wanted some money, so they put this out, and it has gathered a good deal of money. This Album does do a good job of confirming what all real rock fans already know, that Guns N' Roses are one of the biggest and best rock bands of all time. They came at a time when rock and roll needed a savior, and they did just that, they brought some soul and attitude back in to the music. Songs like november rain, welcome to the jungle, and paradise city really highlight the bands strong points, thus making this album a good starting point for a new fan. I would reccomend buying all their albums though, because all of them are genius, except for the spaghetti incident, which was just a cover album anyways.  This album did fail to include classic cuts like Mr.Brownstone, It Ain't easy, Nighttrain, Rocket Queen, and others and for that I am angry. Also, how on earth did the sympathy for the devil cover get on here, it is simply terrible, possibly the worst Guns N' Roses song ever. So, if you are already a huge fan and have all the albums, don't get this, save your money for chinese democracy it is going to come, there have been rumors of a release before the year's end. I have heard live versions of songs from the album and they are incredible, cuts like madagascar, the blues, Rhiad and the Bedouins reaffirmed my belief in Axl, and I think if this album ever hits the light of day it will be huge. Also check out a band called Rose hill Drive, they are the most exciting band out today and any true fan of rock and roll should enjoy them."
5,A great white noise kind of CD.  Just plain rain.  Well I must admit it sounds a wee bit like frying bacon to me.  Whatever.  My babies both nap really well to it.  I recommend it to my mommy friends.  It's been a must at our house
2,"This record is not Robben Ford at his best, uninspired playing and singing and the lyrics are really at a low level, not a good record at all."
4,"This CD is just okay. The early JB ballads are the thing here. Gives you a good idea of a good chitlin' circuit performance as typically done for Black audiecnes in those days with approrpiate audience response. The standouts here include the extended version of &quot;Lost Someone&quot; which leads into &quot;Please Please Please.&quot; Even without being able to see the infamous cape routine, it's quite entertaining. But overall, Vol. 2 is better since that CD plays up the more uptempo stuff that put JB on the map"
5,"Ok, so KS has a similar voice to Conor Oberst. So what? What's the big deal? Blink-182, Good Charlotte, and Simple Plan all sound exactly the same, and they're getting five star reviews! Just lay off of it. And, even though their voices are similar, their music is much different, they sound different. They even use orchestras and accordions and brass and woodwinds and... well, that's it. But this is not your ordinary rip off folk/indie band. And, maybe his voice naturally sounds like Conor Oberst's. You can't help that. An Angle are very talented and experiment with different sounds. I pop this CD in from time to time, not my favorite, but it's very good! So, just give this a chance without thinking it as a Bright Eyes rip-off, because that's just what it's not"
5,"I came to beastie boys on the back of vague recommendations from a mate, not knowing what to expect. Initially, i got licensed to ill, which i enjoyed for what it is, but it was not the stuff i had been recommended. I moved to check your head, and was pleasantly surprised at songs like pass the mic, so what'cha want, live at pjs. Since then, I have been ABSOLUTELY blown away by this album. There is no other album i know of that combines punk-rock, metal, acid jazz, funk, world beats, and hip-hop, in the same album, sometimes even in the same song. And it makes for a great mix.  Not only is this album a great mix of styles, but it is produced crisply, with the vocals mixed down slightly to become an accompaniment to the rest of the instruments, synths blending seamlessly in and out of the music, and the tribal beats laying the foundation for some great songs. The beasties manage to record and mix accordingly for the style of each song style they attempt.  And they attempt a lot. Songs like 'The Update', 'Futterman's Rule' are a psychedelic funk-fest, with tribal world beats as a backbone,synths everywhere and funky guitar licks, i cant help but love them. Songs like 'Sabotage' and 'Heart Attack Man' make for a change of pace, with great punk metal riffs, and fast heavy drum beats. My personal favourite simply for its ingenuity and awesome sound is flute loop; who else but the Beasties could take a folk sounding flute riff, and bring it into the hip-hop world with funky beats, mad scratches and mad lyrics? No one, thats who.  Ultimately, there is something here for a fan of every type of music.I recommend this album to anyone who loves funk, punk, hip-hop, or jazz.  My recommendations are: The Update, Futterman's Rule, Flute Loop, Sure Shot, Heart Attack Man, B-Boys making with the Freak Freak.  Enjoy"
5,"I'm ashamed to say that, even as an adult, I love the music on this CD! The kids listen to it in the car and on their little CD player. They are older (8 and 11), so they already knew the lower times tables, but all the songs are great so we listen to them anyway and now they can remember all the numbers. (They go up to 13.)  It's a long CD - definately longer than other kids music - but it has a story to it that follows along with the songs. It's like listening to a book on tape. After years of Barney and SpongeBob (neither did much for my kids' brains), I'm so glad to have something that *I* can sing along with too"
5,"I had forgotten over the years just how wonderful this album was, so I was thrilled to find it here at Amazon! Granted, it's not the heavy black vinyl with the faded dog earred cover, but this one fits in my car stereo, makes the commute miles fly by and sounds even better then it did long ago! Thanks"
1,"Troy why did you put your name on this.  This cd has one good song on it and that is about the long and short of it.  I am not going to waste a bunch of time talking about a cd that is not worthy of being pressed, by the way the group was better with Conrad the Colonel (Ehhhh Hehhh!  I AM DSGB!"
5,"OutKast had been out for a minute but this album made me become a true fan and recognize their creativity.  This album is crunk, it's exciting, it's brilliantly put together and a fine example of hip hop at its best.  OutKast is pioneering and yet so fantastic they're almost mainstream now -- but in a good way (OutKast is the anti-Black Eyed Peas, LOL).  Stankonia just continues OutKast's everchanging shape that keeps taking hip hop to higher levels.  If you've listened to Southernplayalisticadilacmuzik, ATLiens and Aquemini, you probably know to expect the unexpected on this album.  Stankonia is one of the hip hop albums I always throw up in debates as proof that good hip hop can still simultaneously make you dance/groove and think at the same time.  That Andre 3000 is deceptively very, very political, but you gotta pay attention or you'll miss his messages.  Highly recommended LP. Fun and crunk with hidden social/political commentary. One of my all-time favorite albums"
1,"This type of music is like a blister on the brain.  You can't get rid of it and it is irritating.  Yes, this is the problem with most FM radio when this CD from 4 years ago is still getting played.  And the tune to ""This Love"" is beyond annoying as he pauses between each word.  Moron 5 rank up there with Gwen Stefani and Black Eyes Peas for most annoying, successful artists"
1,"Nine inch nails are the only band on this cd worth listening to, this sound track is crap"
1,"Before you dismiss me as a stupid hater, hear me out. I personally think Omarion is a reasonably good singer & one helluva great dancer, but I swear to God that this is one of the worst albums I've ever heard.   This album is entirely deprived of emotional depth & there's not a shred of originality in sight or -more importantly- in sound. You've got love, sex & below-average club bangers, but nothing beyond that! If there's anything that annoys me more than the fact that I bothered taking the time to listen to this near-worthless junk, it's knowing that Omarion's fans & groupies were insane enough to blow their hard-earned cash & propel this album into the #1 spot on the Billboard Album Top 200! That says alot about musical standards nowadays.  However, there are some bright spots on the album that show hints of true potential in Omarion. ""I Wish"" is a beautiful slow jam about wishing he never fell in love with his certain girl, while Omarion's hit single, titled ""O"", will have any girl melting slowly as they listen to his smooth vocals, regardless of unoriginal subject matter. ""Touch"" is also another highlight, combining catchy, simplistic, danceable beats with smooth vocals & unoriginal subject matter (in this case, lust & sex). Then again, most club bangers don't need much substance, so it's no big deal in this case. I personally think this track deserved more success. Oh yeah, better not forget ""Growing Pains"", a touching song that explains Omarion's break-up with former hit R&B/Pop group B2K!  However, 3 great tracks & 1 above-avergae track (Touch) are not enough to save this album from falling apart. The rest of of this album is utter garbage (to put it lightly), and anyone with at least 1/2 a brain will realize how tragic this album really is. Omarion needs to put more thought & substance into his music before anybody truly begins to take him seriously! I hope Omarion improves if he decides to make a 2nd solo album, but until then, definitely skip this!!   NB: In case anybody's wondering why I bothered to review an album I consider to be so bad, it's because I feel that nobody, and I mean NOBODY, should be wasting their hard-earned cash on such ridicious, mentally corruptive Bubblegum cr*p like this. Not only that, but Omarion doesn't deserve the success his album got. There's obviously many more artists out there who are more deserving of success than Omarion in terms of a solo career"
5,"Time Without Consequence is one of those albums. One of the ones that you can put into your cd player and just feel completely enveloped by the music. The quiet, gentle intensity of this album is just outstanding. Murdoch seems to be singing/playing so effortlessly and at the same time pouring his entire soul into the music. It is a dichotomy that is present throughout the entire album and it works extremely well.   The comparisons between Murdoch and Nick Drake are valid, and that is actually the first time I've said that, which is amazing considering how many artists people compare to Nick Drake. The biggest similarity between the two is the quiet intensity they bring to their music. But Murdoch goes beyond Nick Drake in the sense that he is not just a Drake clone, and his songs showcase Murdoch's own identity and direction.   I won't go into individual songs, because I'm sure others will review the album song by song. I'll just say that I although I have my favorites, there aren't any bad songs on this album. All the songs are quality pieces of music and none deserve to be skipped over. This will probably be the top album of the year for me, and it is definitely the best I've heard so far. Great music."
5,"This album is Sting's prophetic masterpiece, a brilliant work of rocknroll genius with a soul, a conscience, and some of the most powerful, beautiful songs written. In this ablum Sting addresses crucial political issues of our time, and timeless subjects like love, redemption, war, and more, in poetry that ranks with the very best. Like others, I loved Dream of the Blue Turtles and Nothing Like the Sun, but Sacred Love truly surpasses them in its depth, maturity, passion, varied range and lyrical beauty. This is as good as rock gets, and it rarely gets close to this good. That said, ""Sacred Love"" may make some people uncomfortable due to the issues Sting takes on here, and to the new territory he is exploring through his art. And it may go over the heads of those who don't want rock and roll to challenge them, musically, politically or spiritually. Thank God for artists like Sting who follow their muse with unwavering integrity and let the chips fall where they may"
1,"The power of marketing behind Mrs. Souza is incredible! Her previous album, Brazilian Duos, was listed among the Best Jazz Albums of 2001 by New York Times - a critic, Mr. Ben Ratliff, had received an advance CD copy and included the album on his list, although the album only would be officially released in April 2002...Strange? Well, the next year the same Mr. Ratliff, in the same NY Times, included the same CD in his Best Jazz Albums of 2002 list...Then, &quot;Brazilian Duos&quot; got a Grammy nomination in March 2003...And now, in a few days, this horrible &quot;North and South&quot; CD will receive a Grammy nomination for Best Jazz Vocal Album...No more comments"
5,"There is not much to say about this album that has not been said already.  It was the first of many albums that solidified the jump of the british psychadelic band pink floyd into the worldwide limelight, unsurpassed Jagernaut that it became.  It has a very timeless sound, and flows effortlessly from one song to another and just takes you through an unsurpassed journey from beginning to end.  Time, Money, Us and Them, and Brain Damage are my amongt my top 20 floyd songs of all time.  If you need to own one floyd album, it should be this album.  Pallatable to all old fans, and to new ones. "
4,this is a well done soundtrack...my only complaint about it is that the violin parts can get a bit tedious...but I guess they are really good because I didn't  even notice them when I saw the movie...so...overall...very good! ...also a very creepy them
5,"Fleetwood Mac in the 70's and early 80's were the biggest band on the planet. With a new line-up that included Stevie Nicks and Lindsay Buckingham they owned the music world. Rumors is still on the top 5 best sellers of all-time. This compilation includes all their hits and some rare gems as well. Silver Springs was recorded during the Rumors sessions. Stevie Nicks asked if she could use the song for a solo album. Mick Fleetwood did not allow her to use the song. It was later recorded for the Dance and became a major hit for them in the 90's The version you hear on this compilation is the one recorded for Rumors in the 70's Its almost frightening that a song this good was not included on Rumors. Fleetwood Mac continues to tour and record and still makes great music. This is for the serious Fleetwood Mac fan who wants to hear rare gems, and cant not get enough of their classic songs"
5,"Oh my goodness....I had this on a vinyl LP back when I was a very young teenager and nearly drove my parents CRAZY with it. I listened to it 3 times a day for about two years....about 700 times or more...when I was 14 and 15.  Now that I listen to it again, I see it was terribly formative for me, a major influence on my life.  I never realized how much the lyrics interweave through my psyche even now, miles away, years later....Buy this and it will change your life"
4,just wanted to say my mom liked this album so he has changed tremendiously. thats al
1,"A terrible, terrible waste of money. All this CD serves in doing is to illustrate what a knuckle-head Paul Godfrey is. Face it: no one gives a sh@t about Morcheeba anymore, we're not interested in who 'inspired' them, (poor Annette Peacock - has anyone told her?). The next time we see Paul Godfrey he'll probably be asking that age-old question: &quot;paper or plastic?&quot"
5,"As a completist Gram fan since 1969, the alternate versions of We'll Sweep Out the Ashes, Streets of Baltimore, and Hickory Wind are truly otherworldly.  Well worth the price, in and of themselves"
5,"I was too young to be in love at that time but I remember jamming to "" No More Lies"" on the radio. In fact, I enjoy the whole album, and listen to them all except ""If"" and ""Special Thanks"" - her squeaky voice cracks me up"
1,"This guy is a pop music clown who ruins careers. OLP have no business working with him and the result shows. OLP is way out of Ballards league and I have no idea why they would limit themselves to his naive view of pop music. Perhaps OLP wanted to have a sell-out sound, otherwise this disc is a disaster. Somewhere out there is pure disposable pop. None of this material would be on ""Happiness"" or ""Spiritual Machines"" How can you go from a concept album from a Ray Kurzveil book to a horrible Glen Ballard. over produced, pop record"
5,"Michael Giacchino's score for Mission: Impossible 3 is an excellent blend of action music and a grat adaption of Schiffen's classic music.  As he did with the Incredibles, Giacchino shows the ability to write a classic score that fits perfectly with the film and stands up well on its own.  Probably the best of the three Mission scores.  Elfman's matched his own style, Zimmer's matched his, but Giacchino's matched Mission:Impossibles"
5,"From the pop title track, a duet with Kid rock protege Uncle Kracker,to the heartstring tug of There goes my life, this album has great range and thoughtful lyrics which are absent in many other genres. Chesney is perfectly positioned to become a crossover star, earning the status  more from his music than his pretty boy image. Aside from the title track, most songs refreshingly veer from his beachcombing, young jimmy Buffet beach anthems that are characteristic of his earlier work"
1,"Here, in all their glory, is REM: the undisputed Pied Pipers of the bedwetters.  While Michael Stipe's nasal delivery evoked all the comfort of a German Stuka dive-bomber, the whimpering and ludicrous lyrical content became a beacon-call to legions of self-absorbed suburban cry-babies everywhere.  In REM, we had a calculating and maudlin brood of cynical mountebanks who lounged in opulence while tormenting their naive minions with a decades-long barrage of unrestrained nonsense and pessimistic doomsaying.  The embarrassing spectacle probably hit its painful peak in 1992, but it obviously has left a cultural skid mark that will take years to eradicate.  This album is a one star stinker that might serve well as a gag gift"
5,"""Honky Chateau"" is an example of why Greatest Hits albums just do not work for great artists. This early Elton John effort is an example of when John and Taupin had some edge and grit to their songs with some western influence. The whole album seems interconnected with excellent music, vocals and words that bond to one of their greatest collaborations. ""Rocket Man"" was the big hit during the albums original debut but the many of the other songs were virtually bigger in quality and longevity. ""Honky Cat"" starts with a smart jazzy sound with Elton in a cocky voice talking about his ""redneck ways"" that jumps and hops but in the next song he steps down and eases into the song ""Mellow"", which slows up to a laid back story of love behind close doors with a lover that makes him sing in a tired but pleased voice ""You make me mellow, oh you make me mellow"" and the song does make you ease into feeling the mellow he sings about. I like the sound and lyrics of all the songs but the oddly up tempo song about a typical teenager being morose in ""I think I am going to Kill Myself"" is spritely entertaining sound of a youth complaining about small transgressions like not using the car then he downshifts suddenly  down in a lyrical sound into a slowing middle eight of ""Get a little headline news, I'd like to see what the papers say, On the state of teenage blues"", particularly when Elton soulfully extends the word blues into a long bluesy wail that just puts this song in a unique category. Salvation is an almost gospel sounding song that starts off slow with ""I have to say my friends, this road goes a long, long way"" with great guitars and backing harmonies that is virtually uplifting in a sound that is optimistic in spite of the challenges exposed in the lyrics. ""Amy"" is just a fun tune that sounds like a young man teased by a wild and more mature woman and he sings with pain and but with optimism in his voice ""Amy I may not be James Dean, Amy I may not be nineteen, And I may still be in romper boots and jeans, But Amy you're the girl that wrecks my dreams"". One of the ultimate classics is ""Mona Lisa"" an up lifting song about a tough life in NY city that crosses the dimensions of different type of people, the poor and the affluent as Elton mournfully sings ""Until you've seen this trash can dream come true, You stand at the edge while people run you through, And I thank the Lord there's people out there like you, I thank the Lord there's people out there like you"" that in the end is uplifting, that he has found something and someone in a tough time and place. Finishing with a flourish, ""Hercules"" is a rollicking tune about being in love with a woman who is unfortunately in love with a muscleman, a ""cat named Hercules"".  The song has John with an excellent vocal with backing vocals with a touch of beach boys' sound and although the song seems to end in defeat, it sounds like the man will persevere with a touch of humor. ""Rocket Man"" is the classic song that Elton used to sing for 20 minutes in concert and it is a great song about a man being a long way from home in a cold desolate environment but the whole album is full of great songs and perhaps this is the best John/Taupin collaboration. The additional alternate version of the western sounding ""Slave"" is more up tempo than the original and is very good but the core 10 songs are just wonderful and always memorable.          "
2,"High record sales are often inversely proportionate to the effect on the morale of the bands concerned. Blur became household names in Britain because of this album, especially through cheerful cockney singalong sinle ""Parklife"", but it messed them up in terms of moving on as a band: it is also the album which was responsible for singer/writer Damon Albarn's mental breakdown.   But what did they expect? This is , after all, the album that summed up Britain's geezer culture: where men are men and women act like men as well. Where the Thatcherism of the 80s has never really gone away, and it's okay to Look After Number 1 and act like a bit or a moron. This album, for better or worse (in my opinion, worse) is more representative of Britain in the 90s and noughties than anything else. If you're American and still think that Britain is all Hugh Grants and tea on the village green, forget it. And here's the proof.  The album itself is cheerful enough, but totally uninspired. It bears none of the influence from American acts of the 80s and 90s, like Nirvana, Sonic Youth, the Meat Puppets or Dinosaur Jr., or Brit acts like My Bloody Valentine. Guitarist Graham Coxon's love of these bands hardly shows in the songs, because they're written by Albarn. Just tunes, many of which are distinctly ordinary. Even much-lauded songs like ""This Is a Low"" are let-downs, because they don't display any real savvy for what makes modern music any different from the songcraft of the Beatles or the Kinks. Indeed, Blur are just like a modern Kinks. Just without the great songs.  It's sad that with this album, Blur confirmed what the title of their previous album had said. Modern life IS rubbish"
1,I received the first recording and in the final movement there was a bad skipping. I notified Amazon and they sent me another recording which had the same problem. I received a credit and Amazon said the recording was evidently a bad one and they would check it out. Thanks Billy Lede
1,"Dont buy this CD. I dont know what all the hype is about, but boy was I fooled. The lyrics and the flow are below average, and yeah, there are some weird sounds in there, but the beats are nothing special either. I bought this, put it in my car, and within a couple songs I had to turn it off. I tried the next day, same thing. There is a lot of good underground hip-hop out there, so buy some of it instead"
5,"Psychedelia and hip-hop. Those are two words I never thought I'd be relating when referring to one of my favorite albums of 2005. I still can't get over it. What a phenomenal idea. The Boston based rapper Edan possesses more than just an untouchable flow. He's also the producer, programmer, engineer, sampler...you name it, he does it all. The production held within is bafflingly perfect. He's successfully brought the feel of a 60s psychedelic record to the form of hip-hop, including the concept. Clocking in at roughly 34 minutes (as most 60s psychedelic records run), there is absolutely no wasted space. This is an album of epic proportions that rides the line of psychedelia and hip-hop cleaner than you can imagine. It's almost puzzling that a hip-hop record including heavy influence of The Beach Boys' ""Pet Sounds"", The Beatles' ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"", or Pink Floyd's ""Piper At The Gates Of Dawn"" would come off as such a cohesive set of gems. But it does, and Edan proves he's the man for the job.  The album's intro, ""Polite Meeting Intro"", starts it off with some music that could be from Sponge Bob Squarepants, then with the addition of trippy sound effects and vintage English vocal samples, we end up in The Beatles' ""Yellow Submarine"". It sets it off nicely. Then comes ""Funky Voltro"" featuring Insight, which includes a high-pitched swooping Minimoog played by Edan, and also a funky guitar sample. Then comes ""I See Colours"", a clear standout featuring a synthesizer played by Edan. Edan proves to have a impenetrable flow here, boasting some imaginative lyrics that work very well with the sweet atmospheric soundscapes and soothing 60s vocal and guitar samples. The next cut, ""Fumbling Over Words That Rhyme"", is also one of my favorites. Edan pays homage to some of the great innovators in hip-hop, including Run D.M.C., Grandmaster Flash Flash, Melle Mel, Kool Moe Dee, LL Cool J, Slick Rick, Nas and Ultramagnetic MC's among others. It seems that a lot of rappers tend to make an ""homage"" to old-school emcees, but Edan simply does it better by explaining ""why"" they were true innovators, which is much better in the eyes of this reviewer. ""Murder Mystery"" is a sweet track with some music similar to Jimi Hendrix's ""Are You Experienced"" with that reverse rhythm, then cuts in with instrumentation that sounds like it could be from the old ""Odd Couple"" tv show. The next cut, ""Torture Chamber"" featuring flows by Percee P, speeds things up with a dirtier beat, orchestra string arrangements, and a background Pink Floyd sample from ""Dark Side Of The Moon"". Then comes the best collaborative effort on the album; ""Making Planets"" featuring Mr. Lif. Lif was actually the one who turned me on to Edan, as he was featuring on Lif's ""Emergency Rations"" EP and his critically acclaimed ""I Phantom"". The production is especially creepy here, as Lif jumps in towards the end at the climax of the song. ""Time Out (Segue)"" is a tripped out interlude that blends perfectly to the next superior cut, ""Rock and Roll"" featuring Dagha. Which features some cool crunching guitars in it's very memorable production. I also love this lyric - ""My mental fabric / to big for Lenny Kravitz / Who imitates Jimi Hendrix in every facet"". ""Beauty"" is up next. This song is really one of my favorites. Like it's title, the soulful production is beautiful. The addictive reverse rhythm, tight drum loops, and soaring flute makes it a huge standout. I also love this lyric - ""I use pens like hallucinogens"". It mixes beautifully into ""The Science of the Two"" featuring Insight once again. This is another one of my favorites (it just keeps getting better as it goes). ""Smile"" is one of the trippier tracks on the album. He couldn't have closed out the album better, than with ""Promised Land"", definitely a standout. It's got a very memorable production, and some sick lyrical spitting from the one, the only, Edan.  I see some people complaining about the short run time (34 minutes). I on the other hand, think it's perfect. There is so much filler in today's hip-hop (underground included), that it's nice to have 13 powerful, memorable, carefully crafted tracks to concentrate on. I've spent most of my teen years listening to 60s and 70s psychedelic records, along with a wide array of classic rock, so it may be a bit more intriguing to me than the next hip-hop head, but this stuff is truly unique. Edan may have been paying tribute to hip-hop's greatest innovators lyrically, but he's also paid tribute to 60s and 70s psychedelia in one of the most memorable ways possible; through hip-hop"
5,"For whatever reason I bought this album much later on than the other two English Beat albums - something about it &quot;not being as good&quot;. That's complete nonsense. This album is excellent and it was a welcome revelation to hear it years later, after the fact as it were. There's not a weak track on this CD. Plenty of soulful saxophone solos abound. &quot;Dreamhome in NZ&quot;, &quot;Walk Away&quot;, and &quot;Monkey Murders&quot; are lost 80's classics to go along with the better-known &quot;Doors of Your Heart&quot; and &quot;Too Nice to Talk To&quot;. Love the alternate version of &quot;Get-A-Job&quot; found here. I rank this second Beat album in the all-too-short trilogy of albums from these guys right up there next to &quot;I Just Can't Stop It&quot;; it's certainly a stronger album from start to finish than &quot;Special Beat Service&quot; - their final album - where the strain of not having widespread commercial acceptance sounded like it had taken its toll. Looking back, I wish the English Beat had stayed together long enough to record a few more gems like &quot;Wha'ppen?&quot;. They probably do too"
4,"Though John Mayer is new to me, I have always liked the 'soft rock' genre. I got drawn in by the easy rock guitar selections, (especially 'Clarity') and listening to the lyrics came later.   John Mayer...easy on my ears. I'll try another CD. I think this music could grow on me."
2,"I'm a huge fan of pretty girls make graves. Their first two albums really rocked the joint. But I'm sorry to report that this album really doesn't add up. It just doesn't make much sense to me at all. There is none of that old magic which really made the other albums rock here!   instead they've gone for a really lazy, laid back style which doesn't hold yer interest. for example one song starts off with a crunchy rocking guitar riff, which sounds promising enough, but then it disappears and is replaced by a dull bass line and doesn't re-appear at all. They then get bored of the bass line and move on to something else at which point the song ends!! the whole album goes like that. Songs barely get going and then promptly end.  The second guitar play has disappeared to! which means you don't get that cool guitar interplay sound which defined their other albums ( I reckon he was the talented one). They've replaced 2nd guitar with a keyboard player who, i kid u not, puts samples of fireworks in one song!! (I've said enough)  C'mon people! lets have a bit of structure/effort/balls. I heard that andrea's vocals are shot n' the doc said she had to cool it down, so I can only assume they are trying to change their direction or something.. But they are heading in the direction of Dido or goldfrapp or something bad like that.   I've listened to the album about 12 times now and can honestly say not a single one really sticks out in my mind.. What d'you guys think about it?  I hope they get their acts together and recover from this droop.  It's like Henry Rollins Said ""If you aint gonna put 110% in don't even bother"" "
5,This was also a very influential Hip Hop album (Biggie Smalls)one of the best rappers ever classic album kane was the biggie of the 80's nobody could touch him
2,I only liked one song on the CD - all others were just average
5,"Veteran rocker Joe Grushecky is back with a new CD, entitled A Good Life. In an age where there's possible instant fame with TV shows and slick videos, Grushecky did it the old fashioned way: grinding it out in clubs and theatres over the years. Starting 25 years ago with his band, The Iron City Houserockers, Grushecky's always been part working class hero & part philosopher. It's a combination that has held up over time and this new CD is full of tunes that will make you think as well as crank up the stereo. Gary Borress, NY"
2,"I'm sure this won't win me any popular votes but, this musical is one that I feel I have to comment on. What has happened to Broadway? Why has London's West End taking over the musical theatre industry? Well, when Broadway produces musicals such as ""Little Women.""  As a fan of the book I had high hopes for the show expecting it to be as beautiful as ""The Secret Garden"" or ""Jane Eyre."" But, this musical does not enhance the book in fact it morphs it into some kind of mindless garbage.  The songs are mindless garbage with no feeling, depth, or emotion and listening to the CD is what one Broadway fan might consider torture. There are a few exceptions ""Take A Chance On Me"" and ""Small Umbrella In The Rain"" somehow manage to stand out but,are not enough to save this show from a slow death on Broadway.   The cast is dim witted and has little to no connection to the actual characters they are meant to play... Susan Foster who is well known as Millie does a decent job as Joe but, misses that magic sparkle and tom-boy nature that one would expect from the character Joe. Danny Gurwin- however makes a breakthrough apperance as Laurie seeming to be just about perfect and should have recieved a Tony nomination ... I can only hope he makes a few CDs after this show.  It's obvious why when you listen to ""Little Women""- how it came to die slowly and painfully on Broadway- the songs and the script lack the sentiments in the book- with no real love story... or perfect ending this musical is a truly tragic loss.  Made for the sole purpose of becoming a money maker knowing that fans of the book would stand by the show- the producers seemed to hope to make a quick buck. But, I will not stand by this show- their is something in the story that could be turned into a musical that fans could enjoy. All in all Broadway needs something more and fans need something else.."
5,"Does anyone know about if the second page of the lyrics book is supposed to have writing on it? I was looking through it and it looks as though somone actualy wrote in the golden box on the second page of my lyrics book. Its writen in a blue sparkly pen. Was wondering if Utada herself wrote it, cus it dosen't look like a computer did it. Anyway it says shishunki in kanji wich means puberty basicaly. I got the album in japan on a trip this week. Just wondering if anybody had any insite. Thanks. Oh and Yah this album rocks. Shes my favorite Jp artist"
2,...but every song on the album sounds the same. And I happen to like them. Disappointed
5,"For the money this cd is great.  Some good songs, #'s:1,2,8,9,10 and the NOFX song at the end is great.  Its definitelyworth the money. But if it were 13 bucks I would be so sur"
2,"ok i've listened to this album quite a few times and still have yet to find a strong point. i didn't get his first album so i'm not comparing like some reviewers may. ""on again tonight"" is the reason i   bought this album and it's one of the only songs i like on it. some people who really like this cd will say ""don't listen to him"". or something like that but i'm right. a few of these songs aren't very well written and just trail off. as far as his voice goes, even if he has range, his voice isn't very good. i mean i like his voice on ""beer man"" and ""on again to night"" but some of these songs his voice makes sound worse. although some songs are ok none are exactly good. if you don't have the new toby keith, little big town, gary allan, jason aldean, jamey johnson, or brad paisley album(to name a few) get one of those cause ALL of them are much better than this.  don't waste your money on it...i di"
1,"Hello, I think that Robin Gibb, this making the ridicule. That he sings their songs like soloist and don't try to imitate the voice of Barry. That it hurts that Robin, this destroying the great called myth: BEE GEES.      Armando Lobos      Chil"
5,"Riot Act should have won album of the year!  Although listening to the album 4 years after it was originally released, I am so glad I got back into Pearl Jam.  I have not listened to Pearl Jam since high school--I can't believe I deprived myself for so long!  Pearl Jam is the best rock band of my generation.  Hopefully, they will stick together and put out several more albums down the road.  For those of you not sure if Pearl Jam still has it, trust me THEY DO!!!  Buy this album, you will be in for a pleasant surprise..."
5,This is Najee at his best. I'm glad he's back and better than ever
2,"Around the turn of the century, record companies began to released one disc compilations that attempted to take artists with a ton of output and try to make an 80 minute attempt to capture the essentials. Needless to say, all of these attempts have failed. Great songs were overlooked, and instead of giving a quality overview of the band, one got instead the feeling of being ripped off. The Cure's Greatest Hits falls victim to the one disc overview.  A greatet hit album serves two purposes. One is to collect the best for fans who may desire to have many of their favorites on one album. The second is to provide new-comers to the band an overview of their career. The problem with The Cure is that they have released over 30 singles, and no single disc set can truly capture the best of their work.  For instance, how does a Cure best of ignore ""Pictures of You""? It would be akin to a Billy Joel best of leaving off ""The Stranger"". This song is considered one of the Cure's best, and leaving this off for stuff like ""The Walk"", ""High"", and ""Never Enough"" is an insult.  While ""Pictures of You"" is the biggest example of a song that is missing, there are plenty of other songs of lesser impact that still should have been on there. For instance, the sublime ""Catch"", the melancholy ""A Night Like This"", or even ""Jumping Someone Else's Train."" And what about their break-out single, ""Killing An Arab""?  The problem with this album is that it attempts to provide an overview of the Cure but instead only barely touches the surface. Leave this one on the CD racks and spend the extra money to get Staring at the Sea and Galore"
1,"OH PLEASE SAVE ME FROM THESE BOY BANDS. THERE ARE WAY TOO MANY BOYBANDS OUT NOW. AND WHO IS THE WORLD IS C-NOTE. THEY ARENT EVEN FAMOUS AND NOBODY EVEN KNOWS WHO THEY ARE. N-E-WAYS THEY DONT SOUND GOOD AT ALL AND IM GLAD I DIDNT WASTE MY MONEY BY BUYING THIS CD. SO IF YOU REALLY WANT TO LISTEN TO A BOY BAND GO AND LISTEN TO NSYNC, BACKSTREET BOYS, OR 98 DEGREES CAUSE AT LEAST THEY KNOW HOW TO SING"
2,"What they said was that Katy can't rock just yet because she's a raw talent and not yet coherent in theme.  I saw her live on the Chicks with Attitude tour with Liz Phair and the Cardigans and Charlotte Martin and Rose was the worst performer of the night.  The first problem is that her voice just isn't that strong, secondly, her lyrics never come out as if they're honest and as if they are always a pretension that people feel a cool girl growing up should say.  Throughout her set, there was only one song that stuck out as an interesting and unique thing (passingly honest as well) and that was ""Snowflake.""  It's fitting that the song was preceded by an ironic intro about how she's lived in California for a long time, but she hates warm weather, sounds impossible, but she must be truthful because it's the only song that breaks out of the leaden grunge guitar mix and hits the audience over the head with songcraft.  I'm sure she has potential for the future, but I think on her next album she should take a hint from Beth Orton who's known previous to her most recent album for being a popular artist in the realm of trip hop.  Stripping down your sound brings the utmost fundamentals of your idea and sound out, and I think that could be helpful for her to put on record"
5,"Wow, I just received ""Reiter In"" and am in agreement with other reviewers.  Chris Whitley has always been a favorite of mine, ever since the stunning debut of ""Living With the Law"".  I saw Chris on tour supporting that album in Seattle, on a double bill with Toad the Wet Sprocket.  The auditorium was packed with young Seattle suburbanites to see Toad, then when Chris took stage, half the place emptied out.  The faithful, knowing remainders witnessed a typical Chris show; searing, passionate, but also flawed and overly amplified.  Chris chain-smoked the entire show, and said little to the audience, but when I left I knew I'd seen an artist with no peer.  ""Reiter In"" is an amazing cd-probably for the first time, Chris sounds like part of a band and not just a phenomenal solo artist in front of backing musicians.  Although unpolished and recorded to analog, the band is cohesive, lending a jukejoint feel to Chris' guitar playing.  This music doesn't even directly compare to his previous stuff-it's got elements of Led Zeppelin/The Black Keys/""Achtung Baby"" U2, with some Depression era blues tossed in between.  Rather than annotating his impending death with dusty acoustic dirges, Chris gave us sweaty, soulful, life-affirming music, a most fitting end-note"
2,"Well, before buying this I had never even heard of bright eyes.  Just so you know my background, I generally dislike indie and Emo.  I usually listen to hardcore and Screamo.  But for some reason I became interested in this band.  (or person) Someone compared a CD of their's to A Death Cab CD.  Me being a pretty big Death Cab fan, I decided to go out and buy this EP to see if I liked this band at all.  This review is the result of that listen.  The EP opens up with the slow acoustic guitar picks of ""a line allows prgress""...  A few seconds into the song I am greeted with with drums and an organ.  This song sounds like a slower Cursive song.  The guy's voice sounds decent.  I guess the vocal effects he uses are for emotional purposes.  Overall this is a pretty decent song.  It reminds me of hotel california.  Next in line comes one of my favorite tracks on here:  ""a perfect sonnet"".  I don't know if it's the simple guitar stum or the sense that his voice is going to explode any moment.  Seriously, the whole song I was thinking that everything was about to fall apart...but it didn't.  He keeps going and going.  It must be his voice that creates this mood.  This was also the point of the CD where I realized that it was a bit more than music I was listening to.  Bright eyes will make you feel moods that other music can't.  It's got a unique brand of emotion that is new to me.  It's too bad this song ends so quickly.  As I press on to: ""on my way to work"" I begin to get the feel for the CD.  He's almost whispering on this track.  There's an odd sounding guitar picking and a country sounding synthesizer.  Quite frankly, I hate this song.  It sounds like an offkey country ballad...  Who wants that?  The next two tracks are more or less the same feel.  A new arrangement provides better quality music than the craptastic on my way to work, but doesn't reach the level of A perfect sonnet.  Finally, the EP is ended with the techno atmospheric: Neely o hara...  I don't know what to say.  It's meaningless.  I don't see how you can like this.  It's just pointless.  Overall this is a half and half EP.  The first two tracks are good...  But the rest of the CD falls between failing and decent.  If Bright Eyes good churn out more tracks like a perfect sonnet, this band would get at least a 4 star.  Sadly thats not the case.  So I don't recommend this for anyone other than the really dedicated fans.  Perhaps the other CD's are better"
5,"This ain't your Dad's Santana. Named for original Fleetwood Mac guitarist Peter Green's breathtaking blues instrumental (he also composed BLACK MAGIC WOMAN), here's the album that rescued the entirely deserving Carlos Santana from endless classic rock tour pergatory. Not since Tina Turner's ""I've still got legs"" comeback in the 80s has the music world witnessed such an unexpected and satisfying resurrection, thanks to the ingenious pairing of Mexico's guitar guru with a half dozen young disciples, and Eric Clapton tacked on for good measure. SMOOTH, the funky, blistering Rob Thomas collaboration that knocked doldrums-drenched radio on its keister at the turn of the century was the catylist, culminating in the Grammy's most decorated album ever (take THAT, Michael). Since Carlos Santana has always utilized a variety of vocalists (from Journey's Gregg Rolie to Buddy Miles to John Lee Hooker) and musical styles, hearing him play rock, hip-hop and jazz in tandem with everyone from Lauryn (Where'd she go, anyhoo?) Hill to Dave Matthews to Everlast is not such a far fetched notion.  MARIA MARIA even has the Product G&B extolling the virtues of ""Carlos Santana"" by name in their slniky groove-enriched rap. On the strictly Spanish-speaking side, CORAZON ESPINADO (featuring Mana) sounds infectious in ANY language, and the rest is the vintage Latino rock that this cat was blowin' light years before Ricky Martin was even a Menudo. When the musical history books are written, SUPERNATURAL will remain proof positive that, yes Virginia, there really IS a Santana claus. RATING: FIVE FIESTAS"
5,"I have seen the movie and bought the sound track. Having marinated my bones and psyche with Tibetans for over 25 years this soundtrack unites two ostensiby disparate cultures, America and Mongolia. As music is the one art form that transcends cultures, it is intersteing to hear the Blues united with their Asian cousins. The phenomenon of throat singing is what you have heard in Tibetan Monks chanting with the  ability to produce two tones simultaneously. Paul Pena, a black,  blind, blues singer from California, copped their gig and taught  himself how to do this. He went to Tuva and won their annual throat singing contest in his category. It is an exposure of the  roots. Like Mongolians don't get the Blues. For any armchair anthropoligist, this cd is a must. The movie will make you cry as you see the challenges that Paul faces, distantly empowered by the deceased physicist, Richard Feinman, who went to Tuva on his  last journey. Paul's trip is peppered with stickers that they  paste up, &quot; Feinman Lives&quot; Feinman was a great thinker from Far Rockaway, N.Y. who collected stamps from Tuva as a child. This record is strange and profound. Irresistable for any thinking person"
1,"... this is a subtle tip off that this album is not worth buying. Not for more than fifty cents.  Like I said, the ONLY good song on here is the Rolling Stones cover ""I'm Free"". And I even like The Soup Dragons' rendition better than the Stones' original. But the fact remains that the rest of this album is a dull drudgery of a mess to get through. This album is practically a single for ""I'm Free"", but with twelve extra songs of filler you'll never listen to more than once (if at all). Hmmm. What else can I say about ""I'm Free""? Oh, yea... the music video for the song is quite awesome. Its so trippy and tie-dyed out! But that still doesn't change my review. Or stoic state of mind.  One star out of five"
5,"Very nice CD, quite different from their other ones but quickly became my favorite"
5,"""Morning View"" in my opinion is the most different album by Incubus.  Their traditional sound lies within rock, hard rock, etc.  But this album is the one with the most chilled-out songs on it.  That is one of the reasons for this being my favorite Incubus album: its originality.    Mind you...if you like this album, don't attain the mindset of ""omg if I like this one I'll like their other albums too!""  It doesn't work that way; Incubus' other releases are nothing like this, with the exception of a few songs.  And now...let's move on to the song review.  Nice to Know You--A nice opening song.  I like the lyrics a lot, and the constant transission between heavy rock and slow beats gives the song a good rhythm.  8.5/10  Circles--Probably the one song on ""Morning View"" that is most like Incubus' other albums.  The guitar in the background is especially cool.  The chorus is also nice, and the lyrics really stay true to the song title.  8/10  Wish You Were Here--My favorite song on this CD by far.  The guitar riffs in this song are the greatest on the whole album.  The chorus is also very amazing, and so are the lyrics.  Quite possibly a perfect song.  10/10  Just a Phase--Probably the song with the mose meaningful lyrics on the album.  It starts off as an easy-going song with no lyrics and a catchy, steady beat and then is joined by powerful lyrics that have to do with going through a typical phase and how annoying it is to go through something like that.  9/10  11 A.M.--A song with a mixture of Incubus' rock and the slow beats on this CD.  This track acts as a bridge between the other albums and this album, in my opinion.  8.5/10  Blood on the Ground--Like Circles, this track is like Incubus' songs from other albums.  Not only that, but this song's lyrics are meaningful as well.  It portrays getting in fights, but not saying anything to the other person (hence ""Blood in my mouth beats blood on the ground"").  8/10  Mexico--The slowest song on here by far.  This is such a big step for incubus, because as far as I can tell, they have never done anything like this before.  This is why they are such an excellent band: they take risks by exploring other genres, and they do a good job at it too.  8.5/10  Warning--My second favorite track on the whole album.  I dunno why, but it is excellent.  The vocals and lyrics are the best here.  Especially the nice-sounding bit in which the vocals go ""We'll make millions writing a book on the way it should have been.""  Parts of this song like this one portray a great range in the vocals, which is why this is such a great song.  9.5/10  Echo--My favorite slow song.  The vocals sound very nice, especially the chorus.  The chorus alone is a reason to listen to this track over and over again.  9/10  Have you Ever--Not one of my personal favorites, but still a good track.  It resembles a lot of other Incubus songs on the other albums as well.  This song is basically about putting yourself in someone else's position before you judge them.  8/10  Are You In?--The most  pop-like song on the album.  I was surprised and happy to hear this song.  Again: Incubus is awesome at experimenting with new songs, and I must say, this one came out nicely.  9/10  Under my Umbrella--Also a lot like their other songs on albums such as ""Make Yourself.""  But the beginning vocals (""When I close my eyes..."") sound awesome, and so does the main singing.  Overall, a good track.  8.5/10  Aqueous Transmission--The most UNIQUE song ever done by Incubus EVER.  It includes instruments they've never used before, such as a Japanese flute.  It has a ""Crouching-Tiger, Hidden-Dragon"" feel to it, and it is enjoyable even for the sole reason that it is different from the rest of the songs.  The vocals are also great.  9/10  OVERALL score: 5 stars.  This is definitely the most unique, most laid-back album by Incubus.  It shows a lot of very successful experimentation as well.  I dunno what all this ""selling out"" talk is, but you should definitely buy this album.  It is much different from the other albums, and still manages to be one of Incubus' best albums"
1,"The Ying Yang Twins are so bad that it is not even funny. Now if they had talent then I could buy this CD, but that is not the case.."
4,"I had lost track of Steve Vai for a while....In the early 90's I bought ""Passion and Warfare""(an instant classic!!)but I did not buy anything after that, cause I just felt so good with Passion and Warfare that I didn't want to be let down by his next releases. Deep inside, I must have thoght that might happen... Well resently I stopped by sony's website, and I fell in love with the sound clips for this CD. I bought it, and I have been enchanted ever since! It's a different CD, but no disapointments. Some fans don't like Steve's singing, but what he sings here is ok. It won't hurt. This is a statement, and I can't wait to hear part 2 and 3 when they are released"
2,"I was given this CD from my sister, who knows I love to dig into up and coming bands.  I was not impressed.  The only song I found to be fairly original, in at least the sound, was In the Woods, which I wouldn't list as the fulcrum this album turns on.  The remainder of this album disappointed me with its appeal to emotion that was trying a little too hard (as is the style these days), hammering out repeated chords and vocals that have that familiar deep delicate sound.  Now, I don't like Coldplay.  I don't have any of their albums.  I hate to say this, but it almost sounds like Levy is really trying to pull off some Coldplay covers.  Make sure you listen to the samples before you buy this CD, because I'd hate for someone to accidently buy A Rush of Blood to the Head Part II."
4,"Ok, I got this CD about year ago or something, and never got the chance to write a review about it. She is a really good singer, and that's really good for a girl at such a young age. The first song I ever heard by her was ""Leave (get out)"" and I liked it a little bit then, but now I really like it! She may be a little too young to sing what she sings about, but the songs are still really good! Well, here it is:  1. Breezy - 10/10 A really interesting and creative beginning to the album! She uses loud vocals in this song, too, which makes it stand out a lot.  2. Baby it's you - 10/10 A great single! This song is very sweet, and is pretty easy to understand in some parts.  3. Not that kinda girl - 10/10 This is one of her latest singles on her CD, and it's a very nice song! In this song she basically talks about what she is and what she isn't, and I really like music that does that sort of stuff.  4. The happy song - 8/10 This one is ok, but not my favorite. The tune is a little too orignal in my opinion, but the lyrics are pretty good.  5. Homeboy - 10/10 Great song, although I never really liked the word ""homeboy"". But, the tune is very familiar and very pretty.  6. City lights - 7.5/10 This one isn't that great, particularly because of the guys that come up some point in this song and start to rap. It just sounds a little werid, and I never liked rap.  7. Leave (Get out) - 10/10 Awesome single! It's one of the only songs on here that stands out, and it's great to dance to! The music video is pretty cool too, check it out!  8. Use my shoulder - 7/10 Ok, I think she could've picked a better chorus tune than this one, cuz this one was just annoying and boring. But as always, the lyrics are good.  9. Never say goodbye - 10/10 Beautiful! This tune is VERY familiar! It sounds to me like she did a remake of it or something, cuz it's got a beautiful tune and beautiful lyrics. This song can also be used as a lullaby to put someone to sleep. :-P  10. Weak - 6/10 UGH! This song is just soooooooo long and boring! Although the lyrics are always good, this song is just too original.  11. Keep on Keepin' on - 9/10 This is the first song on this ablum that's written by JoJo herself! She did a great job on it, too. The lyrics are just so true!  12. Sunshine - 9/10 Another song that she wrote, and it's just as good. I like the tune also, it's very nice.  13. Yes or no - 9/10 This is a good one too, and another one that she wrote (along with others, of course). I really like the beginning, it's one of those beginnings you would'nt expect in a song lol.  14. Fairy Tales - 7/10 I guess this is a nice ending, but the song itself isn't too great. I'm sure she could've made a better tune than this boring one. I'm into pop and energetic music, not usually slow songs like this!  Overall, cool CD. If you've heard any of JoJo's music, I'm sure you'd like her album. Also, keep and eye out for her new album titled ""The high road"" coming out on October 17th! I can't wait to get it myself, especially after hearing her cool new song, ""Too little too late"""
1,"I would say get this for the Song tommorow by Saif keta but the One song if you Watch the Flim very Closly was when Ali and his brother paid Jamie Fox a visit in the Hotel and Ali riding on the Train  , That Track was By Johnny Farmer a Old school Blues song Called Death Letter , with Great vocals this song is not on Soundtrack ""why? It is the best song in the whole damn Movie  I wonder where I can get it like it was song in the Movie ? if you know let me know "
5,"I don't have much to add.  If you love Seger, get this CD.  LOVE IT"
1,"I cannot imagine what Sony or their sad, sad technicians were thinking - or NOT thinking when they ""remastered"" this great musical.  I HOPE - and one can only hope - whomever it was that ""remastered"" this music (and I can't imagine why they would call it re-MASTERED) that they got FIRED afterwards or went back to basic recording school.  MASTERING a musical CD means that you check your levels and balance - something they either forgot to do or were too busy talking while they should have been listening to what they were doing.  Did Sony imagine they'd be able to sell this on it's own merits...that being an attractive, well known, sell-able music CD of a charming musical - while duping the buying public (sadly ME included) that it would be something worth having for any Broadway music collection??  Well I was most assuredly fooled.  Even with my cheap (Sony by the way) 2 track tape deck could have come up with better than this rendition.  I just cannot abide that some highly technical ""master"" of recording equipment couldn't fix this before the thing was committed to a glass cd master to be cut in quantity, offered and distributed as a ""remastered"" version that SHOULD have been BETTER than the original but sadly isn't even close.  I thankfully, still have a cassette tape version of this musical from when it was first released many years ago and prefer that to this impossible display of cd ""mastering"" I have EVER heard - and I've heard a lot of quality remastered CD's - but this isn't one of them.  THE ONLY saving grace of this CD is some of the extras that have been included.  But not at full price..if you ask me.  Think twice or at least understand at the outset what you're getting....a very poorly ""rekindled - NOT remastered"" CD that has some singers sounding as if the ""technicians"" forgot to bring up the volume on those tracks.  Pretty sad, pretty sad.  Disappointing.  Love the musical - HATE the lousy CD"
4,"A recent Rolling Stone issue listed the 100 greatest guitarists and omitted this fine(probably 1 of 10 or so, blues greats) performer. Though it is hard to be totally objective as I have both seen and met this great guy on a few occasions, there really is no one who plays as well or has this TONE. He is a fantastic blues and jazz virtuoso, and is certainly headed for greater recognition. I prefer his own writing and that is what kept me from giving this 5 stars as there are a couple of covers included here that are not of the same caliber. Thank you, Robben for another very good recording/perfomance"
1,"32 years ago I was so stoked that Clapton was finally coming out with a new album, I walked five miles to Deorsey's Records in Lewiston, Maine the day that it was released to buy this much anticipated record. The still near virgin vinyl remains in my LP collection and has only been played once. Once was enough. Heroin robbed a true master of his creativeness, inspiration and technical ability. Sad."
2,"Watched the movie on DVD, loved it so much I immediately got on-line and bought the soundtrack.  One of the things I liked about the movie is the juxtaposition of ballroom music and hiphop.  The soundtrack for this movie about ballroom dancing does not have a single track of the ballroom music on it!  What's up with that?"
5,"First my review:  The recorded legacy of MJH falls into roughly five categories.   (1) his early 1928 recordings on the OKEH label which comprise around 20 tracks. Although they are quite listenable and of historical interest and importance they are not the most enjoyable of his recordings. (2) recordings from 1963 that are available on the Rounder label. The sound quality of these recordings is somewhat disappointing. For that reason alone I don't listen to them much except for the fact that they were heavily relied upon by people who transcribed his songs for instructional materials. (3) The Library of Congress recordings (also from 1963). These are perhaps the best. The sound quality is excellent and there is an informality to the sessions which makes it like having MJH as a house guest for the weekend determined to play you every song he knows. (4) The (these) Vanguard Recordings, which I think were recorded between 1967 and 1969. These rival and sometimes surpass the Library of Congress Recordings as far as the material goes. There is also a palpable sadness as you can detect a man near the end of his life aware of the fact that he may very well be making his final recordings. The audio engineers did a terrible job at Vanguard for a good deal of these recordings. How can you screw up recording just one guy with a guitar? If you try hard enough you can set the levels WAY off. That is how. (5) there is also a Live MJH CD from Vanguard. It's sound quality is pretty good and it is endearing to hear MJH talk to an audience, but I find it less compelling material wise than the studio recordings.  Listening to MJH makes you want to piick up the guitar and learn to play like him. The good thing about this is that if you really want to you probably can. Many of his songs have been transcribed and broken down in intructional books and DVDs. After going through a ""beginning fingerpicking"" DVD by Stefan Grossman you are probably ready to take on MJH.  Go for it!  And now for my question:  It's not obvious to me from the Vanguard website whether the boxed set is actually a newer digital remaster than the original digital re-masters from the mid 80s. As far as digital remasters go those ones were a bit of a disaster. When you put the disc into your player you would have to crank the volume on your stereo. As you might expect, the careless lack of attention to levels setting in the remastering process resulted in a mushy sounding guitar. I seem to remember that was also a problem with the vinyl Vanguard LPs, particularly the first one. Hopefully these CDs really  are *new* remasters because most CDs re-mastered these days are remastered quite well.  My music management software for encoding MP3s has the capability of looking up CDs in an online database. Whenever I present it with copies of the old mid 1980s vanguard CDs it recognizes them as possibly being from the boxed set, so I hesitate to spring for the ""new remasters"" without really knowing if they are indeed recently remastered. Perhaps someone else could clear this up"
5,"It continues to amaze me to find ""new"" musicians who record in bedroom studios all across the country. Everyone was amazed when Craig Chaquico pulled this off, Roger takes it to the next level. The closest event I can recall to this release is Steely Dan's 1972 ""Can't Buy a Thrill"" that put pop/rock on its ear. The influences are many and varied...Beach Boys, Beatles, Osmonds, Neil Sedaka, Jimmy Webb, The Who, Styx, Yes, Chicago, Alan Parsons, ELO/Jeff Lynn, Astrud Giberto, Wondermints, Burt Bacharach, Supertramp, 60's Brit Pop, the list goes on... As for Roger's vocal ability, he's no Bocelli, but he is better than 90% of the front men out there.  He has a unique ""honey"" styled voice with a smoothness not often heard these days (think Joseph Williams, David Pack, Donnie Osmond, Gerry Beckley).  He doesn't try to imitate anyone, and has learned to be comfortable using his instrument as intended and well trained.  Primarily a keyboardist, his chops on guitars and drums are commendable as well.  Can't think of enough good things to say about this artist.  Not every cut is excellent, but eight of eleven are standouts and addictive.  The three deleted cuts from Solid State Warrior make for eleven very strong songs that could all be at home on the top 40...during some point of time. Buy this CD Now"
5,"If this music doesn't make you get out of your chair, nothing will!  Not only are the CDs filled with big hits, but even the less widely known tunes will get your heart pounding.  Great for reminiscing, great for exercising, great for making work go faster...just GREAT"
1,"If you're not anal about sound quality then please skip this review.   That said, this DTS disc sounds terrible. Why?   1- If you're even vaguely familiar with this album or the songs, you will hardly recognize them here. The multi-channel mix is way out of phase from the original stereo mix; in other words, they sound totally different from each other.   2- This disc doesn't have the fidelity of the SONY re-mastered Abraxas. The tape hiss is very noticeable, and the overall sound is very dull. Just compare this disc with the newer re-mastered version and you will hear the difference immediatley.  Save your money and ""maybe"" someday SONY will release a multi-channel SACD from the same source as the rather excellent re-mastered cd"

4,"I loved this musical when I went to see it in late March of 2006. But unforutunately the only reason why I didn't give this 5 stars is because this soundtrack doesn't have exactly what I saw on stage, and I loved that better. This is an awesome soundtrack though.  When I went to see this musical, only 3 members of the original cast were still on the play: Norbert Leo Butz as ""Freddy,"" Joanna Gleason as ""Muriel,"" and Gregory Jbara as ""Andre."" But, that night I went to see it, Gergory Jbara was substituted by Dennis Parlato, so I really only saw 2 original cast members.  Normally when you see a musical on stage or on film for the first time, you don't really get the ""entire"" taste of the music part because you have to concentrate on the story, the characters, and what's going on and what you're looking at. Sometimes its even hard to remember the music you heard until you listen to it again without visual aid, unless the performance of the songs were very memorable. And the song that really stuck out here was Norbert's performance of ""Great Big Stuff."" His physical comedy and every single word rang with crass wit that was over the top and just begs you for more. Norbert Leo Butz plays ""Freddy Benson"" by the way.  When I saw the play, Johnathan Pryce was playing the part of ""Laurence Jameson."" And Pryce is an actual British person, which kind of made his role more believable. His voice really fit the part. John Lithgow at times appears to lose his accent in the soundtrack. John Lithgow isn't bad for the part though, and when he has to impersonate an Austrian Doctor, he does an over the top job.   Dennis Parlato (Jbara's substitute) I believe did a better job at playing a Frenchman. His accent seemed less forced than Gregory's here. Gregory brings a much more ""snooty"" personality to Andre than Dennis did. Maybe that's what was originally intended perhaps.  Mylinda Hall played Jolene Oaks when I saw it, and in my opinion she did a far more fantastic job than Sara Gettelfinger. Sara sounds a bit too ""mature"" and a little older too. Jolene is supposed to be young, dumb, and full of fun!  Now Sherie Rene Scott does a fantastic job at playing ""Christine Colgate"" and better than Rachel York, the girl I saw. Rachel York was good, but Sherie does a good job at being a ditz, like Christine is supposed to be. She hits those high notes with ease and gives a nice flair of innocence in her role.  ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"" is a great musical adaptation to a movie, and I believe that you can buy the soundtrack before seeing the play but vice versa. However, if you are listening to the soundtrack before seeing the play, you better take ""A Message from John Lithgow"" very seriously because you won't enjoy the play as much if you see it after listening to the soundtrack. So do what John Lithgow says!  "
1,"No melody, no rhythm; just noise. I'm heading to the used CD store with it as soon as I can. I'd rate it zero stars if I coul"
5,"Musical genius to the limit. It Ain't No Use it the most beautiful song ever written - I have listened to this over and over and over again for years, and will continue to do so."
1,"Led Zeppelin were simply the most overrated band of all time who were just as bad as NIRVANA and ACDC. They only made about a decent song in ""Stairway To Heaven"". Rest of the songs just STINK!!! Plant sounds more like a big monkey than a real singer and can't sing at all, HE JUST SCREAMS. Like good singers??????? I recommend go with Foreigner, Dire Straits who were equally the greatest bands with the greatest singers in LOU GRAMM, and MARK KNOPFLER. They are a billion times better than LED ZEPPELIN. Don't listen to the five star reviewers of this page, avoid this piece of junk and go with Foreigner insted. They are legends, not ZEPPELIN!!"
5,"""Hey hey mama, said the way you move, Gonna make you sweat gonna mak you groove..."" is the opening line to an epic album if there ever was one.  I can not imagine how to sit down and write a song like a Led Zepplin song. To create a song with the charge of ""Rock and Roll"", or the lyrics to ""Battle of Evermore"", to create something like these epic songs is something that beyond me; and as for ""Stairway"" I think that's beyond any of us mortals. The popular ""Stairway"" had a seemingly unreal start when one day Robert Plant had a pencil and paper and Jimmy Page was just strumming when Plant described it as ""my hand just started writing out the words. I just sat there and looked at them and almost leapt out of my seat."" The song has gone on to capture immortality in the music world and is the most frequently played song in American history, which is pretty good seeing how it was never released as an actual single. But it is not just a Zepplin CD with ""stairway"" on it. It is has so much to offer in every track.  I have grown up with these songs, and if you've ever seen a Ford commercial or just listened to the radio, chances are that you have had these songs in your head one way or another even if you don't know who Led Zepplin is. But the one song that has always unrightfully gone in the shadows of ""Stairway"" is ""When the Levee Breaks"". I always personally found ""Levee"" as the strongest song in Zoso; but i dare not compare two songs of their caliber. But ""Levee"" brings this epic Album to an extraordinary close. After every listen, I find it hard to believe that there is only Eight tracks, because it sucks you into a world of enormous sound and mystery, and after you have listened to ZOSO whether it be the first time or if it's been too many to count, it leaves you with a sense that you have heard something special, done by a band with a sound that is larger than life.   Essential Recording. No exceptions"
1,"This is one of the seminal albums of the Two-Tone movement, but don't buy this castrated version"
1,"Like almost all rock bands to have formed within the past 10 years, 3 Doors Down is disposable, all their songs sound dull and boring (their all the same too), they belong in the same category as Creed and Nickelback in the ""Lullaby Rock"" subgenre. It's this kind of stuff, along with emo, Limp Bizkit, and ICP, that is killing rock"
2,"Ya know, when i heard that mobb deep signed to g-unit i was MORE suprised that 50 cent was ACTUALLY familiar with a group as great as Mobb Deep. I didn't even think 50 knew mobb deep existed let a lone that they were legends in new york. I mean i know 50's from nyc but think about it....new york IS one of the top 10 most populated cities in the WORLD. N-e-wayz....yo this CD is definately different from their earlier works on ""hell on earth"" and ""the infamous"" albums. But just because it's different doesn't mean that i'm impressed. Obviously, mobb deep is tired of rapping about things that are real where they grew up and they've given up by signing with 50 to make more money. I mean....it's all on their titles on the list of songs. Does this all mean that their sellouts? Well....considering i'm a mean critic of true underground hip hop music...I'm really not sure. Every artist/groups have different intentions. I mean...with a group as big as this...maybe theres a motive to their madness??? I'm trying to look at this from different points of views. Mobb Deep HAS been doing it a long time and all throughout the east coast and new york they ARE considered veterans of this game. Doing it since what...1993 right?? I honestly think that their trying to win brand new fans of the mainstream/commercial rap radio listeners. I think once they have new fans they will blow up and come back with the rawness that they had on the HELL ON EARTH album. We may have to wait until their 3rd album or so from G-unit. But hey, i could be wrong and maybe their just submitting their careers to 50, i dunno. Nonetheless....compared to their earlier releases this album is pure garbage. I agree with one of the kid reviewers that prodigy is trying to sound like 50. I suggest you just download or burn a few songs from this CD instead of buying the whole thing. There are no more than 5 good songs on this album. Oh yeah and the album gets better at the end. Too bad they wasted their songs as radio hit singles. Peace"
5,"I was very lucky to have seen Cat Stevens during the Majikat tour in 1976.  Since then I have always wanted to have a way to recapture the memories of that great concert.  The DVD and this CD of the Majikat tour are perfect!  Outstanding sound quality, great songs passionately performed.  For those who have Cat's CDs, this is a wonderful addition to your collection. For those just getting into Cat's music, a great way to see and hear the ""majik"" of his music.  Outstanding!!!"
1,I wouldn't mind writing a review on Riverdance but as of yet I haven't received it. It was ordered 8-16 and as of 10-22 I have not gotten it yet. Is this normal
5,I once owned this CD and some how lost or misplaced it. My CD player has not been the same without it. I plan to purchase another of it ASA
2,"An album of outtakes and rarities is an odd thing.  Obviously, the songs weren't good enough to make the album they were originally intended for.  Either that or the artist felt they didn't fit right.  So how does one go about grading an album of this type?  It's not easy.  Graded as a stand-alone album on its own merits, I'd give this one a single star.  Marked by inconsistencies and a lack of flow, it's a poor effort that starts out extremely strong and ends gasping for breath.  Graded as a complementary album to ""Illinois,"" however, I'd give it three stars.  I can understand why the songs weren't used and find several of them worth repeated listening.  If i could give half stars, this album would get 1.5 simply because of the overwhelming length.  The respective lengths of ""Illinois"" and ""Michigan"" weren't an issue as the albums both contained an overwhelming amount of good tracks.  A compilation like this of rarities and b-sides would have been better served as a 35-40 minute production rather than the 75-minute opus this package is"
5,"An excellent album. I am a fan of ""I Can Hear The Heart Beating"" and ""Then NOthing Turned Into Somethin"". This cd is entirely different. Yo La Tengo pulls a complete 180, and sticks mainly to covers mixed with some original stuff. It has a misty, thematic feel to it, a certain aura of perfectly arranged acoustic guitar and slippery vocals. ""What Comes Next"" evokes the Byrds, especially their ""Notorious Byrd Bros."" phase. An excellent buy, sit back n enjoy"
5,"Joan Rivers is an American original and this CD captures her at her peak.  Clever, brilliant, brash, outrageous, controversial, Joan was ahead of her time but stays timelessly hilarious on this CD.  If you like Joan, you absolutely must get this - I am so grateful to have found it on Amazon.com!  I originally heard this &quot;album&quot; when it came out in the early '80s and have loved it ever since.  Joan rules!"
5,"Bob Dylan and Daniel Lanois work better together, it seems to me, then many of the other people Dylan has worked with. I certainly like the sound of this record better than the stuff Dylan did with Tom Petty, though I like that stuff too. I actually like this record as much as I like ""Blood on the Tracks"" and often have both of them in my CD changer at the same time (which by the way I never set at random play with a Bob Dylan record, because Dylan records were meant to be played in their entirety, the way Dylan presented them). For me, this record fits nicely between ""Tracks"" and ""Time out of Mind."" Sure he did some great stuff in between, but it's these personal songs like ""What Good Am I?"" that I like so much and, of course, the way Bob Dylan tells a story. There is nobody better"
5,"I really loved this CD.  I am not normally a fan of classical music, but this is more like a pop cd.  Andrea's duets are absolutely fabulous.  You forget you are listening to what is classified as classical.  It is very enjoyable & I suggest all Andrea fans get this one, but they probably already have.  Hopefully with this CD, Andrea's music will be introduced to people who are pop fans & they will start to buy his music & become a fan, as I have"
1,...to the frank passion and energy of her first release.  This is pretentious drivel.  Some call it more mature; I find it nearly unlistenable
5,"Bone's first official release (not counting the rare and hard to find ""B.O.N.E. Enterprise"" album from 92 or 93). Classic, not much more to say, even though it's only 5 songs, they're all classics or damn good songs. With all 5 members on here, Flesh was still around, you get the beginning to one of the best groups ever in rap, and in their prime, as what they did was something new and orioginal and everone loved it. Production is insane, like on E.1999, and mostly handled by the great DJ Uneek, who's beats fit them so well, and some help from Yella. A must have album   #3 - 10 (CLASSIC their first big song -- great beat)  #4 - 9 (tight beat)  #5 - 9.5 (tight beat)  #6 - 8.5  #7 - 10 (CLASSIC -- f/ Eazy E)   KRAYZIE -- Anthony Henderson -- b. 6/3/74 -- Cleveland, OH  BIZZY -- Bryon Anthony McCane -- b. 9/12/76 -- b. Columbus, OH; Cleveland, OH  LAYZIE -- Steven Howse -- b. 9/23/75 -- Cleveland, OH  WISH -- Charles Scruggs -- b. 2/17/75 -- Cleveland, OH  FLESH -- Stanley Vernell Howse -- b. 6/10/73 -- Cleveland, OH   BONE THUGS!!!!!  check all my review"
2,"If you want a good Hank 3 album, go with Lovesick Broke & Driftin'. It's a more impressive and mature work than this one, which seems slapped together and unoriginal.   The best songs on Risin' Outlaw are the three written by Wayne Hancock, who himself has a delivery and style eerily similar to Hank Sr. So what you end up with on this disc is Hank 3 imitating Wayne Hancock imitating Hank Williams, Sr. And since Wayne Hancock is a better singer and songwriter to begin with, and his performances of his own songs are better than Hank 3's, why not just get the original Hancock CDs? The cover of ""Thunderstorms and Neon Signs"" on Risin' Outlaw seems particularly pointless, as Hank 3 uses an identical delivery, launching into falsettos at the same time, holding certain notes the same way, etc. I can understand why someone would want to cover it--it's a beautiful song--but at least add *something* of your own to it. To use an art analogy, it's like Hank 3 is tracing over a drawing that Wayne Hancock made, but it is apparent that Hank 3 isn't as good of an artist.   Having said this, Risin' Outlaw is still better than 99% of the trash played on country radio. But I think that speaks more to the horrible quality of contemporary country music than it does to the quality of this particular album. Still, if you get the chance to see Hank 3 play live, don't miss it"
4,"I was upset to not be able to find any information on Philipa Williams. I love the song ""Look in the mirror"" and was sorry that it was not on the soundtrack. Although the soundtrack was nice I was left hanging looking for more. Where can I find this song?????????????????"
1,"...then so is ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"". Except that's not entirely fair: ""Rocky Horror"" rocks harder"
5,"This is a great album, my favourite.  Let's Go to Tahiti, Friday,Thirteen Days, Don't Cry Sister, Sensitive Kind.  This was made for CD, 15 years to  early.  Okay I like JJ,but this to me is the peak.  And Eric Clapton hasn't  covered a single track of this"
2,"Kasey's foray into the pop genre doesn't really bother me, and she certainly isn't selling-out either.This release however just doesn't have the same quality of songwriting that her three previous country/roots discs had. Not much more to say exept that this, along with Allison Moorer, & Randy Rogers Band are my 3 biggest let-downs of this year"
5,"I have no idea what people are thinking here. This is one of Wendy and Lisa's strongest albums aside from Eroica. Maybe people just aren't into listening to Lisa sing, since she does most of the vocals for this album. However, I am a huge fan of Lisa, and any time I can get the opportunity to hear her sing, I cherish it. I think she has a marvelous and very sweet voice.    Some people have cited their first album was much stronger, but I disagree. The first album was way to &quot;pop-ish&quot; for my tastes, and they hadn't really come into their own yet. It just didn't have the depth of Eroica or Girl Bros. Waterfall was OK, but it has nothing on &quot;I've Got No Strings&quot;, &quot;Bring You Back&quot;, or &quot;I've Got a Big Bowl of Cherries&quot;.    And for the people complaining about Jonathan's death hanging too much over this album, this album was ALL ABOUT Jonathan's death! The whole reason they wrote the thing was part of their grieving process. The album is DEDICATED to him! Get a clue!    To the reviewer ragging on the hidden track: That's deidcated to Trevor Horn, who screwed the girls over when he was producing (or more accurately, supposed to be producing) their album &quot;Friendly Fire&quot;. He put it off for six years and then sucked the life out of it when he finally finished it and gave it back to them, rendering it a completely unplayable piece. (Lisa said it sounded like &quot;an Italian coffee table&quot; after he got through with it.) They didn't just throw that track in to be trendy or something, you know. If you're going to do a review, at least get your history and your facts straight. For the record, I like the hidden track, with its &quot;delta blues&quot; sound, and the lyrics are pretty scathing.     So anyway, don't listen to these other yahoos here saying that GB isn't all that good. They're wrong. Girl bros is a GREAT album. Definitely one of their top ones. Tchad Blake did a great job on production, and the track lineup is varied and engaging. Every song has great depth and excellent melody"

1,"I bought this album determined not to pay attention to any negative reviews from this site or any other. I have never been proven so wrong in my life. This album is inexcusably bad. Ths following review sums it up exactly.  21 of 36 people found the following review helpful:   Deplorable......!, September 20, 2005 Reviewer: Brendan ""Bren"" (New York) - See all my reviews  Whoever is the creative genius behind this miss matched MESS of a tribute should be fired immediately from whatever label or organization commissioned this album. Nostalgia aside, never have I heard such an amazing, talented group of performers (some of them amongst my favourites - Aretha Franklin, Beyonce, Stevie Wonder, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Patti LaBelle, Angie Stone) sound so unprepared, vocally dull, poorly produced and karaoke-like! Talk about the right singers singing the WRONG SONGS and then the wrong singers singing the RIGHT SONGS - who had the GALL to give 'Never too much' to MARY J. BLIGE??? And 'Superstar' to USHER???? USHER????? Of all the incredible R&B singers in existence, including the completely acceptable version by Ruben Studdard, you will give a classic like 'Superstar' to USHER??? Unreal. This whole project just sounds like/ reeks music biz politics to me....my baby Fantasia, Im sorry, this is the worst thing I have ever heard her sing and I think Fantasia is incredible. And what da *!@#!! is that bunch of musical MESSES in between - Celine Dion (mediocre)/ Donna Summer (a remix nightmare) Wyclef Jean (unspeakable) Beyonce & Stevie (boring, and I LOVE those two) Aretha Franklin (a la Divas Live solo - all over the place)/ Babyface (boring) Patti LaBelle (predictable) - oh my goodness. Too much. BARELY saving the album by sheer musicality and good singing - John Legend - truly an original sound - Angie Stone and JAMIE FOXX (would you believe?). Still - not the right songs to really make them shine. What a headache...  And perhaps the most absymal act of wanton disregard - WHERE WAS LUTHER'S FRIEND, BACKGROUND SINGER, PERFORMER EXTRAORDINAIRE AND CONFIDANTE ON THIS PROJECT - LISA FISCHER????? Abysmal I say again.  Suggestion - next Luther Vandross tribute - and Im sure there will be in a year or two - keep some of Luther's friends...but please take some TIME to match the right song with the right singer....and some NEW, INTERESTING voices please...do some research - there are people out there who are amazing, unrecognised or yet unknown talents that would complement any tribute....LEDISI, RACHELLE FERRELL, RAUL MIDON, MELONIE DANIELS, WILL DOWNING, LEELA JAMES, LIZZ WRIGHT and a couple of undiscovered underground R&B/ Jazz gems right here in New York, Abby Dobson, Cole Williams, R'kardo, Gordon Chambers, Lynn Lockamie, Ryan Shaw, Sasha Allen and the list goes on and on....singers who work tirelessly at their craft and consistently give great work...  I am appalled. May Luther rest in peace, and not turn in his grave at this slapdash atrocity that does not give any valid credence to the magnificent body of work this artiste of standard has left to the world - as his legacy."
5,"But I never understood why they didn't catch on. They had a bona fide producer in Kay Gee (Naughty by Nature), incredible vocal chemistry, heavy-duty promotion, and catchy singles. This resulted in an impressive debut. So why the snub? I guess that will always be a mystery. Anywho, along with Blackstreet and Age Ain't Nuthin' But A Number, Pronounced Jah-Nay ranks as one of the top five BEST hip-hop/soul debuts of 1994. And here's why.  It was a very cohesive record, consisting of FIVE R&B entries, with ""Hey Mr. D.J."", ""Groove Thang"", and ""Sending My Love"" making the top five. You think that's the story? NOT!. The story is how good the REST of the album is. In fact, I will say (like other VERY strong debuts) that the album tracks are BETTER than the singles. And that's saying a lot, given there are only a handful of hip-hop/swing albums worthy of such praise in the 1990's. Those tracks are: ""Sweet Taste of Love"", ""Changes"", ""La La La"", ""For A Reason"" and ""Hey Mr. D.J. Remix"". That's eight cuts that should get played everytime it's in the CD player. It doesn't get much better than that.  In sum, Zhane turned out an impressive debut amongst an incredible year of hip-hop soul records. However, their fame didn't last long. They would go on to suffer the dreaded sophomore slump three years later and never release another set. But their debut will never be forgotten. It's hip-hop/soul at its peak when it was still relatively fresh. And that's what makes it irresistibly catchy. A hip-hop fan definitely needs to obtain this one, but a casual listener should as well.  Grade: A"
2,"It had been years since I'd heard this and thought I would add it to my collection, now I know why it has been years since I listened to it, I'll continue with my CCW, Bob Seger, Fleetwood Mac.."

5,"LOS LONELY BOYS, the self-titled album by three twenty something brothers from Texas, is jam packed with indescribably beautiful music that's one part rock & roll, one part country, one part Chicano, one part lullaby and 200 parts stone-cold gorgeous.  Because I'm a big hip hop fan who loves Pavoratti, I don't often find myself in this aisle of the music store. (And by the way what aisle is this?) But a friend gave me this CD and after letting it sit, collecting dust for over a year, I popped it into the stereo on a whim.  What a wonderful surprise.  Almost like love at first hear, I found myself bopping along to literally every tune, as though I had grown on this music.    These guys are amazing singers, musicians and song writers.  Bilingual, they often switch back and forth from English lyrics to Spanish ad libs. Plus it contains two versions of More Than Love, one in English and the other in Spanish -- which reminds the listener of their Texican roots.    Double sided, this CD features 12 songs on one side and 8 videos on the other.  Some are acoustic and reveal just how talented (not to mention charming) this band is.  Because I know so little about country, rock & rock and Mexican-twinged music, it is almost impossible for me to accurately liken this band's sound to anyone else's, but if forced to I'd say Sting.   Not because it sounds like Sting's music, but because it has that same soothing lullaby feel that comforts and convinces you've heard these songs all of your life.  Plus the writing is smart and the rhythms infectious.  -- Regina McMenami"
1,I loved this band. Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy 10 songs? Are you serious. I would never buy this.
1,"they just sound like coldplay all over again. do we really need another coldplay band? they seem talented enough to defy this genre, so i'm wondering why they haven't"
1,One of the worst albums of all time from one of the worst bands of all time. That's all I have to say..
5,"This album is one of the main reasons why I don't buy the argument that everything recorded by Sly Stone after ""Fresh"" isn't worth listening to. I bought this disc with low expectations, but after one listen I was convinced that this album was overlooked. To me, ""High On You"" is like a more upbeat ""There's A Riot Goin' On"". It almost seems like this album had the same production quality with the funk format of heavy bass, keyboards, backup vocalists, and driving beats. The main difference between the two albums is the lyrics: Sly seemed to be in a much better mood when this one was recorded. This disc seems a little looser and jazzier too. The instrumental ""Green Eyed Monster Girl"" is a good example, with a funky keyboard solo that sprawls over the entire four minute track. The liner notes indicate that Sly had a heavy hand in the recording of ""High On You"", stating that he played ""Everything - ?!!"". It makes sense then that this album was credited to him rather than Sly and the Family Stone. However, this album seems to have been dismissed, which is a shame. This may not have been his most memorable work, but this is a damn funky album and I can't find fault with that."
5,"I got this CD as soon as it came out. The song ""Caught Out There"" was catchy and didn't sound like anything I had been hearing on the radio. Kelis intrigued me with her unique vocals and  wild multi-colored hair. I listened to ""Kaleidoscope"" so much that I got sick of it and sold it. Big mistake! I want it back and I can't seem to find it anywhere. ""Kaleidoscope"" is definetly a good R&B album and my favorite songs are ""Caught Out There,"" ""Game Show,"" ""Suspended,"" ""Ghetto Children,"" ""Roller Rink,"" and the Spanish-esque ""I Want Your Love."" This CD also exposed me to The Neptunes and their signature sound, which is well known by now. Overall, this is very good music"
1,"The Kaiser Chiefs are supposed to be the next great thing from the UK. Give me a break! These guys are about as stimulating as a coma. Mundane has apparently become mainstream. I am probably older than your average reviewer, having purchased Jimi Hendrix albums when he was still alive, and gone to Replacement shows in Minneapolis when no one had heard of them but this group does nothing to deserve the praise found in these reviews. I thoroughly enjoy UK rock. I wore out copies of Quadrophenia in high school and love Bloc Party, Franz Ferdinand, and The Music as true progressions and successors to the ranks of Who fans who continue to relish British Pop and Rock. Maybe musicianship is not a criteria to go by but I produce more interesting music on my Mac than these guys can with a full studio of gear. I have never written a review before, but my disapointment in this CD has driven me to this rant! I love this UK revival of sorts and solute you all. Long LIve Rock! Kaiser Chiefs... learn to play those instruments You suck!  For those of you looking to find the excitement you found in the likes of The Jam or the Clash look elsewhere. Maybe the Rakes or Maximo Park will fill the need"
5,"when i looked at this cd on the cd rack, it was only 5 bucks so i bought just for the hell of it. so one day i put in that cd and i was blown away. songs like blackeye, can i borrow some ambition, bath of last resistance, true believers, coming down with me are all great. I LOVE THIS CD. ITS WORTH IT TO BUY IT"
1,"There are 2 good songs on this disc, Stinkfist and Aenema. The rest are pure crap. Half of the tracks aren't even songs, they're just a bunch of noise. No wonder Tool won't put any of thier music on itunes or napster. They want you to buy the whole cd so they can have your $14 for like four real songs and ten tracks of filler crap. If you gave this CD 5 stars there is something wrong with you and you should be beaten severely"
4,"This is a pretty good comp, but it could be a lot better. For one the sellouts(bosstones) shouldn't be on it. A lot of good bands from the warped tour were left out, and this was meant to capture the essence of the tour.  It didn't"
1,"I've listened to the samples of this Cd, and I was proved right. This Cd, along with this groups other Cds were emotionless, has no depth, originality, or meaning. The songs like ""Without You"" are just sickening to listen to. Not only do their voices sound sickening to the point where I want to wretch, but the songs on this Cd are just depressing to the point where you want to kill yourself. The originals were depressing, and so are the new versions of these songs. This is really getting old. Buy something from Joseph Vargo instead. Maybe there is something with originality in it. I'm sorry, but the truth hurts, and we need to face it. Don't buy this Cd, or all of Il Divo's Cds unless you want someone to laugh at you"
5,"The Orb's ""Adventures Beyond The Ultraworld"" was essentially one of if not THE first ambient house album (it at least inspired other artists and (somewhat) popularized the genre - ""Little Fluffy Clouds"" is a very appealing track). It is, admittedly, a little uneven. If you've only heard the song ""Little Fluffy Clouds"", be prepared for a quick change of pace. The rest of the album is very ambient and very experimental, but for ambient fans and the open-minded it's very interesting stuff to listen to. My personal favorites are the first three tracks, and the rest I don't think are as fun to listen to as a whole (they're definitely very good, though). It's not ambient in a traditional sense - there's definitely a beat in most of the songs which help keep them accessible. What's also great is how you're essentially getting two albums for the price of one (actually more like the price of 1.5 albums)! If it weren't for this fact and its influence on the world of music, I probably would've given it a 4.5. Ambient and electronica fans will definitely love it, though. Even if most people won't like the album as a whole, they'll most likely enjoy ""Little Fluffy Clouds"". Highly recommended!  Highlights include: the entire album"
2,"This album was recommended to me by several different sources, including Amazon and my local record store, which had ""mandatory indie classic"" in a sticker on the disc.  I tried it out a couple of times and Mangum's voice just takes away from everything else for me.  I just could not get into this ""experience"" and traded the disc back in.  I agree with the reviewer who says this is not for everybody.  If you can get over the vocals, by all means enjoy this album.  As for me, the vocals were just too much, or maybe not enough"
1,"Okay, so now you're on two hit songs.  Well done, I-20.  But that doesn't mean you should be a hit yourself.  To all the people that went out and bought this, I'm sorry but I really can't see why.  You can be a talented rapper.  Get an interesting voice with lots of expression, put in some good backings and you've got no problems.  But I-20 fails here on both counts.  Does anyone else think that he's got the most annoying voice?  That low drone is just a complete turn off and he doesn't even bother to vary his voice.  Maybe a good beat could have saved him, but there's no salvation here, either.  In fact, the key tracks are the ones where he collaborates with someone else and lets them have the centre of attention, only because we don't have to hear his voice - this makes Backstage & Hey Shawty bearable.  But, really, I-20 should take a good look at himself before he decides to make another album.  Feature on other people's songs, sure, then you can still be a star.  But at least then we won't have to listen to fifty mintues of you"
1,who needs dark side of the moon? wish you were here? the wall? animals?!?!?   just stick with post 83 floy
1,this hippy master of CHEESE made my middle years a living HELL with his horrid M.O.R. sap toons! How can ANYONE actually praise these corntastic AM gold leftovers from an era that had some REAL music  going on? This is like putting AIR SUPPLY over the BEATLES as a GREAT ROCK BAND---wake up America!
4,"When I started listening to Pompougnac I fell in love with the music. Some of my friends told me to start with number 5, I bough 3,4,5,6,and 7 the same day... thank god because number 5 was the one I liked the least... don't get me wrong it is a BEAUTIFUL CD and the songs are great but not the best of them... 6 and 3 are the best for me so I recomend to start with number 6 then 7 and then any of them....I have the whole Hotel Costes collection and it is just amazing. Stephane is a GENIUS..."
1,"Ok, this was the last Jacksons lp and I don't understand why this was their best selling, compared to the gem Destiny and super giant Truimph.  My father bought this in 1984 and did not even get his moneys worth.  This isn't a reunion album at all.  More like a high tech compilation disaster and Jermaine is only included in 1 track and Michael, only in 3.  Although no video availbale, I love the Mick Jagger colab ""State of Shock"" (#3 on billboard and #4 on Hot R&B/Hip Hop Singles) which was a celebrated pop/rock celebration and leading single off of lp.  ""Torture"" was torture and so was the video. Although top 20 hit, it was so horrible that Jermaine and Michael did not join their brothers in the video (although they provided lead vocals) and the later was replaced by a wax dummy.  ""Body"" was good although Marlon can not sing and the instrumental is a remisent to Micahel's ""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'.  Later for the rest of the tracks of the album and being the worst is Randy Jackson's falsetto disaster ""The Hurt.""  This lp (although I do not own the cd version of it) was a huge disaster as well as their ill-fated final tour promoting it."
2,"Twenty years ago, Michael Jackson was recognizably human, and although he was already considered to be slightly eccentric, he was the most beloved pop star on the planet.  And this album, even though it seemed harmless enough at the time, marks the point where things started to fall apart for him.  The infamous Pepsi Lite commercial shoot where he was seriously burned was part of an ad campaign coordinated with this album's release.    It was the last album made by the Jacksons/ Jackson 5, and the only one (so far) with all six brothers on it.  The album was rather hastily put together to fill a contractual obligation.  Michael contributes a couple of songs: the truly horrifying ballad ""Be Not Always"" and the danceable ""State of Shock.""    ""State of Shock"" was a collaboration with Mick Jagger, and it is now best remembered as the finale of the Live Aid concerts in the summer of 1985.  Mick did it as a duet with Tina Turner (and their wardrobe reveals went much better than Justin Timberlake's and Janet Jackson's did at the 2004 Super Bowl.)  And I think I have digressed, but that's OK because the other songs on the album are all done by the (then) less famous and (now) less notorious Jackson brothers.  These are assorted mid-1980s R&B pop numbers, nothing memorably good, nothing memorably bad.  The most enjoyable song, ""Body"" features the most obscure Jackson brother, Marlon, and also features an enjoyably moronic chorus which goes, ""Girl I love your body, so won't you come home with me!"" or words to that effect.  "
2,"Guys...it's not that GOOD. I have the album on my computer, and I gave it a few listens, but...it has no substance. It's not interesting or anything new. It's catchy. And irritating, after more than a song or two. That's all (""Bandages"" is enjoyable once in a while, I will concede).   If you're looking for catchy and poppy (and there's nothing wrong with that), then buy it. If you want something new and original - don't. And if you want good indie dance/electronica-type music go for something like The Faint, The Bravery, or Le Tigre."
2,"This sophomore collection holds no comparison to the more influential Nuggets collections-- Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965-1968; or Nuggets II: Original Artyfacts from the British Empire and Beyond. Those two box sets highlighted some unknown and early punk and pop rock influences and proved as influential as Harry Smith's folk collection. Not so here. I counted about an 1/8th of the songs decent, but have to ask how often will you return to these novelties? Not much"
5,"Please don't be fooled into thinking that Mr. Bucchino writes only ""theater"" music.  His songs are true art songs that can grace a recital stage.  I have included ""Unexpressed"" in my recital repertoire.  Not only is his music well written, but it is far from easy to perform and does indeed require the same attention to detail as any good art song.  This album was a real surprise and a joy to hear some of my favorites performed by other artists - another perspective from which to draw.  Just two words:  BUY IT"
1,"If you like your music reproduced with a synthesizer and 80's production quality, than this cd is for you. Other than that, you have to ask yourself why it was $10 at Walmart as stated by a previous review. (hint: not because it was a hidden gem)I couldn't give this less than a star because of the song selection. That is all this cd has going for it. So read the songs, enjoy it for what it is worth, move along and buy another comp that closely resembles this. (All in that order) Sorry drew, now go back to the drawing board"
4,"Pete Townshend didn't just invent the rock opera, but also the ""mini opera"" when he wrote ""A Quick One While He's Away"", which Pete often referred to in early performances as ""Tommy's Parents"".  Well, Wire and Glass could be ""Tommy's Grandparents"" because this rich song cycle delves deeply into Townshend's familiar semi-autobiographical world which will be instantly recognizable to any Who fan.  From the self-confessional ""They Made My Dreams Come True"" which echoes the Cincinnati tragedy (""people died when I performed"") and the Isle of Wight (""and the band played on until the dawn"") to the powerful Mirror Door which revisits Tommy and the Mirror in so many ways, Wire and Glass proves that while Daltrey's voice may be fading, Pete Townshend is still the best songwriter of his or any other generation.  To be fair, like any Who material, Wire and Glass works best on the stage, so be sure it see it live if and when you have the chance."
5,"Not only was this De La Soul's debut, it's also a landmark, classic album....De La carved out their own unique path in music and created a gem of an album on 3 Feet High and Rising....They presented an almost alternative form of hip hop...One where it was cool to let loose and poke fun at yourself instead of bragging how dope you are....As a result, they were unfairly labled ""hippie's""....  The music on here is top notch...Prince Paul, the groups main producer for their first 3 albums, delivers the goods at a time when sampling laws were much, much more relaxed....They do an amazing job of sampling Steely Dan on ""Eye Know""....Some of my other favorites include 'Potholes in my lawn, Me,myself and I, and the funky collab w/ the Native Tongue Crew (A Tribe Called Quest (actually just Q-Tip) , and the Jungle Brothers) ""Buddy""....  I highly recommend this album for anyone..."
2,"I was super excited when I bought Joann Rosario's first CD ""More, More, More."" Every song on there was gorgeous and inspired worship. I was just as thrilled when I found out she had a new release, ""Now More Than Ever...Worship."" I heard one of her singles, ""God"" and figured I HAD to buy the cd when it came out. But boy was I disappointed when I popped it in my cd player!!! The only stand out tracks are:  Track 3: Thanks Be Unto God Track 6: I Hear You Say Track 13: God The Bonus Track: Cuando Reposo En Ti   All of the other tracks are barely mediocre. It was as if she rushed the making of her cd just to keep her name out in the spotlight. I am extremely upset that I wasted $20 on this piece of junk. I thought some worship music would be on here, since the title of the cd is ""Worship,"" but don't be mislead by this fanciful cover and her pretty face. She should've waited until she had something solid to record instead of making this crappy attempt at music. Joann has indeed hit the dreaded sophomoric slump. I highly doubt that I'd buy anything else she sings. What was Fred Hammond thinking by showcasing her if he knew she was average talent? It's best to burn these songs from someone who already has the cd. The entire cd lacks the anointing. Even the bonus video clip on the installed media player, that features Joann and Donnie McClurkin sucks. All she does is add libs in Spanish, plays some maracas, some castanets and God knows what else and I'm supposed to bust a move to this?! NO WAY!!!   Two thumbs WAY, WAY DOWN!!!  A feeble effort by Joann. This will definitely leave a sour taste in your mouth, as it did mine."
5,"Wire was a blassed anomaly in the punk world, denying all attempts to categorize them as anything but brilliant.  &quot;Artpunk&quot;? nah...  &quot;Progpunk&quot;? nope...  See, nothing works.  Amazing &amp; very influential stuff.  REM &amp; the Minutemen both have publicly praised the genre-bending work of Wire"
2,"The Corrs are good at what they do..Trad-orientated pop, but on this album, I feel that they have lost their way a little. Always difficult to follow a 'Talk On Corners', but this album is just average,at best. There are some nice tracks here like 'All the Love in the World', 'Radio' and 'Breathless' but apart from these, nothing else really rises to the challenge. Lyrical content is amatuerish with this collection and it sounds like an album that was not as lovingly nourished as the others"
2,"Ok, first off, this is the first Corrs release i've listenend to. I'm offering my opinion without knowing anything else they may have done. I've listened to the cd 10 times or so, on random occasions when i need a break from my normal diet of punk and garage rock.  It sounds good. A little TOO good. I agree that it's overproduced, doesn't sound even remotely spontaneous. The studio work is well done, but OVERdone. I'd like to hear something else to see what they REALLY sound like.  The content of the songs is what bothers me. Aside from being sappy, sentimental drivvel (this is pop music, after all - i wasn't expecting anything else), everything sounds like a commercial ditty or a part of a movie soundtrack. Mmm-hmm.  Track 1 - I see a not-so overweight soccermom smiling on a treadmill at Curves(TM), then hopping in the Ford Expedition(TM), and cheering on the kids at their soccer game with a SunnyD(TM) in each hand.  Track 2 - Helicopter pans out as mid-20's girl drives curvy mountain road in VW Cabrio(TM)(R) with top down, thinking about handsome lover... ""LMN""(R) watermark in lower-right corner of screen...  Track 3 - Sad animals. Images of puppys in cages.  Track 4 - Actually, I like this one. Mellow, laid back.  Track 5 - Ugh.  Track 6 - This one is the MOST clever! I see the band members - 3 girls, 1 guy - on one side of a table under a hanging lamp in an otherwise black room, while 3 gentlemen in suits open a breifcase full of money, push it towards them and say, ""As you're aware, the radio has lost it's credibility. The kids are figuring out that there are other bands out there, beside what we pump across the airwaves at them. We need to entice them back. If you want a single, and this pile of cash says you do, then you'll do what you can to save this dying medium. Hell, you work in the word ""radio"" and we'll double what we're giving you."" Come on, the song even SOUNDS like a PSA for the International Radio Marketing Council...  Track 7 - Sounds like a Pepsi commercial.  Track 8 - Ugh. Wait, wasn't this Track 5?  Track 9 - Sappy, but ok. Sounds like they actually put effort into the lyrics. Thumbs up.  Track 10 - Not remotely original, but alright.  Track 11 - Interesting sound. Good beat. Correct me if i'm worng, but was that a semi-Pagan reference there? That would be a bold move, for which i'd applaud them, if in fact it is. Not that i'm Pagan or anything, but hey, its a religiously positive, non-Christian reference that doesn't involve Marilyn Manson, and that takes guts. Especially for radio-loving girls bands.  Track 12 - Laid back. Almost has a jazzy, lounge feel.  Track 13 - Produced by former Ace of Base member? Bubbly, upbeat, not too bad.  Track 14 - Written and produced by Avril Lavigne...  Track 15 - WOW! A RELATIVELY CELTIC-SOUNDING SONG FROM A RELATIVELY CELTIC BAND!! And instrumental, too - big thumbs up! In fact, maybe that's the key.  Whatever. Long-winded, i know, but fair. This album didn't turn me off to the Corrs completely, but i don't have very high hopes now.  Flame away, kiddies."
4,"Am I justified in believing that muscular, meritorious pop music -- the kind we shove our hands toward the volume knob for, the kind that thrills us just to be alive for -- is on the cusp of a major comeback, or do the continuous coronations of [...] we've witnessed so far this year mean that we're all sitting shivah for the good stuff and are too stoned on stupidity to recognize it?  The very same signs that appear encouraging from one angle are horrifying from another.  Look no farther than the terrific Anna Nalick, one of a sad handful of artists hobbled this spring by befuddling single choices (let's just say for now that whoever botched the radio plan for that sterling new Dixie Chicks record deserves a daily caning in the town square until no fewer than one of those babbling loudmouth heifers *is* ready to make nice).  Her gorgeous debut album, Wreck of the Day, got off to an okay start last year riding the coattails of first single ""Breathe (2 a.m.),"" so of course those dolts at Columbia Records went with ""In the Rough"" as a follow-up (why not that magnificent title track?  Or ""Forever Love""?  Or even ""Citadel,"" for cryin' out freakin' loud?!), and of course it tanked.  But then, just like manna straight from the fingertips of God Himself, the geniuses (geniui?) behind TV's gangbusters smash ""Grey's Anatomy"" used ""Breathe"" to underscore the heart-pounding climax of their season's most-watched episode, and Nalick was suddenly back in bid-ness.  Top forty was interested again, and Columbia -- ever eager-to-please -- came up with the bright idea of re-releasing Nalick's album with extra tracks, one of them being -- get this, guys -- a newly-recorded version of ""Wreck of the Day"" that is so balls-out horrendous, you just *know* they're going to make it the third single.  The sorry [...] -- every one of them -- need to be slapped.  Hard"
1,"Everytime i try to listen to jah i just think dam it's time to throw that cd out window and put on dmx, his voice and lyrics sound more like dmx's than pac's plus dmx wips his ass at hiphop. It's like jah is D's kid and when he gets outa line he has to be taught a lyrical lesson by his supiorer"
4,"I haven't had any problems loading or playing this disc on my computer (PC w/ Windows XP Pro). It ripped into iTunes just fine and then transferred to my iPod, where it also plays flawlessly. I have a ton of problems with DRM software on the Warner Brothers CDs (like the new Flaming Lips album, grrr, which Amazon does NOT warn you about), but this disc works just fine for me. Perhaps Norton, Ad-Aware, or Hijack This! are preventing programs from being installed on my computer without permission?  As far as the disc goes: This is the first BRMC disc I've picked up and after five listens, I really like it. It's a laid-back, mostly acoustic disc which in some places reminds me of the Jayhawks or the Eskimos, and in other places reminds me of the O Brother! Where Art Thou? soundtrack. There's even one track (Restless Sinner) that sounds a bit like the Grateful Dead.  There were a lot of songs with religous overtones (pretty much the entire back half of the album, actually), which was surprising at first but not jarring enough to distract the listener too much.   On the whole, this is a nice, peaceful album, relaxxing without being depressing"
2,"Well, I was also disappointed that certain songs were missing on the soundtrack. I do not however think it's fair to say this is a CD only for Blacks because it's all rap! That's ridiculous. But, I'll overlook that naive comment & say, even for those of you who do like hip hop, there were some good hip hop songs there that were missing. I loved that song they played while they were out on the basketball courts playing one-on-one (Let 'em Fight?). That's the song I wanted the soundtrack for & I was so disappointed. As for those of you interested in that Lynyrd Skynyrd song playing during the car chase, it's called, ""Saturday Night Special."" The soundtrack wasn't bad, just a disappointment. To see all of the songs that were played in the movie, visit: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0398165/soundtrack"
1,"This is a minstrel show. Period point blank. These guys set black people back 20 years. Look at them in ""black face"" on the cover of their album. They look like al jolsen twins. Then the music they make is insulting to every race color and creed. Any music that makes you feel dumber when you listen to it should be banned. I'm calling my alderman now to start the movement. LOL"
2,"I'm not into R&B so i'll skip the tracks i'm not interested in. Bought it only for Junior Vasquez Dub which is i must say really bad. Totally boring. I think Junior should release his latest work (Simone Denny - Cliche, Deepa Soul - As I Am)  on CD's instead of letting us buy only his worse mixes. Very unsatisfied"
1,"...and forgotten. Raw and ragged. Cliche-ridden. I consider albums like ""Highway 61 Revisited"", ""Bringing It All Back Home"", ""Blonde on Blonde"", ""Blood on the Tracks"" and hell, even ""The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan"" as worthy of five stars. Sorry, but this is just not in the same class or anywhere near those masterpieces. Those albums are deemed 'classics' for a reason. That said, I'm not at all a fan of the Band or many of Dylan's love songs so please take these things into consideration when contemplating the worth of both this review and this album"
5,I heard Dominic perform two songs from his album on Mike &amp; The Mad Dog and ordered it that day.  I knew he was a good singer having seen him perform on the Sopranos but I was really knocked out by this album. I love his version of O Sole Mio and the song from The Godfather (Parla Piu Piano) but what I really love is the song he wrote Song A Napoletano.  It is the very essence of this CD.  The best part is you'll be serenaded by his voice regardless of whether you understand or speak Italian. A great find
5,"I don't really like the Allman Brothers. I don't like jam music. I don't even like 70s rock. But I love this album. Listening to it in the deadness of an upstate NY winter, it still makes me feel like it's a summer day at the lake with a bunch of friends"
5,"Kate always reminds us of what the best southern music is really about.  In this fusion of southern atmospherics and blues, she touches the heart as few can in shades of country, gospel, folk and pop.    UP IN WEST VIRGINIA IN THE COLD COAL MINES THEY GOT BLUES MILES AND MILES OF BLUES FROM BUFFALO TO BALTIMORE TALK ABOUT HARD TIMES THEY GOT BLUES MILES AND MILES OF BLUES  This may be the best record in her distinguished discography.  Kate's voice, sweet and thick as molasses, is as wonderful as ever and remains center stage with a cast of amazing musicians (including: Walt Aldridge-producer and guitars; Jim Hoke-accordion and harmonica, Larry Franklin-fiddle, Randy Kohrs-dobro, Neil Rosengarden-trumpet, Bill Huber-trombone, Ron de la Vega-cello) and a who's who of harmony singers (Maura O'Connell, Guy Clark, Verlon Thompson, Mac McAnally, and Cindy Walker). Although the blues permeate nearly every song (often in very original ways), Kate finds hope as well.  THE GOOD NEWS IS THERE'S MUSIC TO EASE YOUR WORRIED MIND WHEN YOU GOT BLUES MILES AND MILES OF BLUES AND THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A GUITAR CRYING IN THE NIGHT WHEN YOU GOT BLUES MILES AND MILES OF BLUES  PEACE COMES STEALING SLOW FALLS LIKE SILENT SNOW SWINGS DOWN SWEET AND LOW PEACE COMES STEALING SLO"
5,"Like each colored brush-stroke makes a Van Gogh, this song is a masterpiece in 11 songs"
2,"As much as I loved the movie, I was very disappointed in the CD. I thought this was suppose to be a soundtrack. It is not! The French songs in the movie were lovely, this version is not what I expected"
1,"Wow! This is without a doubt,  THE WORST ORIGINAL CAST RECORDING I HAVE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE!!! Every song is pathetic, thank God there are only 14 of them because if there were any more i would have destroyed this crap! Not even ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" was this bad (And that was really bad). While I was listening I kept waiting for it to get better, to have some whitty lyrics or a good melody or somthing, ANYTHING, but nothing changed it just kept getting worse.  This crap includes the songs: This Side of The Tracks --1/10 One Step Closer --4/10 The Buck Stops Here --5/10 It Doesn't Take a Genius --5/10 Owner of my Heart --5/10 The Great American Tv Show --2/10 Flushed Down The Pipes --5/10 Storm's A-Brewin'--5/10 Road Kill --5/10 But He's Mine/It's Never Easy --3/10 That's Why I Love My Man --4/10 Panic --5/10 Finale --1/10 This Side of the Tracks (Reprise) --1/10  When I bought this album I thought it was going to be another Bat Boy, but boy was I wrong! Don't buy this disaster of an album you will be sorry if you do!   P.S The little lines before the numbers are minuses"
5,"The main reason in this review is to express my amazement and disbelief in several individuals reviews discrediting C. Wilson for his cover of ""Let's Chill"".  This whole album is banging, and for you young cats, here's a little history:   ""Let's Chill"" was released by GUY in `90/'91, (of course everybody knows Teddy Riley's name - if not, come on now, you need to educate yourself on one of the top 5 producers of all time...). Who in GUY sang ""Lets Chill""? Aaron Hall. Who was Aaron Hall's inspiration? Matter of fact - who was Aaron Halls ENTIRE vocal style based on? Who did Aaron Hall himself admit to admiring growing up and mimicking his style? CHARLIE WILSON. It's even been quoted that ""...even his vocal distinction is strangely similar to that of Charlie Wilson, a member of the R&B/Funk group The Gap Band"".  If you are a rookie, please listen to the old GAP BAND albums, and you will see who Aaron Hall sounds exactly like - lead singer Charlie Wilson. I actually give more props to Charlie Wilson for STILL being able to continue to release albums and make hits, while Aaron Hall seems to still be in that black hole of nowhere for quite a few years.  Moving forward, with the new ""Lets Chill"" remake, Charlie is really just putting it down just like GUY did, except with the same style that Aaron Hall bit off of him.  Man, maybe it's just me, but I think a lot of people putting reviews on here really don't really know their music.."
1,"76:14, Remotion, Pentamouous Metamorphosis...THOSE are Global Communication albums. This is pure drivel comprised mostly of (C)rap and trendy house music that has been remixed. My biggest complaint is that I didnt buy this CD to fill my house with the shameful vulgarities that normally accompany (c)rap music (and I use the term ""music"" here very generously) and that appear here in a few of the ""songs"". I bought this CD because the title of the group on this album is GLOBAL COMMUNICATION, not Gun Master Nig*er Bit*h F*!ker!!!   There is NOTHING here that resembles the music that Global Communication has released under the name GLOBAL COMMUNICATION in the past! Knowing that Mark Pritchard and Tom Middleton release music under other names makes me wonder why they didnt do so in this case? I dont expect the same old stuff from them (I was hoping that they actually had something new and interesting to COMMUNICATE) but packaging this GARBAGE into a CD released under the name GLOBAL COMMUNICATION is like packaging porn into a movie entitled  DISNEY'S BAMBI RETURNS....It just isnt right and quite frankly, is SUPER OFFENSIVE.   TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY for anyone expecting to hear Global Communication do something worthy of recording. Through ALL their releases (even the ones under other names) this is the most shameful, vulgar and deviod of anything remotely worthy of musical attention, thought or reflection"
1,"I could give a long winded review on how bad this album is, but let me just say this... Radiohead is one of the few bands that I fell for all the hype about.  What an idiot I was, I bought this cd and listened to it about 20 times trying to figure out what it was that I was missing.  I finally came to the conclusion that the masses are indeed stupid if this is supposed to be the new alternative or cutting edge or whatever.  The song creep is probably one of the worst rock songs of all time and the rest of the album is totally unmemorable.  Garbage folks that is all this amounts to.  The most overated band of all time perhaps? Oh by the way before everybody gets mad and assumes I didn't give any of their other so-called experimental releases a chance, let me say... it ahas all been done before.  You just have to dig a little deeper than MTV and Rolling Stone magazine to find it.  Don't believe the hype!"
1,"Faith Hill has been known (both celebrated and criticized) for testing the waters.  She has never ""played it safe""...until now.  First of all, this disc seems like a poor defense and/or apology for ""Cry"".  ""Cry"" was a great album.  It may not have been commercially successful, but it was a very personal album.  Amy Grant also had this issue.  ""Lead Me On"", though not her most commercially successful, was her most intimate and personal album.  Kudos for baring your soul.  This is the function of an artist.  As for ""Fireflies"", most of the music and song selection seems geared at making sure Faith Hill gets played on country radio.  Still wounded from being eaten alive by critics who disliked ""Cry"", Faith has decided to duck back into the 'safety zone' and win back her conservative country audience.    The only problem I have with that is that Faith Hill shines best when she pushes the envelope; when she goes out on a limb and tries something distinctive that stands out.  Nothing on this CD stand out.  If the songwriting is at all great, (as with the title track, Stealing Kisses, and If You Ask) the vocals fall short of emotional depth.    I understand that Faith is a lot older now, and she has to compete with vocal powerhouses like Carrie Underwood, and songwriting geniuses like Miranda Lambert, but it seems gone are the days of ""This Kiss"" and ""Breathe"".  However... Faith Hill is facing a double dose of dilemnas: ""Fireflies"" is not selling as well as ""Breathe"" and ""Faith"" did, and more importantly, her country audience still isn't quite impressed with the ""I-dyed-my-hair-and-hillbilly'd-up-for-you"" image that Faith has unveiled"
5,"Loreena's voice on this and every album is amazing - so perfectly suited to Celtic music. The first song I ever heard her sing was ""The Lady of Shalott"" (played on public radio in NC).  I had to stop the car and close my eyes!  Buy this album and every other album of hers - I'd be VERY surprised if you were the slightest bit disappointed"
1,I am at a loss to hear what people appreciate about this CD.  We were barely able to make it through one listening.  This is a classic example of a CD that NEVER would have been produced had the artist (using the term very loosely) not already been famous for something besides music.  The lack of talent and originality on this CD is apalling.  It only gets a star because that's the lowest rating.  I want my money back
2,"Strengths:handful of decent tracks, talent is present, cd has clean sounding guitars, vocals and bass drums, every now and then it almost gets exciting...for a few seconds  Weaknesses: they don't seem to know how to change their sound at all, almost no creativity, music is boring and not energetic at all, most tracks are long and exhausting to listen to, could have been much better than what it is    I'm surprised who P.U. is categorized with. Noone else thinks they sound a tad bit akin to TOOL?  I could be wrong...all I've heard from TOOL in forever is their radio stuff, but this sounds alot more TOOL-ish to me than, oh say, Taproot-ish or Endo-ish.  Hard 'n Heavy bass chords, clearly distinctive guitar rhythms and pounding bass drums, that sound just like TOOL. Vocals have that high pitch sound thats too one keyed and too soft for me. All songs seem to run at virtually one pace..SLOW. The music gets boring.   I can't hear where they've broken any real ground or added anything cool, catchy, or different.  I'm just not digging this disc as much as I think I should be.     With a cheap boombox you're likely to miss alot of the low end that makes the music strong and enticing.  So without good speakers, the music sounds even more wimpy and even more boring than with a good surround system. "
4,"In terms of nu-metal, this is definitely one of the best albums in this genre in a long time - if not ever. This is far from generic, as some of the other reviewers has blatantly stated, although some of the songs do sound run-of-the-mill and dry in places. Overall, though, this album is full of creative melodies and structures that you just don't find now-a-days in the 'nu-metal' scene. Don't settle for the garbage that's out there, this is a talented band with a unique sound [those guitars!] and a great album.  If you're into nu-metal but are starved for creativity and originality, pick this album up. It's not perfect, but it delivers."
1,"Wow, they actually put this ""anti-classic"" on CD.  Seriously, this is a very bad album.  Practically none of the ""superstars"" can sing, other than Jimmy Hart, and they are mostly stuck with dumb novelty songs.  Not that they fare too well when they sing ""serious"" songs.  Nikolai Volkoff has a decent baritone voice, but his thick accent renders ""Cara Mia"" unintelligible.  Probably the worst singing here is by Roddy Piper, although Captain Lou Albano gives him a run for the money.  If you are a fan of bad celebrity singing, you should get this album"
5,"This is an amazing collection of ALL NEW works from not only a master guitarist and stellar songwriter...but one of the smoothest and most amazing voices around (for another voice this good...see ""Neil Finn"").  Even if you've never heard of Vince Gill, or don't listen to country music - buy this cd and enjoy it (each cd is in a different style).  I just saw him last night at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles and he blew my mind.  He and his roughly 20 piece band were sensational.  He performed 5 or 6 tracks off each of the four cds in this collection and not one of them wasn't fantastic.  There aren't enough good things to say about this box set of all new material"
1,All of the songs except for ONE are TRASH on this one. Not worth forking over even $.01 for this one!!!
1,"this pile of crap, like all poser efforts, was created to make money.  after the 91/92 punk revolution via grunge, tons of bands jumped on the bandwagon to cash in. after realizing they had lost much of their fanbase during this period, gnr decided to try to gain some street cred by covering some old alternative songs and a golden oldie, but by doing so they proved just how little musical ability they had.  all the songs they covered were played in the exact format as the original with the exact same instrumental accompinament.  the old boys from la did nothing new and nothing creative.  but i do have to give them credit for one thing they did right, saying in the liner notes to pick up the original records, how true"
1,"Back in 1993 I was a kid that really loved Guns N' Roses. They were the best rock band in the world, so I decided to blindly buy this album, and to my surprise....it sucked big time. I don't like Guns N' Roses much now because I now understand their sometimes stupid and racists lyrics. However, this album compared to Appetite, lies and U.Y.I. 1 and 2 deserves a -5 stars. If this album would have been recorded by any other band it would sucked too and it would not have sold more than 2000 or 3000 copies.  My advice, if you like GNR you will find that all their previous albums are just wonderful, but please, don't buy this crap. The cover image says it all it looks like a s... and 99% of this album songs are s..."
5,"Intriguing historical account of MacNamara- what he was thinking, what he did not say during two administrations involved in the Viet Name war.  Use of film footage and Philip Glass' eerie and ominous soundtrack further developed the power of this film"
1,How come the songs sounded better in the movie. Some of the best songs from the movie were left out of this soundtrac
1,I dont see what people like about this CD. My 14 month old son and I looked at each other in disgust when I first played it!!! Very irritaing CD dont buy it!!! I am returning it today.
5,I remember that I had the Lifetime on cassette 20 years ago and never grew tired of it. I have always been a big Holdsworth fan and he really shines on this stuff. The second half of the cd I had not heard before and was disapointed that it had taken me so long to discover these tracks. Fantastic stuff  A must if you are a fan of either Tony Williams or Alan Holdswort
4,This is a nice CD and should provide hours of listening enjoyment.   I had been waiting for this CD to come out and I an not in the least bit disappointed
5,"Having gotten his magic songwriting touch back with Freedom, Neil finds the mystic of his avalanching guitar sound with Ragged Glory.  The album is awesome and fits perfectly alongside Neil's best work with the Horse"
1,"Wow, I never thought I would've found an R&B album worse than Omarion's debut until I finished listening to this album's samples on Amazon. ""Naked"", Marques Houston's spohomore effort, is undoubtedly the worst R&B album I have ever heard in a long while.  I apoligize for sounding harsh, but think about it. Where's the talent? Where's the skill? What about the heart & soul? Where's the musical ambition? What about meaningful lyrics & nice beats? Where's his dignity? Where's hist artistic growth? I'm betting he threw all that & so much more out the window along with his tacky clothes. Marques, take this into account...YOU'RE NOT USHER AND YOU NEVER WILL BE, SO STOP TRYING!  I honestly tried really hard to force myself to like his song ""All Because Of You"", but I just couldn't convince myself to do it. There's not a single song on this entire album that has any true emotional depth. His other singles, ""Naked"" & ""Sex Wit You"" are absolutely pathetic attempts at explicit sexuality, with egomaniacle, ridicuously retarded videos to boot. As if the cheesy, sexual come-ons & emotionally devoid ballads were hard enough to bare, you have miserable club tunes to complain about here & there.  Marques Houston is a perfect example of why R&B goes downhills nowadays. Anybody with a slight fraction of a brain would be aware that he has no talent, and relies on his ugly mug & flabby gut to seek the attention of ditsy tween girls worldwide. Skip this album at ALL COSTS (AND I MEAN THAT LITERALLY)"
1,"i loved marques houston in immature/imx.  his first solo cd was good.  he's a decent actor as well.  this cd, however, does not match up AT ALL with other stuff he's done.  all because of u and naked were good songs (and naked was a good video ;) )  i think there was one other good song - but, i sold this cd to a used cd store about 2 weeks after i got it.  i couldnt even listen to most of the songs all the way through.  boring.  vulgar language.  mh is just trying too hard by using the n-word a lot and talking dirty.  sex music can be classy - but not on his cd.  i was soooooooooooooooo disappointed with this piece of crap cd.  do NOT buy it!!!! "
5,I am a huge 80s fan and this is a terrific selection of some of the best songs from that time
5,"During the 80s, the Bangles solidified themselves not only as one of the best girl groups, but one of the best groups overall.  This CD contains an anthology of their greatest hits and will take you back in time to the 80s.  Led by Susanna Hoffs' melodic vocals, Michael Steele's bass, Vicki Peterson's guitar, and Debbi Peterson's drums, the Bangles created a collection of songs that have stood the test of time and still remain popular today.  This CD is loaded with great songs, including ""Going Down to Liverpool"", the classic ""Manic Monday"", ""If She Knew What She Wants"", the #1 ""Walk Like an Egyptian"", ""Hazy Shade of Winter"" from the movie ""Less Than Zero"", the upbeat ""In Your Room"", and another #1 ""Eternal Flame""  This greatest hits CD is the perfect collection for the person who doesn't want to go out and buy each individual album.  All of the best songs are contained in this great single CD.  I highly recommend this great disc.  Listen to this CD and hear one of the best girl groups from the 80s"
1,"How can you not relate to Ludacris's music? It deals with every day life like chilin in da hood and slapin da bitchis an hos. It's so deep. I can identify with his music so much it's scary. i sure hope one day I can become a musical genious like him. Forget about no-name bands like Pink Floyd, Yes, and Radiohead, they're never played on MTV so saying that they're talented is like saying Ashlee Simpson didn't create rock n' roll! Ludacris-the most talented musician on the planet-is going to change the world!!!                                                                                                           If you took any of that seriously, this album is for you"
1,Tipsy and Hood Hop were decent but the rest of this crap is flat out horrible. This was one of the worst rap albums of last year and hopefully this dumbass won't make another album or will step his game up. XXX wasn't bad but this dude still is a horrible rapper and I don't recommend buying this trash at all. If you want a good mix of party and gangsta songs get 50 Cent's Massacre album instead or even Ja Rule's R.U.L.E. Those aren't classics but they are much better than this garbage
5,"The title says it all.  Just throw all the tracks in a hat, and pick out a hit.  So much emotion was drawn to each track you can feel it.  For myself, this album represents tons of memories and great times.  I suggest it to any and everybody"
5,"Great performance by Rex, absolutely unreproducible! L&L's impeccable collaboration is one great pre-Soundheim work."
2,"This is not necessarily an indictment of Aimee Mann or holiday music....though I do find such disks as being cheesey. I was a bit surprised when I heard Mann was coming out w/a holiday album.  It seemed a bit above someone who has based a career on not only  original material, but non-mainstream music.    It has also always surprised me that at the plethora of holiday disks that are out there and how many more come out each year.  Is it just me - or are there only 18 holiday songs in existance to begin with?  There is only so many different ways to cover ""I'll Be Home for Christmas"", ""Winter Wonderland"" - all of which I believe are covered by James Taylor, Sarah McLachlan and Better Midler, all of which were released this month.  I'm guessing they are cheap to produce and easy to pull in profits.  That being said - I still like Mann's voice and she comes through with 3-4 songs that are above the fray.  ""Whatever Happened to Christmas"", ""Christmastime"" and her original ""Calling on Mary"".  I also liked the fact that she covered ""You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch"".  That seems to suit her more.  Not my cup of tea - but the songs I mentioned are the reason the disk gets 2 stars"
1,"this review is pretty funny you have to admit..... ""This band has the most retarded lyrics I've ever heard - ""Sometimes the sun goes down, sometimes it goes back up, I'm wondering which one you are watching now."" Huh?? Forget about the singer's gross melodramatic voice or the band's boring decision to steal riffs from the Strokes - just check out those lyrics!! The sun doesn't 'sometimes' go up and down, it ALWAYS goes up and down - ALWAYS - you morons. ""I'm wondering which one you are watching now."" Which one? Excuse me, last time I checked, we have only ONE sun, not two. Whatever. Maybe these hipsters should've spent more time in school and less time working on their hair. Their first record was trying to sound like Weezer and now they're trying to sound like Hot Hot Heat. How lame is that? And why are these guys trying so hard to look like the Strokes? They even have that token dude with the caucasion 'fro. I was suckered into seeing these guys at Spaceland last month and overheard the singer ""pep-talking"" his band. So embarassing. ""Okay, guys, have fun tonight but make it look natural. You never know who might be in the audience. And don't forget, those fat girls in the front row bought some merch so pretend to be nice to them and we'll make fun of them later."" Cool guys."" "
4,"This album has it all: *actual* country music, a couple of rockers and humour (Aviator).  The music that's on here puts mainstream country radio to shame.  See Shooter live if you get a chance.  You won't be disappointed"
5,"I keep seeing all over the reviews that this is intended for kids.  I am 40 and the owner of a studio.  I have been involved in music production since 1985 and I have got to say that the music this duo is putting out is phenomenal.  Not only is the music fantastic, but the production is flawless.  My daughter watches Disney channel which is where I was first exposed to Aly and AJ's music.  I was blown away when I first heard ""Rush"" and when ""Chemicals React"" came out, I was convinced that ""Rush"" wasn't a fluke and decided to buy the CD/DVD.    With the exception of the two cover tunes at the end of the CD, this disk is awesome.  Don't get me wrong, they have done a great job on the cover tunes, I just don't know why they put the covers on it; their stuff blows the covers away.  This CD is definitely not one with just a couple of good songs; they are all good. I'd recommend this CD for anyone who likes modern rock. "
4,"The cd includes versions of &quot;All or Nothing&quot; and &quot;Dov'and L'amore&quot;. The &quot;All or Nothing&quot; remixes are fantastic, specially 'Almighty Definite Mix'.  All &quot;Dov'e l'amore&quot; versions are great, with a special attention to 'Tony Moran's Anthem Mix' and 'Ray Roc's Latin Soul Vocal Mix', turning this new single one of her bests.  The beautiful cover follows the same style of the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; collection and the show in Las Vegas, available in VHS and DVD, a must have!"
4,"Jeff Lang gives a fresh and personal voice to the blues.  Another reviewer complains that he isn't Son House or Robert Johnson and so forth.  Yeah, this is what... 60 years later?  A blues fan for many years, I get tired of guys that can't look beyond their dusty old records and nostalgia for an era that they didn't live in and perhaps didn't quite exist.  Son House is fine, but he had limited musical talent.  Jeff is not only technically talented, he brings a fresh personal message into a style that has too long suffered from a lack of innovation"

1,"For my version of this album, O.G. means old guy. For my opinion, he is not a very good rapper. He should retire pernamently"
5,"This is simply one of the loveliest albums you will ever hope to hear.  Tracyanne Campbell and her band mates in Camera Obscura have labored under the shadow of their fellow Glasgow musicians Belle and Sebastian.  It doesn't help that like Belle and Sebastian their songs are more softly edged and lyrical than most other rock bands.  But although there is a superficial resemblance between the two bands, especially when Imogen Campbell takes the vocals instead of Murdoch, there are also significant differences.  Campbell is a far more delicate songwriter than Stuart Murdoch and her compositions are far more delicate.  She lacks his brilliant quirkiness and astonishing gift for melody, though her songs frequently feature very fine melodies.  But Murdoch is probably the finest melodist in music today, so the comparison is unfair to her.  On the other hand, most of Campbell's lyrics express emotions that I can relate to far more easily than Murdoch's.  He may be the greater artist, but she lives pretty much where I do.  Camera Obscura turned out two very good albums before this one, but this is easily their best effort yet.  All of the songs are consistently excellent and Campbell's lovely voice graces everyone.  She is a remarkably subtle singer, very gifted in her phrasing and expression.  But as fine as she is as a singer, she is better as a songwriter.  I like a lot of the cuts on this disc, in particular ""I Need All the Friends I Can Get"" and the truly sad ""Dory Previn,"" about the young Mia Farrow breaking up her and Andre Previn's marriage.  But my favorite cut by far is the extraordinary ""Lloyd, I'm Ready to Be Heartbroken,"" named for one of Lloyd Cole's best songs on his classic album RATTLESNAKES, ""Are You Ready to Be Heartbroken?""  All in all, this is one of my favorite albums of the year so far.  I think it will appeal strongly to anyone who loves Belle and Sebastian, but also to people who are drawn to Mazzy Star.  The album possesses much of the same wistfulness and longing found on their albums.  Basically, if you love wonderfully subtle and magnificently fragile music, this is going to win your heart"
1,"It was, and remains, one singular sensation. A Chorus Line changed the face of American musical theater, with an urbane book by Nick Dante and James Kirkwood and sophisticated yet obvious lyrics and music by Ed Kleban and Marvin Hamlisch. The Pulitzer prize-winning musical has been resurrected in Broadway and on CD . . . And we can't wonder why. Those familiar with the original cast recording will cringe at the flatness of the ""new"" recording, a recording that's simultaneously intrusive on the memory and superfluous in any collection. Is this what Baayork Lee did for love"
1,"when the man sings, he sounds like he is blowing through an off key microphone.  The songs and lyrics are all so terribly written and sung, If you can call that singing at all"
5,"This is a great collection of hits.  It's great to be able to buy these cds where you like every song on the cd and not just one -- that's why I but the collections of hits, but then you can't go wrong with Alan Jackson"
1,"let's just get this out of the way now. maysa? i'm on your team babes, but this cd just hasn't done it for me. i got your 1st cd & was hooked. i waited for the next & was floored! not in a good way! the cd jacket was so drab & tired, just like damn near every song inside the case. i let it sit on my shelf & decided to give it a listen again. still i didn't feel it. it's in my car right now & i still can't get through it all. i'm still on your team though. i have your latest & i play it 2 death. over & over. cd's 1 & 3 are both must haves. but this 1 stinks"
5,"I think this album is stunning and fantastic! i have recently been getting into Kates music...first i got Hounds of love and was immediatly sucked in i loved it and still do,what an album! Then i got The kick inside which i also immediatly liked but it lacked a little something not sure what that somehting is? i then got never for ever, wow so diffrent and hypnotic and growed on me so much every time i listened, and then this. Abit upset and put off but some other reviews i had set my mind to get this so thats what i did, definately NOT dissapointed! so what if its more in the times and a bit over produced and maybe lacking some of the crazness??? its such a good good album! still has amazing melodies, craaaaazy lyrics and its fun (even though some of the subject matter isnt, kate was struggling at the time) rubberband girl,moments of pleasure,song of solomen,lilly,top of the world and why should i love you are highlights for me but my fave song is the amazing and unbelieveably touching ""and so is love"" as soona s that song had finished for the first time for me i was like""WOW"".....seriously give ALL of Kate a chance, im getting ""the dreaming"" this weekend and I KNOW im in for an amzing challenge, but i also know i will love that too! The red shoes doesnt deserve bad reviews just because its not people BEST kate album"
2,"Ni se molesten en comprar esta basura, no sirve, nada que ver, El problema es el siguiente aunque ya sabemos que el quiere cantar pop en vez de salsa no es la primera vez que lo hace y a tenido mucho exito con los otros cds anteriores pero este desde que comienza la lirica de las canciones como que no riman, el ritmo tampoco ayuda, el disco anterior si que era un disco tenia salsa y pop como este. El anterior le da 20 patas a este,al parecer el cambio los arreglistas si me gusta como una o dos canciones es mucho ( boricua siempre sere y sobre tu piel) tanta espera para nada.........."
1,"Seriously you dont need me to tell you wack this album is, if you've ever heard it you'll know yourself the depths that this album plummets to.  I'll be honest, I heard Thug Lovin on the radio and thought it was O.K, all the other singles though, Mesmerize etc.. were s**t.  A friend of mine offered to burn me a copy, free of charge, and i thought fine, what's the worst that could happen, I was mistaken, I would compare listening to this with torture.  If your into sing along pop songs, with a little bad language for good measure, you may like this album.  To put this in the hip-hop genre is misleading, Ja actually attempts to 'sing' half the songs on here, and when he's not singing he does his best Tupac impression.  Thankfully at the time of writing this, his career appears to be over, if we can rid the hip-hop world of Nelly and 50 Cent as well, the world would be much better  for it.  Avoid any albums by this phoney.  Message to the honorable, agreed most of the rappers listed are s**t, but Ja destroying Snoop, Eazy-E, Mack 10 and DMX, don't talk s**t, this diva couldn't touch any of them.  After writing this I noticed someone was selling this album on Amazon for 1 cent, that should tell you all you need to know about it"
4,"first of all, I should state that I am the number one Steely Dan fan in the world and yeah I know, this is a Fagen work. when I first listened to this CD I was unimpressed.  same old same old.  But listen again (and again) and it will grow on you.  it will remind you of the days when you said to yourself ""this band is *$%#@ good - i'm glad so-and-so (kathy) turned me on to them"".  favorite track is ""mary shut the garden door"" - not because of the lyrics but because of the jazz.  "
1,Very dissapointing. Too many wildlife creature noises. If I had wanted to hear birds singing in the rain and other animal noises I would have looked for a title that matched my request. I wanted to hear rain and thunder only.
2,"This Cd I feel is too long. I can't stand Foreigner anymore, they used to be great. Awful edits like Urgent, Jukebox Hero, & Waiting for a Girl Like You have to be changed. And that boring ballad, what is it?????? I Want to Know What Love Is....Irritating for 2 minutes. And that singer, he kind of raises his voice too much. Not one of the best bands I have ever heard. Other irritating songs are HEADKNOCKER, Blue Morning, & Head games and they kinda suck. They just give me on my nerves. This is noise.....buy any album from Dire Straits insted. Dire Straits are the best....................................."
4,"'Magical Mystery Tour' is the most uneven of all the Beatles' albums.  The familiar songs are magnificent, but while some of the originals are poor, they are always interesting.  The American record company did a cut-and-paste on all of the Beatles' albums up to 'Sgt. Pepper', and, while it was to their great detriment, their intervention here was a masterstroke.  Because EP's (extended plays, records with five to seven songs, like a half-album) are part and parcel of the UK and not the U.S., this c.d. contains a jackpot of the Beatles' accomplished singles of '67.  Without them there wouldn't be a full album as we know it. Significantly, it was the only time the British record company later complied to the US format.  To start, the title track is a fun, carnival anthem.  It is looser and less serious than 'Sgt. Pepper'.  Then, Paul, subjectively matches himself with the perceptive and beautiful ""Fool on the Hill,"" with its admonitions from yet another memorable character, meant to look at the conventional world differently at the expense of alienation.  However, it is John's ""I am the Walrus"" that pours out surreal imagery (yet borrows a few references from Lewis Carroll) that is the album's highlight.  From there the original songs are interesting, but substandard.  ""Flying"" makes an interesting instrumental with vocals added without any discernible words, but it seems more like an exercise than a good song.  Much in this vein, ""Your Mother Should Know,"" is a shadow of Paul's best vaudevillian efforts, including ""When I'm Sixty Four"" and ""Honey Pie"".  The echoing vocal effects don't do anything to contribute to the song, either.  Also, George contributes what may be his poorest Beatles' song, ""Blue Jay Way"".  While it is understandable that spiritual awakening is the heart of all major religions, this song is done with unremarkable lyrics and sung with effects that make it sound like he's a deep sea diver accompanied by drowzy cello patterns.  The remarkable second half almost needs no elaboration.  ""Hello/Goodbye"" heralds the second half with one of their catchiest songs.  ""Penny Lane"" and ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" made what many believe to be one of the best singles ever.  The former is glorious and the latter is Lennon at his philosophical best.  ""All You Need Is Love"" may seem somewhat dated, but it needs a revival (and not just in credit card commercials!)  It is still a remarkable and entertaining anthem and subjectively one of the Beatles' very best songs.  ""Baby You're a Rich Man,"" the song's B-side is no throw-away, either.  Clever and funny, like Lennon, it is a catchy and mesmerizing piece.  Song for song, 'Magical Mystery Tour' is still essential.  It represents their most uneven effort, but retains some of their best music. Either way it always remains interesting.      "
5,"Game on, this is good stuff!  To be honest, I wanted to like Ray's first solo Stag a lot more than I did, which is why I walked, not ran to Prom,   But then that was before I caught the Indigo Girls last summer, where Ray and her mandolin wowed the crowd with the anthem Let It Ring.  It was the first time I'd heard it and it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.    The theme throughout is pretty obvious, it's called Prom, after all.  But it's also pretty obvious that you didn't have to grow up queer in small town rural America to feel like a freak. The sentiments of adolescent angst and isolation are universal, after all.  But beyond waxing poetic about adolescence, there are some great cuts offering stories of love's trainwrecks and dissatisfaction with the music industry, as well.  This album is less gritty than Stag and the sound is a lot more refreshing and graceful than you might expect.  This outing is to Ray as All That We Let In is to Indigo Girls.  The album showcases the elements we've come to expect from Ray and the Indigo Girls: unflinchingly honest lyrics coupled with uncompromising musicianship.  Those are rare commodities in today's music industry.  Unleash your inner awkward teenage/freak/geek self and enjoy the Prom."
1,"My sister got this CD, and at first I didn't care. Until I heard the Beatles covers. I was absolutely horrified at what they did to those classic songs. The people who make these are the spawn of idiocy.  If those kids ruin another great song I'll hunt them down and throttle them in their sleep"
2,"don't get me wrong, there's some great stuff here: Behind Blue Eyes, Substitute, Bargain, Won't gGet Fooled Again, Baba O'Reilly, a few others.  But if the Who are going to be in the co. of the all time greats, there shouldn't be any filler on a 2 disk set anthology.  They're the most overrated band in rock history. tried to be rockin' and rollin' rock and roll while at the same time putting a lot of effort into concept albums, didn't get the mix right.  Pink Floyd mastered the concept album 'per se', David Bowie gave us the concept album that really wasn't (rise & fall of zig strdst & spdrs frm mrs), while tommy, 4ophenia, and the one that was aborted (I forget the working title)fall short, somewhere in between. Just as the Who fall short, somewhere in between the Beatles, Stones and Led Zep. Daltrey as a great frontman? gimme a break; not worthy of shining the shoes of Jagger or Plant, not even Ozzy (in his prime with Sabbath) or Ian Gillan (Deep Purple). He doesn't even sing on some of their most famous songs, and he didn't write any of them (to go by the liner notes that came with this disc, anyway).  Many of their songs are described as quirky. 'silly' is closer to the mark. How 'bout just 'dumb'?  The Stones declared that 'time was on their side' and marched defiantly in the face of all obstacles, including time itself . The Who promised that they would die before they got old, on the other hand, and failed to deliver. This was my last attempt to 'get into' a band that I USED TO feel guilty for never having 'gotten into"
1,"I, like many others, wanted to like this CD, but was really disappointed. A lot of work obviously went into the creation of this. They have an interesting sound at first that quickly gets predictable.  I thought the first song was decent enough, but after that the CD spirals downward fast. The main problem, as many reviewers have noted, is the singers voice, which is often hard to hear. But if I had a voice like his, I'd probably want it towards the back of the sound mix.   The most original thing about this CD was the liner notes/lyrics, which are presented in the form of a funeral program. Get it? Cool, huh?"
5,"Death Cab For Cutie's follow up to their 1999 debut Something About Airplanes continues to build on their ethereal, atmospheric, unique, indie pop-rock sound.  We Have The Facts is a more experimental, dynamic, rock album that still retains the previous album's sentimentality.  This is the album that transformed them into experimental indie rockers, but didn't launch them into the mainstream.  This is a pure work of art, technically the band uses the chords in a very abstract and sparse way, the percussion is slow, and contemplating.  Some songs break out of that pattern and demonstrate a more full bodied, but not yet developed sound.  Most of the album relies on the musical  production.  Ben Gibbard's voice is as haunting and beautiful as it ever was.  He is given the perfect backdrop which complement his voice well.  These songs work so well because of their minimalism.  This album has a great sophistication to it, there is nothing else like it.  The structures of the songs aren't traditional, so they seem refreshingly new and never get tiresome.  Each song is sequenced so that it works well against the last song, and the songwriting captures the emotional depth of the music perfectly.  Lyrically, the songs focus on loss and relationships.  Company Calls Epilogue is about a wedding gone sour, while 405 is about relationship.  The wavy guitar melodies are catchy and loosen up the sometimes slow pace of the songs.  This is an album that gradually builds on you after a couple listens.  It's not over the top, and requires multiple listens to capture the depth of the music.  As a whole, the album works incredibly well, it's cohesive and consistent.  These songs have been crafted carefully and are painfully addictive once you begin to appreciate their sophistication.  This is indie rock at it's finest.  The production takes this album up to new great heights.  This album is similar to The Forbidden Love EP, which is also good.  In my opinion, We Have The Facts, and The Photo Album demonstrate Death Cab's early raw style, where everything was understated simply and beautifully, before the overproduced Transatlanticism and Plans.  This is a great album to listen to if you want to relax, or just think.  As they continue to develop as artists, it's amazing to watch their sound change, for better or for worse.  Recommended.    "
1,"Cassie is a beautiful young girl who used to model and been discovered by Mottola and been taken under Diddy wings.This cd has good beats and thats all i can say cuz thats all Im hearing .Her voice is very weak and low ,sounds as she s whispering and she absolutely cannot perform live.This is Not Quality Music.I would not reccomend this cd"
5,"This album is mostly lyrical songs, but not in a bad way. This is a good album for fans of the lyrical songs of the series. The styles on this OST range from blues-rock to cowboy western to metal to sugary-sweet pop to medieval music. The range between all the vocalists is very vast and very welcome.  ""American Money"": Is the bounty hunter t.v. show's theme, very western with it's banjo and gunshots. ""Don't Bother None"": An awesome blues-rock song sung by the gruff Mai Yamane. Here voice is rough and raw and perfectly fit for this kind of song. ""Live in Baghdad"": The random metal song in the mix, with surf guitar. I love this song exactly for it's randomness in the series. ""Cats on Mars"": A super-cute song! This is the absolute cutest song of the series. It's poppy, it's cute, it's fun. Hard to resist. ""Green Bird"": A sweet vocal by Gabriela Robin, her voice is so gentle and nice. ""Elm"": A song that sounds like a medieval ballad from a skilled guitarist. It's so beautiful and addictive, the vocals are perfectly harmonized and the skill of the guitarist is very impressive"
4,"The quintet, which forms My Morning Jacket, hail from Louisville Ky. The lead singer and band's leader/founder has the unlikely name Jim James. I have to assume that since Jim is the shortened version for James, making his formal name James James, that his mother was drunk when she named him. J.J. founded the band in the late nineties with his cousin, guitarist John John. Gotcha! Just kidding. Cuzz's name was John Quaid. Cuzz along with keyboardist Danny Cash, found the touring too much of a grind and left the band after the release of their third album. In addition to J.J. their current lineup consists of: Two-tone Tommy on Bass, Patrick Hallahan on Drums. Late joiners Bo Koster (keyboards) and Carl Broemel (guitar) replaced Quaid and Cash.  Z  My first impression of `Z' was that it was quite a bit different than my typical choice for aural enjoyment. My second impression was that it was not something for which I would lay down fifteen bucks. My last and continuing impression was that there was, indeed some worthwhile enjoyable music emanating from my CD player.  Trying to categorize the band's music is challenging. I word have to say the overall the band play's an indie sounding pop-rock with forays into progressive, folk and alternative, even psychedelia. Their music tends to be happy and poppy with a lot of variation between songs. The album starts off with a song named ""Wordless,"" which actually reminds me of the song ""Angel"" from the Romeo and Juliet soundtrack but with a mild cha cha style beat. It's probably because of J.J.'s strong singing on the song but for me the similarities are strong. ""It Beats 4 U"" White Stripes beginning doesn't impress me, but picks up in the middle with J.J.'s reverberated vocals, a cello, some whistling, finishing somewhat psychedelic. Track three, ""Gideon,"" has some interesting moments with J.J. sounding like he's singing through a tunnel yet his vocal remain strong. The song has some noticeably good keyboards and the tempo builds ending in a crescendo.  ""What a Wonderful Man,"" is a short mulligan stew style song featuring tavern kind of vocals and a tinny guitar."" Track five is ""Off the Record."" I didn't particularly like the beginning but about a third of the way through it becomes a fabulous bluesy, psychedelic instrumental. ""In the Woods"" starts out with a circus Hammond which recurs throughout augmenting an um pah pah circus beat. The seventh song is ""Anytime,"" probably the rockingest if not the catchiest song on the album.  The next song at just over six minutes is the penultimate longest song. Other than some really good piano parts, that seems to be the most memorable part of ""Lay Low."" The ninth track, ""Knot come loose,"" is a forgettable ballad but the last song ""Dondante is an eight minute masterpiece, by far the best and most refreshing song on the album."" Beginning inauspiciously with J.J. singing to a slow casual beat and subtle guitar, the song heats up after a slow start, immediately after a nice guitar solo into an explosion of sound, featuring J.J.'s soaring vocals and a whining guitar, ala post rock style, before gradually fading out to obscurity.  Conclusion  I don't think I'd plunk down fifteen bucks for ""Z"" because even though it's a pretty good album, I would seldom if ever be in the mood for this confluence of eclectically influenced music, especially since I tend to gravitate to the heavier variety of music. However, I cannot help but feel that it would appeal to a large segment of the music buying public. Are you one of them?  Final rating 4 stars."
2,"I saw this on a ""best of 2005"" list and I have to say I am disappointed. The musicality of this record is not too bad. It's not terribly creative, but it is enjoyable. What really turned me off was the incredibly vapid and thoughtless lyrics. Unfortunately this is just another pop record, of which there are way too many these days. The only track on here that I would give a second listen too is seagull. I wouldn't recommend the rest of the album"
2,"I traded my girlfriend my Nickelback CD for Joss Stone. Now I kinda wished I had kept my Nickelback CD. She hates the Nickelback CD and I hate the Joss Stone CD, but she also hates the Joss Stone CD. If I kinda liked the Nickelback CD better I would of kept it because I kinda knew I wasn't going to be into the Joss Stone CD. But I just kind of figured the Joss Stone CD would be a little bit better than the Nickelback CD and my girlfriend was completely thinking that the Nickelback CD was gonna be a LOT better than the Joss Stone CD, but man was she let down completely. And for as much as I really don't want the Nickelback CD back at this point I just assume let her keep it and I'll get by with the Joss Stone CD. I mean I guess what I am trying to say is that I sorta liked the Nickleback CD in the beginning, but once my girlfriend said she hated it I figured I got the better end of the bargain by trading her for the Joss Stone CD which at first seemed like a much better CD to have than Nickelback. I think my girlfriend wants to trade back again and if we do then I guess I just have to live with the Nickelback CD, but I'll prolly never play it again if she gives it back to me. BLEH!!  Matthew"
5,"Well, I am amazed that at 64 or 65 years old Ron Isley is still making incredible music.  However, some of the lyrics are explicit.  This CD would be great for a honeymoon.  The CD should have a sticker on it entitled, ""SERIOUSLY, FOR ADULTS WHO WANT TO CONCEIVE CHILDREN!""  But I guess that's why the CD is entitled, ""Baby Making Music."
2,"My wife bought this for me.  I was really looking forward to listening, but I found it a painful experience.  I not sure if it is the song choices, the production values, the arrangements or a combination, but the album overall is just a huge disappointment.  No songs from it have made it on to my Ipod"
1,"To be quite honest, I don't understand how anyone could consider this trash to be music. It is just a bunch of noise. I could do what these guys do with a bunch of 13-14 year old amatuer drum, guitar, and bass players in my garage. There is little to no rhythm to their music, and the vocals, quite frankly, are horrible. I can't even tell one song apart from another.  Grindcore just makes Metal look bad. The only Grindcore bands I actually do enjoy are Pig Destroyer and Agoraphobic Nosebleed. Go listen to some of their stuff if you want good Grindcore. Ed Gein is just talentless garbage. Don't bother with The Tony Danza Tap Dance Extravaganza either"
5,"I listen to this CD at least twice a week.  Definitely worth every penny and then some.  My faves are: I wanna be your lover, Do me, baby, delirious, I would die 4 U, If I was your girlfriend, Kiss, Sexy M.F., Gett Off, Cream, and of course, purple rain.  Highly recommended"
5,ok its true TTR dosent have the best singer but he can write good songs.If u find the lyrics they are very touching.These guys are now working on a full lenght and eating up the local/indie scene. The best tracks are Talk Radio and Plans To Wake Up On The Beach. Strong buy if you like punk/emo
5,"Energy=Hot Hot Heat! this album is full of it, though not just in the album as well as on the stage these four performers pour their hearts out to you and sweat as the play their instruments. With catchy melodies thougout the album, though fast that you have to look at the lyrics to see what exactly he says, you'll be sure to enjoy this alternative' dance album that makes any kid that thinks he/she is to cool to dance, Dance!!, that is all Hot Hot Heat makes you want to dance, besides that, they also have other songs like ""elevator"" and ""jingle jangle"" to tone down the album. This whole album comes from all of the emotions of a gone band member, but newly found one, being a great addition, and being in love. So to dance and sing get this album."
1,"i dont know why people like broken social scene, they are boring boring boring. i listned to this entire album and it was difficult. i wanted to turn it off really bad, but i had to go through it all to prove to myself that it is not good for anyone. for real though people, there is tons of music outthere that is not boring. you should check it out"
5,"When it comes to ""pop,"" people are use to hearing the crap played on the popular radio stations. Brittany Spears, and terribly horrid music like that. I want people to know the true meaning of ""pop"" music. Here it is in the dictionary:  ""a bland watered-down version of rock'n'roll with more rhythm and harmony and an emphasis on romantic love""  Now, before anyone bashes me, I don't agree with the ""bland"" and ""watered-down"" words, expecially in the case of Stephin Merrit, but it's true of the music played today. There's magic in this album. It's so full of life, and dare I say, the bliss of happiness. It's truly amazing how ""Wasps' Nests"" can completely change my perceptions. It puts me in a state of mind. Maybe I'm just a hopeless romantic, but this album happens to be the soundtrack to my life, as cheesy as that sounds. And no matter how cheesy the lyrics may be, You'll find yourself in love with them, almost as much as the luscious sound that is, ""The 6ths."" A masterpiece"
5,"Keane is one of the greatest bands of all time. The fact that they use piano/keyboards/bass/drums on every song, with no guitars at all, shows that they are more musically sophisticated than all the other mindless guitar rock that's out there. There are more than enough guitar-based bands. ""Somewhere Only We Know"" is the best song of all time. Beautiful lyrics, solid piano backbone, and a steady, moderate tempo, make it a brilliant album-opener. The album has upbeat pop/rock, like ""Bend and Break"" and ""This is the Last Time,"" slow, sorrowful ballads, like ""She Has No Time"" and ""We Might as Well be Strangers,"" gentle, peaceful melodies, like ""Sunshine,"" and slightly ethereal, unearthly ones like ""Untitled 1"" and ""Bedshaped."" Plus, all the lyrics are intensely personal and honest, ones that everyone can relate to, in one way or another. All together, the album is a classic, one that (if the American public knows anything about music) will live on to be known as one of the greatest albums ever made. Every song is a masterpiece. There are no fillers."
2,"I absolutely loved that song ""Carry On Wayward Son"" which sounds like one of the greatest stuff in history. Rest of the other songs on this album are not that good. 2-stars"
2,"Contrary to the previous review, I find that commenting on the quality of the mixing on this cd to be essential.  It has to be the sloppiest 'exhibition' of professional mixing that I've heard consigned to disc.  It just sounded like there was too much emphasis on getting as many tracks on in 70 mins, regardless of flow, or beat matching.  Very let down by this disc"
1,"The charming 1977 musical is not the subject of this note.  The show is great and the liner notes are superb. However, consumers should note that there is a critical flaw in the mastering (at least on the disc version that I obtained). It is very unfortunate that the manufacturers did not pull this mis-mastered version from the market. As noted elsewhere (and absolutely correct), an entire track of sound is lost and can only be heard distantly in the background.   If the problem is corrected and later discs are OK, it just compounds the problem with no way to know if you have a flawed disc or an OK disc. A most unfortunate problem for what should be a joyous recording"
5,"This is a great album.  It is perfect for doing chores at home, driving in the car or plugging away in the cubicle.  I took a chance on this ablum because I enjoyed ""pins"" and ""maps"" from fever to tell and I am glad I did.  ""Golden Lion"", ""Way Out"" and ""Cheated Hearts"" are my favorites. "
5,How to decribe this gem of a CD. There is such a gentle warm feeling to the songs. It appears that Steve Kilbey's voice is aging like a fine wine.  Great selection of songs with a sprinkling of five new ones.  I have always tried to get friends and coworkers to like the Church and this one is getting the warmest response. Any fan of the Church will enjoy and it is a great place to start for the curious
5,"Houston is doing it big.  Slim thug,Pall Wall, Chamillionare and Mike Jones.  All There albums are great.  But Slim thugs sticks out due to the neptunes.Like A Boss wouldn't have the same attitude if the neptunes hadnt made the beat. 1.Like A Boss 2.Click Clack 3.3 Kings 4.Already Platinum 5.I aint heard of that"
2,"Bland, bland, and more bland.  It seemed to be trying for some kind of emotional resonance, and fell far short of the mark.  With the except on the main character's mother, nearly every single character was completely unlikeable.  And a little Lea Delaria goes a long, long way.  It does replicate the 80s very well, but it just feels so devoid of humanity"
2,"Don't get me wrong. I'm a raging hippie, who's completely anti-war. And the lyrics on this album are great, and I love the cover of ""Imagine"" by John Lennon. But it seems that the actual desire to make good *music* fell to the back burner on this one. It's not that the songs are bad per se, but they're all fillers. It's an entire album of fillers, with no really great songs to bring them up. Overall, a disappointment, which is unfortunate, since the wonderful message is lost by the lack of lustre in the music.   If you're new to A Perfect Circle, pick one of the other albums. If you're a veteran, sure, pick it up. But I'd suggest listening to it on random with your other A Perfect Circle and Tool cd's"
5,"When Kylie released the single ""Spinning Around""...that's what it...Kylie was popular again...the difficult songs were history. It was time for new sex & dance Kylie. The single went number 1 in UK and it was a real success all over the world. The second single ""On a Night Like This"" went number 2 in UK and also ""Kids"" (a classic song made with Robbie Williams) went number 2. The album wen through the roof annd it was Kylie's time for her greatest success ever. Even the beginning of her carriere where she sang ""I Should Be So Lucky"" and ""The Loco-Motion"" can't be compared this time. There was released one more single in UK ""Please Stay"" which also went to top ten. ""Your Disco Needs You"" is so fresh and powerful that it is one my favourites from this album...the chorus is excellent...it's wonderful when Kylie uses a choir. ""Bittersweet Goodbye"" is a peaceful and sad song...Kylie's voice is very sad. Other songs are more like party songs and that's why this is recommended for everybody who wants to dance...or likes good music. By the way, what does ""I'm Under the Influence of Love"" means? I have an idea for that.  Stars: Spinning Around, On a Night Like This, Your Disco Needs You, Please Stay, Kid"
5,"I've just gotten hip to the Hotel Costes series by Stephane Pompougnac (so I'm 4 years behind with this review--please, bare with me!)...I'm one of those people who don't want to be left outta the loop when it comes to stuff--at any rate, I started buying this series outta order...I bought #5 first, #4 was too latin for me to purchase, #1 too expensive, and #3 was unavailable...soo, I decided on &quot;La Suite&quot; because of the unfamiliarity of the songs and artists on it. Well, some of them anyway. The ubiquitous &quot;Jazz Music&quot; by De-Phazz almost made me not buy this set, but I said, what the hell? It won't be the first time I bought a mix/comp CD with songs I've already seen or heard a million times already. How does that work anyway? What? Certain record labels/ mixers all bid on the same songs or something? ahem...As usual,I digress.  All that notwithstanding, &quot;La Suite&quot; was an entertaining delight and voyage into chill-house, as I so aptly pen music such as that remixed by Pompougnac. This whole series is tempting me to go ahead and buy 1, 3 and 4 no matter the cost.  Hey--I'm the type of music buyer who likes to own all volumes in a series, what can I say? Anyway, getting back to the review of &quot;La Suite&quot;, it's not as good as #5 (or from what I could sample on #1 in Borders), but it does have some stellar moments with the opening &quot;To Ulrike M.&quot; by Doris Days with a Zero 7 remix?? OK, Pompougnac, what gives? I thought these were supposed to be songs mixed by you?  Other stand out tracks are from 45 Dip (Check these guys out on the &quot;Acid Lounge in Space&quot; Comp CD), Sympatique (Now, this is true Parisian music despite it's &quot;cheesiness&quot; as one reviewer stated), Mo'Horizons (nice, as always), Palais Mascotte (strong dance floor appeal), I:Cube (hypnotic with a 60s feel), Pascal w/Mister Day (nice disco-track), Mr. Scruff (the song says it all), Boozoo Bajou (nocturanal) and Streetlife (cinematic and groovy, baby). This is a worthy investment for any Chill/House music fan.  The songs on Costes &quot;La Suite&quot; are refreshing and upbeat from beginning to end. Sure to impress even your most stiff-necked guests at your next get-together--you know the ones, they stand on the wall all night long with their half empty bottles of Corona trying desperately to look cool"
5,"If you're a fan of regular book musicals, this one is not for you!!! Passion is an operetta style love triangle that is complex, poignant, and beautiful. Stephen Sondheim's brillaint score ties the entrie musical together, which again helps him keep his genius status. The clever weaving of songs, scenes, and, most interestingly, letters, make for a great cast album.  As for performances, it's the females who own this show. Marin Mazzie is as glorious as ever as Clara (she's even better in Ragtime), and Tony-winner Donna Murphy brings all of the emotion forward in her portrayal of Fosca.  For those who are used to the usual Sondheim, this one may dissapoint. Others, however, will love this opera of love"
1,"Generally harmless, except for one very offensive song about siblings that hate each other and hate their parents.  The song is probably funny to ultra-sophisticated, cynical adults.  But the song is totally inappropriate for a four year old.  I wouldn't bring this CD into your house"
5,"Chamber Music seems so right during the boisterous mechanics of the holidays and one sure respite from the garish noise of the external season can be found in works like the Mendelssohn Piano Trios.  Here Eugene Istomin, Leonard Rose, Isaac Stern perform Piano Trios 1 and 2 in a manner that bespeaks camaraderie of the performers as well as a complete respect for these luminous works.  Some have called these works piano sonatas with obbligato and while for this listener that is an unfair judgment, Eugene Istomin plays the piano part with enough flair and thoughtful propulsion that he does at times sound the more important.  But that is Mendelssohn's writing and not a self-aggrandizement of a pianist.  The overall sound is simply superb. These two trios are some of the loveliest ever written from that era and the gentlemen performing them offer sophisticated and informed interpretations. The recording is excellent, the music is rarefied!  Highly recommended. Grady Harp, December 05"
1,"First of all what kind of name is Nelly? It sounds about as bad-ass as the Bee Gee's. And although Nelly isn't as bad as Chingy or Feminem, he isn't much of an improvement either. The lyrics are stupid, and often ridiculous (uh, 'Hot in Herre' anyone?), and he would go as far as rapping about sneakers, in that horrible excuse of a rap 'Air Force Ones'. 'Pimp Juice' has to be the worst song I've ever heard, well, next to 'The Real Slim Shady' by Butterfinger, er, Eminem. Nelly looks like a freakin' gorrila! And that stupid bandaide doesn't help him too much either. If I had to pick the five worst rappers in history they would be as follows: 5. Ludacris 4. Fat Joe 3. Nelly 2. Chingy 1. Eminem Nelly at 3...it doesn't take a genius to figure out that buying this is a bad decision. Jesus! Nelly makes 50 Cent look like Eazy E"
2,"I've been a huge fan of the Isleys for over 30 years, and stuck by them through the early Motown soul and their golden groove-funk period of the 1970s, through to the later stuff right up to the excellent Mission To Please album. But that's when they should have dumped R. Kelly, because it's the last album that had any really decent hook to it. And when you have a blistering guitarist like Ernie Isley, why bury him so far in the mix that his licks sound like they're being played through cotton wool?    R. Kelly's plodding grooves just grind from one indistinguishable track to another, which is pretty much the case on the even more disappointing follow-up to this, Body Kiss. The only track that kicks any ass here is the opener, Move Your Body, which fools you into thinking this might be a return to former glories for our heroes. Sadly, the leaden funk of R. Kelly then comes crashing in like a tidal wave of sludge and we get a whole turgid mess of leaden walking-pace 'grooves' that might sound all right in the background when you're getting it on with the partner of your dreams, but as listening music just gets you all exasperated and reaching for the 3+3 album again.    Come on, Isleys, dump the Kelly glop and get back to what you can do best"
2,"I had never heard Leonard Cohen's music but saw references to it frequently when looking at other singers/songwriters.  Given his status/reputation I thought I should get this CD and learn what all the fuss was about.  Having had no preconceptions, I have to say I was quite disappointed.  I think the music has not aged well and is pretty unremarkable.  Perhaps the style liberated others to pursue new directions but the work in and of itself is ho hum at best.  Specific example that speaks volumes:  listen to Cohen's singing of his ""Hallelujah"" and then listen to Jeff Buckley's cover of that song on ""Grace"" which was recorded in 1994.  Sorry, Leonard, you cannot hold even a birthday-sized candle to Jeff Buckley's rendition of your own song.  It is a very unflattering comparison that pretty much put the first and last nail in the coffin for my appreciation of Cohen's legacy.  ""Tant pis, vers le bonheur."
2,"My first exposure to Leonard Cohen was hearing Allison Crowe singing ""Hallelujah."" I was awestruck so I decided to get the Essential Leonard Cohen. Bad decision! The man barely breaks out of a monotone and sounds like he's terrified that someone will hear him above the accompaniment.  He's another artist who should continue writing but let others perform his works"
5,"There's no point in repeating what others here have said.  Had it not been for a chance perusal of the review in Rolling Stone, I never would have known about this CD.  It is a great, joyful rock album - I never even listened to the Dolls in years gone by - but this one nails the spirit of the genre.  I've worked backstage at Stones, AC/DC and Dead shows, and I modestly suggest that I know the real thing when I hear it.  Tear the shrink wrap off, baby, and crank this one up on the way home with the windows down, while the weather is still warm enough to do so!  If you're a guitarist, pay attention to what Syl is playing, and watch the video - he's really learned to do it right"
5,"Hey, what's up? This is my first review. At first I didn't feel it was necessary; Paul's Boutique already has five stars, and deserves every one of them. Still, the quality of this record compelled me to express my thoughts on it, too.  This album is near perfect. The only track I feel is weak (and it's not even that bad) is Egg Man. I didn't dig it at first... but it grew on me, so I'll give it a listen, now, especially for the sampling (as mentioned by another reviewer).  Every single track on the album is linked. I think this adds alot to it, because it's like a non-stop track. Very enjoyable. If you're looking for a great hip-hop album or want to get into the Beastie Boys, definitely cop this album. Solid Gold Hits isn't great, and the anthology isn't worth it. All Beastie Boys albums pale in comparison to this sucker. Get Paul's Boutique"
1,"I bought this CD because it got a lot of good reviews, and the description sounded like something I would enjoy. However, it turned out to be an atrocious CD. It is very repetitive and monotonous throughout. The songs pretty much all sound the same. There's little melodic variation, and the vocals have basically no range. The lyrics are extremely uninspired. I'm glad I bought this used at a cheap price. I don't know if I'm going to give it away or just throw it away; it's that bad."
1,"And what's the deal with the CD cover? Anyway..I have always found her voice to be too breathy,too mannered,and trying too hard to be sexy.I just do not like her singing.I tried.I couldn't get into it.Give me Ella or June or Sarah.Now that's singing.Sorry Krall fans"
5,"I was introduced to Sissel through a recent trip to Norway.  She has a voice of an Angel!  Through buying this CD, which I listen to in the car on the way to and from work, for a relaxing mood, I have been introduced to her other CD's.  Wish they were more available in the USA.  I really enjoy this album"
1,I saw on the internet a picture of chingy rapping on stage and a notorious porn transvestite with HIS hand on chingy's crotch. Now I knew chingy couldn't rap his way out of a wet paper bag but I never questioned his manhood. Now that I saw the picture and read the article about Chingy and his transvestite lover I am so done with him. I hope the reviews he gets encourages him to find another occupation. This album is classic garbage and would be a perfect coaster for the next party you have at your house
5,"I bought this CD because I loved the song NOTHING CATCHES JESUS BY SURPRISE!  Then I found that this CD is packed full of HITS.  It is nice to hear so many of his songs played on the radio, not just one or two from this CD.  It shows the quality of work that goes into the CD and it reflects in his singing"
1,"Having been born in '86, I unfortunately did not yet exist to experience the late '70's punk movement or was too young to be part of the '80's hardcore years. Instead, I got to grow up with the MTV generation.... how so very lucky I am. Yet, I figured out the difference between real music and the junk mainstream media keeps referring to as ""punk"". So, if I could figure it out, any other idiot from this forsaken generation shouldn't have any problems. Good Charlotte is okay if you're 8 years old, but if you're 13 and you're still listening them you need to just grow up and listen to much better stuff. If you're my age and you listen to Good Charlotte then you are beyond any help.  Instead of Good Charlotte, buy or steal the real thing: Subhumans:Time Flies + Rats. It was the first one I picked up and it led to an entire collection of real, gritty, raw punk music. To all the Good Charlotte fans, take the advice I just gave you. Go from whining about how much your life sucks to actually doing something about it."
4,Very good movie - fantastic lead dancer.  Music is good but a mix and not all danceable.  All in all good movie & good soundtrack. 
1,"Everybody seems to think this band is innovative or something. They sound exactly like 'Beard of Stars' era T-rex. Well, almost, because AC does a lot more layering with tons of effects. What are they hiding? The lyrics?  Anyway, if you're going to rip people off, you should give props. Shame on Animal Collective"
5,"This is one of the greatest hip hop albums I've ever listened to. In my opinion, Murs has never sounded so good. His flows are vivid and realistic and the production fitted them to the Tee. I thought every song was extremely dope. I highly recommend this in your collection. I know this review will not make me popular w/many but I have to write it how I honestly feel. Save the negative remarks for someone who cares. I know Murs is not the best MC of all time. I'm not sayin that. He's far from it. I'm sayin this is my 2nd favorite album of all time simply for the overall feelings I get from it every time I put it on. I'm sure if you want some heart-felt/feel-good Hip Hop music this will suit you. Peac"
1,"Alright, I will state that I was curious about this band about four years ago. I thought to myself: ""Good Charlotte can't be that bad if they have so many 'hardcore' fans that go everywhere, buy everything and speak anything that is to do with Good Charlotte."" Man, was I wrong. Good Charlotte sucks. They're basically a boy band that wears black clothes and wears eyeliner. Their music sounds like sped up emo music. You could describe their music as ""emo with estrogen"". MTV markets them to the teenybopper crowd. How so many young, impressionable kids can get suckered hook, line, and sinker into ANY of the garbage that this pathetic excuse of a band dumps onto them is beyond me. They definitely appeal to 12 year old kids, who have such a horrible life because they can't go to the mall and buy new clothes or get a new video game.  They are a whiny band that love to sing about how ""horrible"" and ""tragic"" their life is, meanwhile they are sitting in cash in their mansions. No one cares except for their legions of self-pitying fans who feel they can truly connect with GC's ""deep"" and ""inspiring"" so-called ""music"". They even have whiny ballads that sound like the rest of the ""pop-punk"" and ""emo"" genres at the moment. Yeah, GC is fuelled by teen angst and armed with extremely bad talent. I'm sorry kiddies but Good Charlotte is nothing more than pop. I'm 16 & I'm already getting tired of the new music because it is getting horrible & more horrible. It's a manufactured popularity contest now. With their mediocre cliched song lyrics, Good Charlotte are 100% worshipped by their demographic, pre-teen and teenage preppy girls (and flamer guys.) This group of pop icons do nothing more than create crappy music (which is charged to audiences at well over $50 per ticket) and find themselves on MTV acting like jackasses every chance they aquire for the pleasure of their braindead viewers.  Their fanbase consists of 12 year olds that think they know all about music, therefore claim that they have the right to say that ""GC"" are musical gods or are the ""best punk rawk band eva!111!1!"", while talented bands like The Beatles and Pink Floyd to them are ""old"" and ""horrible"". These 12 year olds can usually be found online, usually on message boards, with usernames like ""XxGCIsDaBestPunkBandEvarxX"" and ""trU3_pUnk_raWk3r"".  Conversations between members of their fan base may be similar to this:  Poser: I love Good Charlotte they're so punk they're so much cooler than all those other pop bands. Kid #2: Where did you hear them first? Poser: TRL, oh, and in Hot Topic.  Poser: Hey, wanna, like, go to a Good Charlotte concert next month? Poser 2: Yeah! And we can wear our studded bracelets and red and black pants that we bought at Hot Topic!  Teenybopper talking to herself: ""Oh my gaaaawd. I hate my liiiife. I can relate to these guys sooooo much because nobody listens to me and everyone hates meee""  Ugh.  In the end, I recommend the following punk rock albums to those who have been victimized by Good Charlotte:  Raw Power - Iggy and the Stooges Ramones - The Ramones London Calling - The Clas"
5,"In my opinion, John Cage's In A Landscape is THE most beautiful peice for piano of absolute all time.  Never has there been a classical peice for this instrument that truely got to me personally than this.  And never will there ever be.  In A Landscape goes beyond 'music' and is an entity in itself that speaks on many levels.  It's so simple and yet is so powerful.  This is a must for any music lover or/and a person who would like to get to know the many works of John Cage"
5,"No importa lo que haga, no importa lo que cante, el es el mejor.  Yo no tengo que escuchar un disco de el para comprarlo, el solo hecho de que sea el es suficiente para mi.  Me gusto el disco y me encanto su nuevo look"
4,"For some Born in the USA is the greatest the Boss ever delivered, for others it's the start of a steady decline. Often mistaken for an overly patriotic statement this album found Bruce suddenly among the ranks of eighties superstars as Prince, Madonna and Michael Jackson. Born in the USA is the reason why some place the Boss in the same category as Jon Bon Jovi, Born in the USA sounds as a stadium blow-out. Yet lyrics as ""Born down in a dead man's town, The first kick I took was when I hit the ground, You end up like a dog that's been beat too much, Till you spend half your life just covering up"" could hardly be called patriotic or shallow.  Born in the USA was the follow-up for Nebraska, a sparse demo-like recording. A lot of the material here was culled from those sessions and had the E-Street bravura added to them. The title track was originally a one-man rockabilly outing but transformed in E-Street synth-rock. The same treatment songs as Dancing in the Dark, Glory Days or I'm on Fire got. It's that treatment that's ultimately the weakness of the record. Today Born in the USA sounds hopelessly dated at times. The listener is forced to listen beyond the production for its depth and meaning. At the time of its release it was no different. A lot of the lyrics meanings tend to get lost in the poppy production that made it so successful. It is also one of Springsteen least cohesive efforts. The styles on the album range from pop to rockabilly, from stadium rock to folk. For those who take the effort to dig deeper into the record there is a wealth in the songs that is rarely matched by other artists.  As never before Springsteen paints a picture of those of us who fail to be a part of the American Dream. There is the obvious post-Vietnam protest song of the title track, not allowing us to forget, and its attack on Reaganism. But there is more. In I'm on Fire the character bears his soul as Bruce sings, ""At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet, and a freight train running through the, middle of my head, Only you can cool my desire"". Sex being the means through which the character forgets his angst for just a moment. Similar sentiments are found in Dancing in the Dark, Bruce's ultimate pop effort. ""Man I'm just tired and bored with myself"" screams the character, ""Hey there baby, I could use just a little help"", hardly a light and upbeat lyric. The people in Springsteen's songs seem to be stuck in their lives, unable to get ahead. The chances the American Dream offers us are accessible only to just some of us. The rest are left behind ""just sitting back trying to recapture, a little of the glory of, well time slips away and leaves you with nothing mister but, boring stories of glory days"""
5,"They've inducted that Macolm Mclaren money-making hype ""punk"" band the Sex Pistols into the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame (McLaren's other great creation was Bow Wow Wow) who arrived two years after the CBGB thing in New York in '74 (Brit kids seeing the Ramones on tour was far more influential on the punk scene there than anything the pistols did). Those laughable geezers Black Sabbath have been inducted (though they had their moments in their early albums). Even Billy Joel is an inductee (thanks to the evil & damned for eternity Jann Wenner)!! But neither the Stooges nor Iggy are to be found listed; their first album came out in 1969, which would have made them elegible in 1994; 12 years of tripe. A lot of people need to get a lot of hate mail for this omission. Then again, perhaps NOT being in the R'nR hall of fame is the last sign of integrity as this genre of music truly dies a slow, ugly, painful death (see ""alternative"" music since the early '90's leading to the likes of Avril Levine or . . . or any other ""serious"", ""sensitive"" ""hip"" whiney, over-hyped, worthless bands these days). "
2,"Some of us have been through years where the Beastie Boys were always playing in at least one of the tape decks in our dual tape players (that's cassette tapes, in case you are too young to know).  Anyway, I was hoping for another album that would stay (now in my 5-disc changer) for at least a full year without my having to swap it out.  Unfortunately, this is not what I got in this album.  While there are tracks on this album that capture the energy and passion of the Beastie Boys of old, too much of this record feels like preaching. Although I agree with much of what they have to say, they now do so in such a politically over-hyped fashion that it detracts from their music.  Truly, there are some great songs on this record.  But if you listen to this album and then to Paul's Boutique, Licensed to Ill or another great one, you will quickly realize that this is not the Beastie Boys who revolutionized music in the late 20th century"
1,"First of all, Jump is too good of a track. I still haven't heard the rest of this CD because I just put jump on repeat and rap at the top of my lungs on my 45 minute commute. It ends up being about 10 times each way to work and if I'm at a long light, I look a little nuts for rapping to the song twice, but like I've always told people, if yelling a rap song by 12 year olds at the top of your lungs is wrong, I don't want to be in prison. The other problem I have with this thing is that if you try to be like Kriss Cross, you can't hold a job. If you are a true Kriss Krosser, you braid your hair and wear your clothes backwards. I got a job with a bank when I graduated from the U of Phoenix and I showed up on my first day with my suit on backwards. I started getting a bunch of customer complaints and they would call my Manager, Mr. Gingercrap, up to tell me they had a problem with my attire. Little did they know that I wired the intercom system to play Jump by the rap kings. I just pushed play and got on the drive thru teller mic and busted a groove in my reverse suit. I got fired. Well, after getting fired six other times from places like Burger King, Jiffy Lube, Ted pants shack, Jorks and Microsubs I decided to be a roller rink cop. I make kids leave the floor if they skate too fast. If they resist my orders, I have a tazer that I use without hesitation. I usually whisper for them to leave the rink so they say they can't hear me. Stop! Tazer time!! They don't care how I dress and pay me like 5 buks an hour. Yup, I'm at another level"
4,"I first need to say, if it weren't for the DVD and all of its features, ANYWHERE BUT HOME would have gotten three stars. I say this because, Evanescence does not sound as good live as they do in the studio.   THE CD: This contains the audio to the rock band's performance live in Paris. It also has the album's most beautiful and stand out track: ""Missing"".  THE CONCERT: The overall sound balance for this rock band is way off for this performance and the distorted guitars tend to drown out anything in the form of a musical line. Amy Lee also has her share of troubles for this performance. She can sing her high loud notes pretty well, but her lower ones tend to be in a constant use of pedal tones. Late into the performance, Amy's voice cracks and even starts to give out on her. She does however, know how to work the crowd. The bands newer tracks are well performed, and the covers they perform sound better than their own work. This is good and bad; it shows that Evanescence can play pretty well, but they need a lot more practice playing live and communicating with each other live. The best part to this concert is getting to see the beautiful Amy Lee perform and add new and very interesting introductions to some of the band's songs.  Awesome performances include: ""Thoughtless"" ""Breathe No More"" ""Farther Away"" ""Bring Me to Life"" ""Whisper""  DVD FEATURES: This disc is awesome because it has so many features. It of course has Evanescence's performance in Paris. It also has music videos for ""Going Under"", ""Bring Me to Life"", ""Everybody's Fool"", and ""My Immortal"". There is also a hidden video icon of Evanescence's band symbol. When this is activated, another live performance of ""Bring Me to Life"" is played. The disc also has tons of rehearsal, bloopers, and on the road footage; including Evanescence's tour with Seether. The credits also have the audio to Evanescence's newest track ""Missing"". ANYWHERE BUT HOME is an interesting concert and a fun look into Evanescence's life, I recomend viewing it"
1,Another great player selling out to sell more.  Seems like another outbreak of the Kenny bug.  I'm sure any jazz aficianado would agree with me when I say that Gerald Albright is a much more comprehensive player than this album suggets.   Check out the 'Live at Birdland West' album for a taste of what Mr. Albright is really about.
1,THIS IS A GREAT CD IF YOU ARE A MUSIC LOVER AS I AM.BILLY COBHAM IS ONE OF THE GREATEST DRUMMERS EVER!!!
2,"I purchased Hotel Costes backwards from 6,5,4 and then 2. I don't know why I skipped 3 and bought 2 first.  But 3 and 1 isn't worth listening to, unless you want the whole collection of the Hotel Costes series"
2,"I wanted to like BROTHERHOOD, for the simple reason that nearly every New Order fan this side of the galaxy has dismissed it, usually with a faint whiff of snobbery (or at least apathy). Turns out they were right: BROTHERHOOD is half an album. Most of its nine songs feel unfinished, as if the band wanted to cash in on the success of their 1985 smash LOW-LIFE and didn't care about the end result. BROTHERHOOD is a rush job, plain and simple, but there are still glimmers of hope within this bare-bones effort.   ""As It Is When It Was"" overcomes the album's overall muddy production by dint of being mostly acoustic, and the melody is quite lovely. ""All Day Long"", the emotional centerpiece of the album by default, is an intelligent (if half-hearted) protest against child abuse. While ""Angel Dust"" lacks a decent hook, its subtly danceable beat and effective synth noodlings will at least briefly hold your interest. And the toss-off ""Every Little Counts"" has a charming sense of humor that is too often lacking in New Order's work.  The most popular song on BROTHERHOOD is, of course, ""Bizarre Love Triangle"". So good it seems to belong to a different album entirely, ""Bizarre Love Triangle"" is truly New Order's masterpiece. The solid beat, slick sequencer work, and gorgeous melody showcase the band at their best: catchy, danceable, and downright euphoric. (Imagine how well it would have fit on LOW-LIFE.)  Sadly, the rest of BROTHERHOOD is unremarkable. The album's production neatly mixes rock with electronic flourishes, which has become New Order's signature sound, but the songwriting doesn't measure up. Buy the album if you're a trainspotter, but casual New Order fans would be better off picking up LOW-LIFE or 1983's POWER, CORRUPTION AND LIES. This one is just a footnote."
1,"Somewhere in the universe, statistically speaking, there has to be a band more stultifying than Rush. It's hard to imagine that God could be so cruel, but remember, she gave us Boston (the band, that is) too. This stuff is so painful, it almost makes rap sound good"
2,"god forbid i be so bold as to trash a classic.  and yes, maybe because of all the raving reviews from my friends and from the book's great reputation, i entered it with high expectations. - which the book however did not satisfy.  yes, it is a good comedic parody of the upper class of the time, a lampoon of the courtship ritual, and of course oh so witty, blah blah blah, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.  the main character was likeable, but that aside, i found it completely insufferable to read through, and absolutely painfully boring.  every subsequent event from the very beginning could be predicted, let alone the ending.  not that anything really ever happens - the entire book could be summed up with, ""then they walked and talked and had tea and walked and talked and had tea, walked and talked and had more tea, then got married and lived happily ever after.""  the entire novel was a headache of girly gossip and mental drama.  it would save more time just to watch a chick flick.  so if you're interested in the relationship fiascos of fictious characters, witnessing the agony over who's going to marry who (even though the reader could already predict the happily-ever-after match-making light-years in advance), then this is the book for you!!  if not, then i suggest picking up some dan brown.           "
5,"First of all i love the pet shop boys they take me back to the decade of the 80's with this collection!!!! Each song has a untique flavor to them and they are so much fun to listen to again and again!!!!! With the beginning of the album which would be ""West End Girls"" to "" Jealously""!!!!!! If you love the pet shop boys then go buy this album not because of the band,but for the great 80 songs that take us back in the day!!!"
5,"Old school. If you have a teen into rap this is a great alternative to ""SHOW THE PUPS"" how it was done before all women were treated as dirt in videos and and gangsters were hero's. The topic is party. the beat is rap/rock and it the ""BOYS"" influenced many of todays artists. And the infamous Brass Monkey song is still HOT HOT HOT. If you're a fan of any rap or roc or a parent that wants to add some depth to your teen's gangster heavy library-head to the old school kind of cool and you will find music you can both live with"
5,"This is undoubtably the Beasties' best CD. There still great now, but on here they're more Rap/Rock, which they left behind later on for straight up rap/hip-hop, which isn't a bad thing. Most rap nowadays really sucks goats(*cough*cough50centmikejonesliljonseanpaulpaulwall *cough*cough). This great disc features such classics as Girls, No Sleep Til' Brooklyn(the Beasties best song), Rymin and Stealin(which has a rather nice tribute to The Clash), Fight For Your Right, Hold it Now Hit It, And the infamous Brass Monkey. If you're a fan of any rap or rock, I highly reccomend this amazing CD"
2,"I'm a huge fan of Dream Theater, owning all their studio albums, and some singles. I loved SFAM, I&W, SDOIT, and Awake. After their peak at SFAM, I didn't expect them to release anything better. But I didn't expect them to release anything that was too bad.  They did.  Octavarium, flat out, isn't Dream Theater. No guitar or drum solos, not flourishes, no pretenstious and self-indulgent metal peices. Buy this if you like U2 or Coldplay, don't buy it if you like Dream Theater."
1,"Seriously, folks...this band SUCKS! Every one of these hits (Dancing Queen, Sugar Sugar, Mamma Mia, Take a Chance on Me) is dated, sugary, and awful as awful gets. How they scored any hits whatsoever is beyond me. KEEP AWAY!!!!!!!"
5,Break down and burn your fence for this one. It is worth the fumes. I was living in a place in Tucson for this release and we burnt the whole fence down
1,"Nelly is one of the most annoying ignorant rappers I have ever heard. I do give him props on his first album, but he went downhill and started that whole ""I can make great club beats, but write bubblegum lyrics over it"" trend. This sadly created all the Chingys, Lil Johns and so on. The guy doesn't add any substance to his music, yet he sells millions thanks to MTV. Just save your money on real artist that makes real music"
4,"Passion, a collection of some of the most popular young worship leaders (including Chris Tomlin, Charlie Hall, Matt Redman and David Crowder) released Hymns Ancient & Modern in 2004. There is some interpretation of the hymns, and a couple have a chorus added to them, but on the whole the artists stay quite close to the traditional tunes. To ""O Worship The King,"" for example, Chris Tomlin adds the chorus, ""You alone are the matchless King / To you alone be all majesty / Your glories and wonders, what tongues can recite? / You breathe in the air, You shine in the light."" Some of the standouts on this album are ""The Solid Rock,"" ""All Hail the Power of Jesus' Name,"" and ""All Creatures of Our God and King."" The liner notes include a brief description of each of the songs along with information about the author. It is quite a good album if you enjoy the ""Passion"" sound and are able to enjoy hymns with a bit of a worship music feel to them"
1,"Wack rhymes make me puke via my ear canal. That's how wack Paul Wall is. After I have eaten a full meal and listened to Paul wall, My dinner is regurgitated through my ears. I am sooooooooooo tired of these garbage rappers polluting the airwaves with garbage. This guy wouldn't know lyrical content if I slapped him with a Mos Def CD"
4,"The first CD is 5 stars.  It has great continuity that carries over from track to track.  The combination of vocals and non-vocals is just right because you don't feel burnt out by one or the other.  One of the cooler parts about the first CD is tracks such as Under the Sun make excellent use of your left and right speaker channels.  There is this weird echo effect that moves from your left to right speaker that is amazing if you have a good sound system.  Normally music makes inefficient use of the speaker channels, but a few songs selected by Armin goes against this trend.  These days there is a lot of good electronic music out there, but messing with the speaker channels immerses you even more in the acoustic environment.  All the songs Armin picked become remember able classics once you hear them several times because a few do sound monotonous.  The second CD is 3 stars.  It doesn't have the energy and momentum that CD1 has and there aren't as many vocal tracks to break up the electronic beats.  Armin could probably have introduced more variety into CD2 such as breakbeat, house, and tribal, but it is what it is.     "
2,"Despite all the rave reviews I'm wondering if this is a dreaded rerecord. Maybe I'm paranoid, but the country music industry is so sleazy. And some stars feel entitled to cash in. How else can you explain the John Anderson Anthology...Horror.  (John, how could you?) Or the Bill Anderson Oh Boy Classic [Oh boy here comes a rerecord). Hey, the CD sounds great. But what makes me suspiscious is that there are no copyright dates anywhere on this CD except for one. Also the cryptic message on the inside sleeve.  Could someone please clear this up. And not some RCR Bud Logan shill either. John Conlee is one of my hero's and this is really worrying me. I can't look at this CD with Rose Colered Glasses anymore"
5,"Ever since they vanished from the music world, I've been searching the airwaves for just a hint of anything ""Catherine Wheel"" and then BLAM I hit Rob Dickinson's solo album while slogging through I-tunes.  Ahhh that voice....Ahhh those lyrics...seductive, intelligent.....wonderful. I'm in love with music once again."
1,"Well what the hell to expect from a big cynical misanthrope such as myself?  Flowery bubbly warm rays of sunshine?  HELL NO!  You see folks it's people like Lil Jon that make me think in such a morbid manner.  When I see Special Ed. failures who look and act like mental house rejects make lots of money I tend to get a little pessimistic.  BUT CAN YOU BLAME ME?  Seriously, let's screw our heads on tightly and think about this for a second, why would a sane person actually listen to let alone actually purchase this cd?  This is a complete joke.  I'm simply calling it like I see it.  Lil Jon deserves no respect from any human being, not even his crack head of a mother.    Actually you might as well compare Lil Jon to Elmo, Elmo being a puppet has a MILLION times more skill at what he does.  At least Elmo is a good and wholesome children's icon that kids can have fun with.  If I ever have a kid someday Elmo will still be a hit with the kids but Lil Jon will still be laughed at once all his ""fans"" grow up and realize how stupid they were to actually buy into his garbage he pans off as ""music"".  Meh, well who I am kidding this review (like my last 6) probably won't even get posted anyway. "
1,"It's simply not the best of Sting '84-'94.  The version of We'll Be Together (a great song) is an alternate take (mix?), VASTLY inferior to the album / radio version.  It's anemic.  Lacks the punch.  In a word -- sucks.  That you're not told this on the cover is misleading.  I really enjoy Mr. Sumner's music.  All the other tunes are as they should be, and they are terrific.  4-5 stars.  But don't buy this product if you expect to hear what you've heard on the album or the radio"
5,I have been a fan of Sting ever since I was in college.  I actually got to see him in person in the late 80's.  I have just about every cd he has ever put out so when this one did I ran right out and bought it.  Every song on it is great and it IS one of my most favorite cd's I own.   
5,"After leaving The Police in 1984, Sting launched a hugely successful solo career, garnering top selling albums and a string of top forty hits. In 1994, A & M released ""Fields Of Gold: The Best Of Sting 1984-1994"", a 14 song collection containing almost all of Sting's hits up to that time as well as some new recordings.  Well, 10 years has passed since its release, and Sting has made some new recordings. So the question is, how does ""Fields Of Gold"" hold up? Here are the positives and the negatives.  Positives: -If you're a casual fan only interested in having Sting's radio hits, than this collection is for you, as it includes ""If You Love Somebody (Set Them Free)"", ""Fortress Around Your Heart"", ""Be Still My Beating Heart"", ""Russians"", ""We'll Be Together"", ""All This Time"", ""If I Ever Lose My Faith In You"" and ""Fields Of Gold"". So basically, all the hits you could possibly want are here. -The sound is great. -It is a very afforable and easy to find compilation. -It includes some songs recorded for the album that are only available here. They're all good songs, especially the hit single ""When We Dance"".  Negatives: -This collection is missing a top twenty hit: ""Love Is The Seventh Wave"" reached number 17 in 1986. That's my main caveat. -""Mad About You"" was never a single (at least in the U.S.) but received a lot of airplay, enough to warrant inclusion on this cd. -Some of these songs are remixes. However, they work, though I prefer the original version of ""We'll Be Together"". -No liner notes. -As I said, this collection is leaving out later hits like ""I'm So Happy I Can't Stop Crying"", ""Brand New Day"" and the top twenty hit ""Desert Rose"". So if you want to get those songs, you'll have to get the albums they're on.  Overall, ""Fields Of Gold"" holds up very well. It is completely unneccessary for hardcore Sting fans (unless they're completists), but if you're a casual fan, than you must own this collection"
1,Sorry...  I expected the original lineup when I purchased this CD.  Now I'll have to go looking for all the songs that are missing...  Buyer Beware
5,"A great show makes a great CD. I will never understand why this show didn't become a hit! I saw this show at a local amateur theater and have loved it ever since. Maltby and Shire are the best composer and lyricists to never have a successful B'way show. This score is great- Fatherhood Blues, I Want It All, The Story Goes On, The Ladies Singing Their Song- These are unforgetable and deserved to be heard. Get this gem"
2,"Before getting steamed at the title of my review, take time and read my review in an objective sense. My critical anaylsis of this album was done strictly as objective as possible. I took my time listening to every single ""song"" on this album, so this isn't an uninformed review. Now to the review. ------------------------------------------------------------  Hell on Earth, Mobb Deeps third release, came out during the era of the media-fabricated and infamous east-coast-west-coast beef. Throughout the album, you get a sense that the artist where suffucated by the negative climate of the time. The songs and lyrics on this album, in every way, reflect that era. Starting off the album is a deep bass mixed with a dark-drum line instrumental. Havoc and Prodigy lace the beat with self glorifying, tough guy lyrics that accentuate the grimy instrumental. Though this album has 14 tracks, you've be hardpressed to differentiate one from the other if it wasn't for the switch of beat. The level of variation in subject matter on this album is so limited that a review of one tracks lyrics will tell you all you need to know about the album, lyric wise. There are little to no song concepts on this album. Nearly every single track on Hell on Earth is polluted with numerous references to someone getting shot, how much better Prodigy and Havoc are than you, and how they are from Queensbridge, etc. Through the lyrical context of this album, you almost get the sense that Mobb Deep was too consumed with the negative climate of rap at the time. You get the sense that they're lashing out at anyone and everyone that may pose as a potential threat to them. Cuts like ""Drop a gem on them"" and ""Bloodsport"" find them verbally attacking the late Tupac Shakur. The lyrics on this album get so rediculous at times that you have to wonder what these guys were thinking. You truely have to sit back and question how these guys could put out track after track of the same tired material. About the only saving grace of this album is the instrumentals. Dark, grimey, and horror movie like, they paint a background of horror and terror. Though good, the instrumentals of this album also start to sound repetitive as you get deeper into the album. After a while, they all start to sound like a cluster of the same stuff.  I'm sorry, but in no way shape or form is this as great of an album as some have stated. Lack of variation in topics, Ignorant, mindless gun and thug brovado give this album no depth. If you're someone that is looking for intelligent lyrics or creative concepts, do yourself a favor and avoid Hell on Earth at all cost"
5,"I love Saving Jane and the songs off this album are GREEAT! It's flippin awesome times a gazillion,a MUST BUY! Saving Jane ROCKS, no doubt!&lt;33"
1,"This musician, if you can call him that, should be embarrassed.  If he has something to say, more people would listen if he didn't use such vulgar language and stopped talking about his body parts.  I won't be buying this and my kids won't either.  Repulsive"
5,Alan Jackson is my favorite country singer. This is one of my favorites. I love every hymn that he has done. I play it constantly and it brings back memories. His wife and daughter did very well. One of his best!! 
4,all college students should watch st. elmos fire and all 80's babies should get the soundtrack to remind them the good ol days
5,"Eric Clapton speaks to the heart and soul and makes you smile and bop every time you listen.  He takes you out of your current space and into other places, leaving you enriched by the journey"
1,"WHAT A LOUSY MOVIE! AND I READ NOTHING BUT GLOWING REVIEWS ABOUT THIS CONVOLUTED PIECE OF BAD ACTING, BAD STORIED MOVIE. PLEASSSEEE, SAVE YOUR MONEY THIS IS A BAD MOVIE, BORING AND ALL-AND-ALL A LOUSY STORY. I DON'T RECOMMEND IT"
1,"Do you remember the guy in high school or college who tried to be the class clown but failed miserably? Well, Eugene Mirman is less entertaining than that guy.  I'm not being sarcastic about the pity laughter... that's the most laughter here, and yes, this was recorded live. How the record company heard this and still felt comfortable releasing it is beyond me. Perhaps it's a tax write-off"
4,"This album is the single reason Jewel is what she is today.  Without this album I feel that Jewel would never have been able to establish herself musically, at least not to the point of success she has today.  Raw, Untraditional, Brave, Naked, these can all descibe her first album.  Unlike most other hit records this album is a nice departure from the norm.  Worth a listen"
1,"Do you think if I wrote some nursery rhyme lyrics from bizzaro world and starting singing in a voice more suited to Sesame Street that I could get a record contract too like Devendra Banhart? His record has to be some kind of inside joke, or the efforts of one seriously untalented individual. Sprouting nonsensical phrases one after the other might pass as genius among some people but I want a bit more substance to my music. I found this record personally insulting because it's obvious that someone out there felt you can just put out any old crap filled with ""strange and fantastic"" lyrics that are ultimately meaningless and people would evitably go out and buy it because it's 'unique' and that your uncool if you don't get 'it' (whatever 'it' is). If you want to listen to a quality record by a singer-songwriter than go check out Bright Eyes' ""I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning"" or Damien Rice's ""O"" and steer clear of this insult to good taste"
1,This music is a rip off. All is borrowed to the 4 first albums of Marc Bolan playing under the name of Tyranosaurus Rex. Something more bluesy here and there but nothing allowing to give any credit to this guy.  A shame
5,"I saw the music video for this song a few days ago and it was stuck in my head for days! Canadian singer Daniel Powter is definitely talented, and it shows in his first single. I cannot wait for his self-titled album to be released in October so that I can listen to the rest of the songs."
5,"This is the first T.M.R. cd I ever bought and it truly made me into a fan. It's got great upbeat songs like Abort//Clear and Out of Orbit and classics like Invoke (gundam Seed) and Heart of Sword (Rurouni Kenshin). He has a truly unique voice and can really touch your soul. (Even if you can't understand what he's saying, it's cool. Go look for translations then!) Anyway, I reccomend this cd to any Jpop or Jrock fan. He truly is a great artist that I think you'll enjoy time and time again. 5stars baby 5 stars! Holla"
5,"I love T.M. Revolutions music, it is just so upbeat and so awesome their are hardly any words !  I love this CD, I listen to it all the time!  My favorite tracks are Invoke, Meteor, and Heart of Sword!  He is such an awesome singer!  I highly recommend his music to anyone who is into jpop or wanting to get into jpop! "
1,"During Pearl Jam's riot act tour in 2003, Sleater Kinney was  the opening band.I got tickets for the show. In preperation  for the concert, I picked up a few kinney albums. First this one. For one I had heard songs at the college station I worked and since one member Janet weiss was in Quasi( a great band) I thought it couldn't be all bad. At  first listening to the albums it was alright. Then it got  annoying. Those high pitched screams from the singer began to be fingernails on a chalkboard. Repetitive, middle of the road punk. Then came the concert. Once Sleater hit the stage, everyone and I mean everyone around me had no clue who they were. They were all asking me, who's this? I had to tell them all. No one was digging the concert. Minamal applause. No dancing or cheering, nothing. The songs that night didn't flow. The usual screaming was,as always, ear screeching and annoying. A few people mis-took the bassist for a man, but we were in the nose-bleed seats. Once sleater-kinney did their  last song and walked off stage the audience clapped with much enthusiasim, cause they knew they were finally done"
1,Maybe it's just me and I'm expecting so much when I spend my money or a little bit of time listenin' to these new n*ggas. But I'm just not feelin' this s*it here. I fell asleep mid way through this album. I just can't seem to understand why these n*ggas is so one dimesional. I cant underdstand why people still supportin' these n*ggas. Not one track was tolerable. If dis cd belonged to me i would threw this s*it away already. Word of advice dont buy this.
4,"After Ja Rule rose in popularity throughout the years since his debut, ""Venni Vetti Vecci"" in 1999, now in 2003 lots of things have changed.  50 Cent and his G-Unit crew rose up from the streets of New York and took the rap game by storm and their goal was to destroy Ja Rule and expose him as a poser.  After numerous disses throughout the years when 50 and his clique were in the underground scene til 2003, Ja Rule's career slowly began to crumble before his eyes.  So with this release, ""Blood in My Eye,"" Ja is out to prove that he still got that gangsta s*** in him.  Can Ja turn his career back around or will it further put him in the grave?  1. Murder (Intro) - No Rating  2. The Life (Featuring Hussein Fatal, Caddillac Tah & James Gotti) - 4/5  3. Clap Back - Minute+ Talking Intro - 4/5  4. The Crown (Featuring Sizzla) - 4/5  5.

Blood in My Eye (Featuring Hussein Fatal) - 4/5  13. It's Murda (Freestyle)[Bonus Track](Featuring Hussein Fatal) - 4/5  14. The Wrap (Freestyle)[Bonus Track](Featuring Hussein Fatal) - 3.5/5  Overall:  41/50  4 Stars  Ja Rule does indeed return to his roots.....somewhat.  Mostly every track has Ja spitting with anger dissing 50, Eminem, DMX, Dr. Dre and mostly every other rapper who dissed him.  He still got some pretty hot radio tracks but most of the album is filled with semi-hardcore tracks.  This was the first ""flop"" in Ja Rules career.  This album barely pushed over 400,000 units to date.  Still a pretty good record though, check it out"
1,"This is what occured when I heard this album. I immediately had to run to the bathroom and crap my life out. And guess what?!?!?!?!?! There was blood in my stool. Damn you jeffery for polluting this world with your awful lyrics, curse you for wasting beats, and shame on you for calling this album ""blood in my eye"" when you don't even know the history behind the book called ""blood in my eye"". Listen to us Ja quit rapping and go work at kfc"
1,"This is an awful record.  The beats are a complete joke.  Whoever produced this crap must have been strung out or somethin', cuz no1 in there right mind would let this sh** see the light of day.  And everyone already knows ja can't write so it's expected that the lyrics would be trash too.  Forget this record.  Murder Inc is dead"
5,"I had the opportunity to see Tom Braxton play for an extremely happy crowd at his almamader, Dunbar Middle School (then Dunbar High School). ""Julian's Smile"" and ""Bounce"" are superbly played, smoothe and fresh sound. See him live if you get the chance, buy the CD anyway"
5,My daughters and I love this CD.  It is fun to sing along and we have a great time listening to it.  I think that the songs provide my children with exposure to older music which is much different from the sounds they usually listen to.  We really enjoy it for how fun and invigorating it is to listen to
5,"my favorite songs are ""she really wants you"", ""video"", and  ""little bombs"". excellent album. her 2nd best beside bachelor no.2"
5,"This is definitely one of those albums that you can play over and over again and discover something new and brilliant each time.  The lyrics are brilliant, the melodies are beautiful and the music is simply enchanting.  Shannon McNally has really found her stride with this album.  Personal favs include ""Pale Moon"" ""The Hard Way"" and her cover of Taj's ""Lovin' In My Baby's Eyes."" "
5,"excellent recording, very destictively colored music....I was impressed and am listening to it quite frequently."
5,"Echo Echo is a marvelous fusion of alternative, punk and Irish folk music. It is by far their best album"
1,I bought one of these CD's many years ago and found out the hard way.  What a joke and a ripoff.  No original artists and nowhere on the CD does it say this.  I never bought another one. 
2,"I think they put the wrong cd in the case because most of sublimes good stuff is missing.  Weird.  Buy 40oz to freedom or anything other than this cd if you do not already have them.  It's has some good songs but false advertisement comes to mind.  Hardcore sublimers may want it, but you never really have to open it.     "
2,"When I listened to this CD I actually expected to hear Gloria Estafan singing on some of these songs.  Some of them seem like they were written for her.  Wild Card has a few good songs on it.  The title track is okay.  Moonlight and King Of Hearts are better.  The last good CD by the Rippington's was Weekend In Monaco.  Changes in personnel, locations, and labels haven't proved to be too good for Russ's music.  He's made his money and can experiment with various ideas.  Wild Card is loser in my opinion, but at least it's better than Brave New World"
5,"This is one of the greatest CDs ever recorded. Jason Robert Brown is an amazingly gifted songwriter and an incredible vocalist. Not to mention he must have made some pact with Satan or something to be able to play the piano like that.   This CD has music that is catchy, thoughtful, sincere, and beautiful.   An amazine CD."
2,"I'm a huge u2 fan but maybe I'm the only one on this world who doesn't like r.e.m. very much.I find songs like drive,everybody hurts and man on the moon(one of my favourite)very beautiful.But the other songs are boring and ripetitive.I don't know why people say that this is one of the best album in music.I hope one day I'll understand this band.."
2,"then just pick up Appetite For Destruction  AFD was one of the greatest rock albums ever made.  I wanted to hate the album so much.  I was an alternative/avant guard snob when AFD was released.  To me, these clowns were just another hairspray band. But I took a long car trip with some chick I was banging and her roommate. The roommate played the tape at least three times on the trip.  By the end, I was hooked.  That's the mark of truly great art.  If it can draw in someone who's predisposed to hate it, its got something special.  I looked forward to the next album, G N' R Lies.  But when it came out, I was disappointed.  It was ok, but hardly the cultural epoch that was AFD.  Nice Boys was kind of fun. Used to Love Her was a humorous novelty song. Mama Kin was a decent cover, but no real improvement over the original.  The rest of the disk was just crap.  But what the hell, its was just an EP right? Something to tide us over until the next brutal masterpiece.  Then came GnR's death knell, the two Use Your Illusions.  Over-produced, bloated, boring and pretentious.  Everything I had always hated Hair-Metal for in the first place.  Gone was the sound of the alley ways of Sunset Boulevard, replaced by the sound of computers, maids and Beverley Hills hookers n blow parties.  Rock n Roll sung by a guy in custom-ripped jeans who just came out of a session with his hair stylist and manicurist.  Nothing to see here.  Move along.  So, if you want to see the genius and promise of GnR, just pick up Appetite For Destruction, and pretend they just broke up after creating one of the greatest albums of all time"
5,"An unfortunate trend amongst young male country singers from the early 1990s was to produce an outstanding, real country first album before veering down the path of increasingly pop-driven music. This was never more true than in the case of John Michael Montgomery, whose 1992 debut CD Life's A Dance is an undoubted 5 star release. Full of great stone country (Beer And Bones, Life's A Dance, Nickels And Dimes And Love - originally recorded by Charley Pride - and Dream On Texas Ladies), Montgomery's infectious vocal twang saw him immediately rack up the first of several country number ones. The album's biggest hit was the quality ballad, I Love The Way You Love Me. Unfortunately, as early as his second album Kickin' It Up (the title suggests more excitement than the album delivered), Montgomery's song selections became more MOR and less traditional country. His greatest hits CD is worth a listen, but if you want one JMM album in your collection, it has to be this, his first"
1,"I made it half way through before piercing my eardrums with sharpened pencils.  If you can buy the karaoke version, this might be pretty good, otherwise you will get more artistry from the latest Yanni cd.  The vocals are so twee even a kindergartner would blush in shame"
1,"There is a hint that Jessica has a good voice, but apparently she is not sure where she belongs.  Some of the songs have a southern Gospel feel, and I must confess, that personally, I do not like that wailing type of music.  But, if you do, you will like SOME of the tracks.  However, on other tracks, she uses this breathy quality, that I suppose, is trying to imitate a sexy nightclub singer.  These two styles do not work well together.  Except for die-hard Jessica fans, this is not a particularly good album.  It is ho-hum pop and even less attractive as Christmas music.  At times I am reminded of Marilyn Monroe singing ""Happy Birthday, Mr. President.""  The problem is that Marilyn was NOT known as a singer.  Jessica needs to rethink her presentation.  Only buy this album if you think Jessica is the greatest thing since Edison invented the light bulb."
1,"I READ ALL THE REVIEWS ABOUT THIS BOXED SET AND NOBODY EVER SAID THAT THE DVD IS SO DARK THAT MOST OF THE TIME YOU SEE A OUTLINE OF BRUCE ONLY. I DON'T CARE IF THIS IS A PIECE OF HISTORY, IF YOU CAN'T SEE THE MAIN PERFORMER THEN WHY WASTE THE SPACE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THE ONLY PERSON THAT YOU CAN SEE GOOD IS THE SAX PLAYER BECAUSE HE'S WEARING A WHITE SUIT AND ONCE IN A WHILE THEY PUT A WHITE SPOT ON HIM. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY THE OTHER DVD'S....................."
5,"I feel like such a fool!  This album is 6 years old and I heard it for the first time a few weeks ago.  What's more, I've since asked several of my friends who also love neo-soul music if they've heard it, and may of them didn't even know WHO I was talking about.  That is a crime, because this album is fantastic.  Fantastic, I say.  It's one of those albums where I did not have to look at the album credits to see who wrote and produced the songs.  It's obvious from how his voice perfectly compliments the music that his is not simply the voice chosen to sing these songs that someone else wrote.  This is what I appreciate most about the Neo-soul genre; the tendency for the artists who perform the music to be more than just singers.  They are musicians.  (This is what is so frustrating about Brian McKnight, incidentally.  He is a musician, but still refuses to sing in his vocal range.  Many of the songs that he has written for himself are too high for him!  That just shouldn't be)  In any case, go get this album if you like good music"
4,"When Green Day changed up their sound around the mid-90's and came through with a more slickly produced, commercial sound, a lot of their loyal fans didn't like it. But what they seemingly forgot to look at amidst their curious anger is that Green Day's new stuff sounded really good ('Warning' especially), even though, yeah, it sounded quite a bit different.  When it comes to Bob Dylan, die-hard fans compare an album like Empire Burlesque  (and probably a couple before it) with the likes of Highway 61 Revisited and Bringing It All Back Home, and a lot of them not only don't like the change but are agitated with their sneaky hero, though his status as 'constantly-looked-up-to'  remains in tact.  Granted, as much as I like Empire Burlesque, it has to be careful with itself because as it goes from one song to the next you almost feel like you're going to hear this as a soundtrack for a really syrupy Cameron Crowe movie, and that's no good.  But Dylan's sensibilty doesn't go quite that far down the wimpy direction as he remains hard-hearted and overly introspective, even if fairly non-sensical at times.  I love songs like 'Tight Connection to My Heart'   'I'll Remember You'    'Emotionally Yours'   and 'Never Gonna Be The Same Again.' Though the disk sounds slicker than usual, it's a mistake to think the authenticity level dropped at all. If anything, he seems to be connecting with these songs at a higher degree than what is usual with him.  Another great thing about this album is that it's pretty consistent. A couple of the tunes are slighter but none of them are bad and they're all at least a litte above mediocre, with a high portion of it ranging from good to excellent. And that's saying a lot for someone like Dylan, who is so terribly inconsistent. Not long ago I listend to Planet Waves and there are 2-3 outrageously listenable songs there but so much of it is so mediocre.   I've always thought Dylan likes being disliked and that's why he puts out such terrible songs intermingled with all the stuff that's good.  He doesn't want people coming too close and that desire of his seems to draw his fans near all the more.  I saw Dylan in concert last year and he was on keyboards due to some kind of arthritis, or something. There was a guitar planted on the center of the stage and after every song Dylan walked over, with his back hunched over and his shoulders sulking, his white warm-up suit and cowboy hat making him look like a modern-day Texas circus hand. Once there he would walk around the vicinity of the guitar and oftentimes the crowd's screaming would peak, but every time Dylan did not pick up the guitar and instead slowly meandered over to his keyboards. Not once did he pick up the guitar that night but he led the audience to believe he would about 15-20 times. What a tease.   On Empire Burlesque he seems to have softened up and not minded creating something nice all the way through. And those strange actions of his which somehow draw his worshipers ever nigher are absent here, and I'm thankful for that"
1,"Ok lets get right to the point veary chingon movie, lots of action good gangster s*** but this!!! I mean wheres the firme musica??? You would think with such a great movie the soundtrack to the movie would be so bueno but it just doesent grab my attention at all. I mean some of the songs are good like the one bye Funkadoobiest and Girls It Aint Easy bye the 4 Corners and the one bye Boss Catch Hit and Run but on these songs they are a different version of the songs not the ones like the way they were in the movie and they left some good songs out for instence, the one So Ruff so Tuff by Zapp and Roger great song!!! but not on there. Well I have them already it's just the point that they left some stuff out. Well... just understand me, in what i'm saying and get somthing else like the Bound By Honor soundtrack. Now thats a good one!!! as for the 1 in rating well you figure it out"
2,"Harry Connick, Jr. did a fair job representing the musical legends that were found in the movie, but nonetheless, this soundtrack should contain the artists who created the songs and/or who were featured in the motion picture. If you are purchasing this CD because you enjoy the classics performed by musical legends, as I do, then I do not recommend this CD; instead I would buy the originals"
2,This CD is NOT the music soundtrack from the movie.  It's only some of the music that is in the movie.  I was very disappointed.  I wanted the original soundtrack of the music you hear when you watch the movie.  That's why I purchased it.  Is the original soundtrack NOT available or was it not produced?  I wouldn't buy this CD again.
2,"I am pro-Neal Schon.  I own many of his solo efforts and every Journey album to date.  However, I honestly can't understand why everyone is rating this album with 5 stars.  It simply does not meet the mark on this one.    None of the tracks have a theme that will 'grab' you.  These aren't songs that will stick in your head.  Saying that this album is 'Neal exploring his melodic side' is pretty inaccurate.  If want to hear Neal's 'melodic side,' by ""Beyond the Thunder...."" one of his best to date.  These tracks are him basically exploring his improvisational side and jamming to a drum machine.  Even live drum tracks by a great drummer such as Omar Hakim sound as if they are programmed.  I was disappointed on this one.  Neal is an exceptional guitarist....one of the best in the world.  He just didn't hit the mark on this one. "
2,"It's more grown up than her previous albums in bad way.  I can't play a few of the songs with my kids around.  While the inappropriate songs may be catchy, it's disappointing that they had to be so ""give it to me"".  It's also missing the ""rap/yodeling/soul"" stuff that made me like her so much in the first album"
5,"I heard ""Dirty Harry"" on Upop XM and began thinking about taking a chance on buying the album.  Then my wife came home one day and said she heard a song on a local station and really liked it-but she didn't know the title or artist.  The station helped when she emailed them and it turned out to be ""Feel Good Inc"" from the same album!  The choice was now clear!  Log on the Amazon! A first listen to the whole album was good, but not as good as I had anticipated. The second, third, and fourth listen hooked me good!  I even like the 2 cuts I first thought were terrible.  Now I will be getting a second album so I don't have to share"
5,"Every track on da CD is hott. Itz a good CD to ride to at night & make love to.  The girlz can sing their ass off. I really didnt know anything about these girls until 1 of my girls put me on to them & i have had their CD play-n ever since.  Like i said all the trackz are hott but my personal favorites are Get up on It, Surrender,& Keep On. If you are think-n about get-n it-get it...you'll love it & if u dont something wrong wit your earz. Not like-n this is like say-n 12 Play is wack & u know everybody love 12 PLa"
4,"Loved the movie and the music.  The soundtrack is good, but I was very disappointed not to have Usher's ""Yeah"" on the soundtrack - the dancing scene is one of the best parts of the movie for goodness' sake!  Oh well, still a good CD"
5,"Just in time for their induction into the Rock N' Roll Hall Of Fame comes this new Blondie collection that showcases some of the band's most popular, influential songs, material from their recent releases and a mash-up with one of the bands that influenced them. ""Sound & Vision,"" like most Best Of sets is both a good introduction to the band's music and a well-assembled collection for the casual listener who likes Blondie, but enough to purchase every album. There is no doubt that Debbie Harry and the gang not only produced good music, but were one of the main reasons why we have real chick rockers like Shirley Manson, Gwen Stefani and yes, Madonna. Befire Princess Diana ever graced magazine covers, Harry was the most photographed woman in the world but a real Punk at heart, posing at times with such figures as Joey Ramone and Iggy Pop (eventhough at one point Patti Smith told her to ""get the f--k out of rock n' roll""). ""Sound And Vision"" nicely shows what all the fuss was about in the late 70's through mid-80's. A lot of the songs have survived the test of time with a real sense of fun and energy like ""Call Me"" with it's roaring chorus and electro sheen while ""Heart Of Glass"" is still a classic jam, disco has died and yet this song remains. ""Rapture"" is still a long, dreamy anthem that brought hip-hop to a wider audience before Aerosmith and Run DMC ever broke the barrier of rock and rap. Newer material is also present here, ""Maria"" was a single off the band's 1999 album ""No Exit,"" but it still has that classic Blondie sound. However I do believe listeners are cheated here when it comes to the song ""Good Boys"" off their latest release, ""The Curse Of Blondie."" The original version is a great song, but the remix here makes the song kind of cold and hollow, the same for the ""In The Flesh"" remix which rips the song apart, turning it into cold, techno sludge. Luckily there is one worthy remix present, ""Rapture Riders,"" which brilliantly meshes ""Rapture"" with The Doors' ""Riders On The Storm."" Both songs flow perfectly together and it's a fitting combination since Blondie have always named The Doors as a prime influence and favorite band. Too bad Jim Morrison died in 1972, you get the feeling he and Harry would have done a marvelous duet. The extra DVD that comes with the set is a must for Blondie fans, many of the band's videos are included for classics like ""Heart Of Glass,"" ""The Tide Is High"" and even the recent videos for ""Maria"" and ""Good Boys."" ""Sight In Sound"" a fun ride through the Blondie catalogue and a must for collectors of classic rock anthologies, and a neat teaching tool for those who wanna know why girls like Gwen, Shirley and even Britney have been scandalous and glamorous and know how to pull it off and who they learned it from"
2,"Wow, I sampled the songs on this new CD and I really am surprised at the drop in quality and uniqueness Sting used to bring to the music.  Like DeNiro and Pacino.  Where are they now?  Doing comedy and bland movies.  Not like the movies of yester-year when they were top notch.  Stings voice is still among the best in the world, just the music behind him is what makes his CDs bland and uninteresting.  I mean, Techno and Rap.  It's like a mundane chant, much like the Sting of the past used to sing out about.  It looks like the music industry of today is not only responsible for some of the most uninteresting music and groups it's also consuming those that used to be the best.  It's really a shame to see an artist like Sting decline in his work.  Brand New Day was the start.  Although it wasn't all bad, but you got the sense that he was lost or beginning to lose his way and his style.  Oh, well, albums like ""Ten Summoner's Tale"", ""Nothing Like the Sun"", ""Soul Cages"", and ""Dream of the Blue Turtles"" were the best of his solo career.  Now, he's just earning a paycheck.  Farewell Sting.  It was nice knowing you"
2,IF YOUR A GARY ALLAN FAN I UNDERSTAND WHY.GARY'S VOICE IS GREAT BUT THE SONGS HE SINGS USUALLY [ARE WEAK].OF ALL HIS ALBUMS THIS IS THE WORST...
4,"Check out Augustana, without doubt last year's most promising new band, completely despite the fact that its own record label -- that'd be Epic, which has been in a tailspin since Polly Anthony left -- seems to have no clue whatever that they exist.  Their debut album, the extraordinary All the Stars and Boulevards, was tossed thoughtlessly into the marketplace a year ago and, minus even a modicum of press or publicity, got promptly crushed in the avalanche of fourth-quarter releases; its soaring title track -- one of `05's most potent -- was so thoroughly shunned by radio that it had to be a conspiracy.  So how's this for a dark horse story?  Practically as an afterthought as spring closed, Epic chose as Boulevards' second single the wistful, resplendent ""Boston"" and then sat on their dead, numb rumps while the song -- helped along by a simple but exquisite video that opens with a close-up of the band's twenty-one-year-old (!) lead singer Dan Layus (think 3 Doors Down's Brad Arnold with a more agile voice, and much much cuter) and fades to black with a shoreline of overturned pianos destroyed by the incoming tide -- built steadily, week on week, against all conventional wisdom which states that summer, with its easy melodies and breezy sentiments, is the wrong season in which to try to launch a complex, chorus-less single whose heroine is drowning in depression and desperation, and whose back half, in lieu of a repetitive refrain, rockets to a soul-cleansing, cobwebs-clearing climax so fiercely orgasmic you need a cigarette to regain your bearings.  Now there's some genuine heat swirling around the song -- enough so that Epic re-released Boulevards last week with extra tracks, an increasingly common industry practice that continues to just rankle me, if for no other reason than I'm enough of a lunatic to plunk down money twice for the same motherflippin' record, and that's what they count on, but if it helps Augustana become the raging success they richly deserve to be, all will be forgiven."
1,I'm sick of this song!! It's overplayed...Can you people stop loving Green Day so much. They suck.
2,"oh please, however catchy the beats are do not call her music hip hop,for some one who has been listen to it for years, calling her music hip hop is an insult"
2,"AFTER LISTLENING TO THIS CD A COUPLE OF TIMES AND WATCHING DR. KNOW PLAY WITH BRANDON CRUZ I THINK THAT THIS CD IS WORTH EVERY PENNY.IF YOU CALL YOURSELF A DR. KNOW FAN AND DONT OWN THIS CD THEN YOU SHOULD SLAP YOUSELF RIGHT NOW.IT DOESNT MATTER IF ITS NOT KYLE TOUCHER ITS STILL DR. KNOW AND THEY KICK ASS AND BRANDON CRUZ IS A COOL GUY.ALSO THE METAL STUFF THAT KYLE DID KICKS ASS TOO, IF YOU ARE A FAN THEN YOU SHOULD CHECK THAT OUT TOO"
1,"It's incredible how a band with so much potential and a great debut could follow it up with such a dud. There is close to nothing capitvating or engaging on this record. The songs feel like poor B sides to the original album, and while nobody ever claimed them to be geniuses they WERE catchy, but even their keen pop sensibility is pretty much lacking here. Slightly amusing for one spin, but in the long run utterly fogettable. Not even worth your time to illegally download."
5,This is one of my most favorite CDs in the history of the universe. Great on rainy days...and sunny days...and medium days too. Its good allll the time. :)
2,"Powerful voice. Mimics the styles of a variety of classic Hispanic singers.  Incredible range of material.  But, unlike Lhasa de Sela or Astrid Hadad, she leaves me flat"
5,"I JUST GOT 1 THING 2 SAY.THIS NI**A PASTOR TROY GOT GA ON LOCK.IF U AINT FEELIN HIS MUSIC,U AINT FEELIN NOTHIN.HE GOT THA TIGHTEST BEATS,AND THA TIGHTEST LYRICS EVER"

5,"the most amazing EP you will ever come across.  so much emotion flows through this album, tears come from my cd player every time in amazement.  do yourself a favor and buy this album, you will never ever regret it. "
4,"This is a solid rock album. But it's not as good as their previous effort &quot;Spiritual Machines&quot;. The sound has more bottom to it (thanks to Bob Rock -- or no thanks?) but at the same time it isn't heavier, which is strange. At first I was very disappointed with the album (I have all their previous recordings), but it eventually grew on me. However, if this is a new direction for the band, I don't know if I like where it's going"
1,"Wow so in history class they told me because of its racist themes and such that minstrel shows are long gone but they obviously haven't heard THIS trash.    Sheesh, where do I even begin?  You thought Fiddy was bad?  How about Chingy?  Lil Jon?  Nope, they're not nearly as bad as these wastes of flesh.  These guys are a disgrace to the black race, Aaron McGruder is totally right (creator of the Boondocks) if Martin Luther King Jr. did somehow get resurrected he would definitely scoff at the state of Black America, perhaps it was a tad exaggerated but it still made an excellent point.  Afterall it was Chris rock that said, ""There are black people and there's n***ers!""  Then everyone in the audience laughed their *sses off because it's true.  Unfortunately these guys fall in the latter group.  Don't give me that rubbish on how it's just the music, no way folks, this goes far beyond the music itself.  This is a reflection of the sad state our society is in.  Ok people you want to talk about the actual MUSIC?  We shall then, but these cliched annoying 'beats'  lack so much substance that I'm just wasting text space talking about the 'music'.  The lyrics?  They bring new meaning to the word STUPID.  So there you have it, this logic pretty much applies to all their cds and anyone else like them (the aforementioned rap degenerates) they really take the cake for Retards of the Decade when we talk about ""I Love the '00s"" in 10 years.  By the way check out the Boondocks, it's a great comic-turned-cartoon, it's very fresh and unique"
2,"BEP was one of my favorite hip-hop acts of the late 90's. Their Debut album ""Behind the Front"" and even their Sophomore album ""Bridging the Gap"" continued a musical approach and ideology more akin to Tribe Called Quest, Talib Kweli, De La Soul, and the Roots than the current Gangster Rap trend.  After this however, BEP apparently figured out that they can make more money with intellectually depraved dance tracks than they can with original music. And it's a shame.  Money Business is a perfect example of an album crafted from bottom to top for pop appeal. In 2004 (with Elephunk) BEP left the Artistic music community and joined the commercial music community. It was sad to see them go"
1,The mere fact that this album is popular is enough of an argument for letting terrorists bomb this country into oblivion.  The Black Eyed Peas have re-defined what awful music can sound like.  These guys have zero talent and zero class
1,I LUV FALL OUT BOY!!!!!!!!!  AWL SONGS GET 10 OUTTA 10!!!!!!  DESERVS ALL 6 STARSS!!!
5,"I have listened to Kurt Bestor for several years.  His music is soulful, peaceful and absolute magic!  He is by far my favorite &quot;new age&quot; artist.  My favorite track, What child is this...hauntingly beautiful"
5,"So how about that? A Mahler second that actually moves! The result is one of the most exciting readings of all time. It's truly legend.  This is one of the two greatest Mahler seconds. Here Mehta, who can often be an oddly questionable interpreter, lightens the music at just the right level, making it brilliantly unique. Instead of allowing the music to sink into itself, like most imitations of Bernstein's classic reccording.  Music has to move, it has to speak, it has to breathe..  Never has Mahler been so logically accessible and tended for. The experience gained from this recording is greatly edifying, if not spiritual.  Technically however, its not perfect: one thing that makes it somewhat lacking. Sometimes the orchestra is not really synchronized. Precision is sometimes sacrificed for Mehta's ingenious creativity. However, to me these sort of flaws just make the piece more homely and natural.  The Vienna is of course fantastic in sound. Brilliant, but deep and always resonant.   This is some masterpiece material. A truly excellent CD"
5,"I recently saw this guy live even though I was only familiar with ""What If That Guy From Smashing Pumpkins Lost His Car Keys"". Unless you are easily offended, go see him live. You won't regret it, he interacts with the audience a lot. I picked up this CD at the merch table after his show. Lynch's combination of acoustic guitar and innocently wicked lyrics will leave you in pain from laughing so hard. I like the fact that this was recorded before a live audience, because it captures the experience of seeing him at a show. That's what led me to buy this instead of ""A Little Bit Special"". The audience reaction to the songs on ""Superhero"" adds so much to the album. My personal favorites are:  Dr. Stephen - I love the way you expect him to say a certain word, then he says something completely innocent instead. You have to listen to know what I'm talking about.  Superhero - This song is a good example of the audience interaction at his shows. I like the audience-chosen superheroes, but I probably can't repeat the names here.  What If That Guy From Smashing Pumpkins Lost His Car Keys - Catchy title for a catchy song. Whether you like the Smashing Pumpkins or not (I do), you will find this short song hilarious. It's a really great impression of Billy Corgan.  Mother's Day - Also very short, but such an unexpected ending.  Taxi Driver - Oh man, I almost p*ssed myself the first time I heard this song! It starts out as a folk song until you hear what the taxi driver said. Totally politically incorrect, but so funny! This is my current favorite track.  Best Friends Song - This duet with Mark Teich starts out friendly and quickly becomes a song about how the one friend wants to nail  the other friend's little sister. Another one you have to hear to appreciate.  I also like the bonus track at the end which contains ""Lullaby (live)"" and ""Special Olympics (live)"". Lullaby is great, and explains to his daughter ""why Mommy left us"". This album is a good place to start if you like dark offensive humor"
4,"That these songs are not already all over radio proves that radio is bad for music.  Good lyrics, great musicians, sincere, complex rock and roll that rarely sounds overdone.  Buy Air Stereo, then buy Bastards of the Beat, then call your local radio station and get this music out there.  I'm thinking Wild Stallions kind of world changing power here!  "
1,"WOW. 12 dollars for this CD. I must have seen this album in every stores 1 dollar bargain bin, and their wasn't one CD their was usually a big grotesque stack of them sitting thier"
5,"When I first heard the Rosabel Vocal mix at a club, I almost fainted. It was the best club remix I have ever heard.  And I was so worried a domestic single would not be released, and to my relief, it was.  Every remix on &quot;A different kind of love song&quot; is awesome.  You will also enjoy the remixes of &quot;The music is no good without you&quot;.     You will not be disappointed with this CD Single if your a cher fan and you love club remixes....!!!"
2,"Awesome album.  I bought it for ""Believe"" but there is not a bad song on the CD.  Nice suprise of the song ""Building Bridges"".  I was thinking to myself that sounds like Sheryl Crow, then looked in the liner notes and it was.  Good harmony with her and Vince Gil. "
2,"ok, I bought this cd and it gets 2 stars one each for the songs ""Believe"" and ""I'm Building Bridges"". The other songs are horrible. Ronnie is the lead vocalist for a VERY good reason! They were very smart to get Vince Gill(the best!)to do background vocals on Bridge's. Save your money or you too will be adding this one to your yard sale!"
2,"A Moose from California compared Audra's ""Bill"" with one done by Jane Monheit. I took his advise and listened to both. Audra sounds like a church choir singer making an attempt at jazz. The Moose from California has a tin ear when it comes to quality and soul.This is a sad recording as far as jazz goes. It should be in the cabaret bin. Absolutely!!"
1,"i've got the first several pearl jam album releases through 'no code'.  this band was just getting worse with every album.  eventually, i caught on and stopped wasting my $.  i read all the great reviews of this album and thought the first single was alright.  who the @$#%@ are these dumb reviewers?  are they getting paybacks?  is this politics or music?  live 105.3 barely played any of this album - and i should have taken a clue from that.  they still know how to play, but need some new energy and ideas to make cohesive, appealing songs.  also, maybe they need to be poor again to lift their spirits - obviously being filthy rich isn't helping!  only put 1 song on my mp3 players...= 1 star"
2,Too Lisa Loeb for me. Sorry. Maybe if someone else wrote her lyrics
2,I never knew a voice could sound that good but his does and I hope that he keeps up the good work.He has a strong voice and should be heard more often on radio.A friend of mine bought one of his CD at one of his concerts and it was the best I have heard in a long time.Your music sounds like it is coming from your heart.The one song that really stood out alot to me was Mama was alot like Jesus.I think that it should be your next release.It's a very touching ballad and I think people will want to hear more.A new and dedicated fan.Gerarda Watso
2,"Since ""Luck Of The Draw"" Bonnie Raitt or her record producers have been out to lunch. ""Fundamental"" sounds like a jam session gone bad. There is  really nothing special on this CD, except for ""The Spit Of Love"". When are we going to hear a song like ""When The Spell Is Broken"" again? Bonnie seems to have passed the female blues guitar mantle to Sue Foley and Kris Wiley. Sorry, I'll stick with her old albums"
4,"I enjoyed this album. At first glance it appears that it is your standard post-1990's rock album. But after a good listen, you realize that they have succeeded in forging a rather good and unique album. It's well done and has a good shelf life due to its distinctive sound"
4,"I found this Band while looking up information on Trixter and found PJ Farley in the band. Listened to RA on their website and bought this CD the same day.  I have not found a band lately that took me away like RA.    I have not heard the first album but it is next on my list, since I got Duality today and have not stopped listening to it!!!  RA ROCKS!!!"
1,"I bought CD because at the time, I was a huge Utada Hikaru fan. Her voice is shrill most of the time, but one can overlook that. However, after a time, her songs became boring. Her lyrics are boring too, and the average Jpop artist can write them. Ayumi Hamasaki is much, much, much, much better than Utada. If you want the real Jpop Queen, go for Ayu. If you want a shrill-voiced artist that's bland and boring, go for Utada"
5,"Miles always let the music do the talking, so my advice is just listen to this album. Nevertheless, I will bang on about it a bit, just like the others. This is a CD I put on after I come back from the pub, or club at night when I've had a few drinks or whatever. Somehow it just calls out to me ""Luke... Luke... PLAY ME"" and I do. It never fails to move me (and sometimes physically). It is a strange, dark brew of textured piano and electric piano riffs and some minimal rythmical work by Williams and Holland, with Miles gliding over it like only he can and John McLaughlin creating great atmosphere with some wonderful guitar work. It is raw, like most Miles Davis stuff, but also very smooth and peaceful - with a kind of dark streak running through the middle. Quite unlike any music you will hear these days, bar perhaps Aphex Twin. When I first got this album I thought it was incredible and powerful and was even quite scared of it for a while - it seemed to possess some kind of quiet voodoo power. There is magic in this music, definitely. But, over the years I have listened to it regularly and it continues to give me warm pleasures. Every listen becomes a rich, rewarding experience. It is a real grower, and calmer than most of Miles' other fusion work. It is a good companion to ""A Tribute To Jack Johnson"" (Mainly because of the presence of McLaughlin on guitar), although this album is far less aggressive, and more gentle and mysterious. The album will take you on a pleasant little journey down a bubbling creek, in the middle of the night..."
5,People snicker when I mention skee-lo b/c they don't understand what an incredible complete and great album this is.  This is one of the best albums I have ever bought
1,"Okay, two of history's most annoying hits are on this disc: Wonderwall and especially the endless, bloated Champagne Supernova. Liam Gallagher cannot sing, and these guys claiming to be better than the Beatles is ridiculous. Screw Oasis, buy Beatles"
1,"Like other uses have pointed out, the music are NOT conducted by John Williams nor performed by the London Symphony Orchestra, and they do NOT sound the same with the music from the movies.  You are still getting a nice collection of music, but for the REAL John Willims music, you gotta buy the original soundtracks.  These products just don't measure up to the authenticity of the glorious works by John Williams"
5,"This is one of my favorite Zeppelin Lps.  Musically, it's very strong.  You just have to respect a group of musicians who could have had a nice payday by turning out a clone of Led Zeppelin II, but opted to do something very different.    It's no surprise that critics and some fans didn't like this one, because the band refused to play to type.  But this is really a very strong session and shows the incredible extent of this band's ability to play a lot of different types of music.  There is a lot of acoustic work on this CD but a fair share of electric to please the electric crowd.  I purchased this in Lp format, complete with the cardboard ""wheel"" that turned inside the gatefold where you could match up pictures with holes in the outer jacket.   Anyone who listens to FM radio knows The Immigrant Song - what a great rocker.  They opened with this when I saw them in March 1969... or was it 1970... on the tour supporting Led Zeppelin II.  Friends has nice ""happy"" lyric but there's a sinister sounding string backing behind the acoustic guitar and conga drums.  Unusual.  Celebration Day is a typical Zeppelin rocker that has a great,frantic slide guitar introduction.  Since I've Been Loving You is one of the more powerful blues performances  - black or white - that I have ever heard and I've been listening seriously to music for about 37 years.  This track alone is well worth the price of the CD.  Stunning.  Out on the Tiles is another rocker.  Gallows Pole is a fabulous bit of work on a traditional English folk song done with acoustic including banjo and violin. I love Bonham's drumming on this track, it provides a lot of motion and propels the piece beautifully at just the right point in the song.  Tangerine is an acoustic love ballad - single material.  It's a nice little composition.  That's the Way is a sad little acoustic song about not being allowed to play with the boy next door (I think... it also seems to have an ecological message and a recognition that all that lives is born to die) - I love this tune.  Bron Y Aur - more English folk music, a happy jig of sorts about growing old with the woman you love.  Hat's Off To Harper  - contrary to a prior reviewer, this is a great blues piece done with slide on acoustic as an homage to Page's buddy Roy Harper (See Stormcock on AMazon.com)  I love the tremelo effect they put on Plants vocal.  This lyric eventually became Custard Pie on Physical Graffiti.  Page will be appearing with Harper at a show this summer (2006) playing the entire Stormcock release.  It's a bit pricey because it's an import but if you can afford it it's available here on Amazon.com.  Page is a cameo guest on Stormcock.  Knowelegeable folks know that Roy Harper sang Have A Cigar on Pink Floyd's Wish You were here.  This man has trememdous respect from musicians in Britain including McCartney, Kate Bush, Page, Dave Gilmore and others.  He's a living legend in Britain for people ""in the know"".  All of the tracks are good, Since I've Been Loving You and Gallows Pole are definitely my favorites.  Buy this at once! "
5,"One of the early Judas Priest albums, here we find Rob Halford's voice slightly different (something that would be complained about 20 years later with the release of an album with the band Two) and starting to change into the voice we hear on albums like ""British Steel"" and ""Screaming for Vengeance."" All of Glenn Tipton's and KK Downing's signature guitar licks are on here. All the songs are good (there's even a Priest classic...""Beyond the Realms of Death"") but this album is far from being their best album or even in the same league as albums like ""Hellbent for Leather"" or ""British Steel"". But, don't get me wrong. It's good for an earlier release, but other than that...Get one of their later albums first.  1. Exciter-5/5-Good drum intro. The song is catchy for the most part and Rob Halford does some great screetching in this song. 2. White Heat, Red Hot-4/5-This song's OK, but I think the part where Halford says ""white heat, red hot."" is annoying. 3. Better By You Better than Me-3/5-His voice sounds more like it did on later albums, but this song doesn't seem really inspired. 4. Stained Class-5/5-Great song! The music on this track in particular rocks. 5. Invader-5/5-This song took a while to grow on me, but it's a very cool song. 6. Saints in Hell-5/5-I like the title and the lyrics. The song has some great sounds. 7. Savage-5/5-This song is really great, Halford's screeching can't be topped on this song. 8. Beyond the Realms of Death-5/5-Probably the best song on here. 9. Heroes End-5/5-Lyrics are good (For a hard rock song).  A"
1,"A rewiver In a big music magazine wrote that this record reminded him of Bottle Rockets and The Drive-By Truckers. He must be kiddin`. You can't compare apples with oranges. I rather say It sounds like Bon Jovi were playin somekind of Nashville pop-country, like the Great Divide.  Some compare this to legends like Lynyrd Skynyrd and Allman Bros. They couldnt have been listening to the same record as me!  But If you like Shelby Lynne and Pat Greens newer stuff, lend an ear to these guys. But If you want blood, search the real thing In these bands The Lost Trailers thinks they have something In common with."
2,"Your Love by Laura Branigan is the reason that I bought this CD.  It is the only reason that I've kept it all of these years.  Her immense vocals can knock down walls at one second and caress your heart the next.  One of the, if not the most overlooked vocalists ever.  Spanish Harlem by Ben E. King, of course, is another great song but you don't need to by this soundtrack for it.  The rest of the CD is throw away.  But for the Laura Branigan song alone it's worth the money.  It's the only reason I gave this album two stars!  If Atlantic Records ever releases a box set for her, or remasters her albums with this song on either, this CD will be turned in to a used CD store &quot;Pronto!&quot;"
2,"George Benson is one the greatest guitarist of all time.  I bought this CD with the hope of hearing George Benson play the guitar with the skill and passion that most professional performers could only dream about.  George Benson did come through on two of the three purely instrumental tracks, ""Softly, As In a Mountain Sunrise"" and ""Arizona Sunrise.""  These are the only two tracks produce by Paul Brown.  The other instrumental, ""Take You Out"" is a tribute to Luther Vandross and is on the ""Forever, For Always, For Luther"" CD.  George Benson does showcase some of his talent, but he kept the song true to Luthers' rendition ""Take You Out.""  The bottom line is: if you think George Benson is a great vocalist, you will love this CD, and in my opinion, he is just tolerable.  Three instrumental tracks, seven vocal tracks, this CD is not ""Irreplaceable."" "
5,"This is perhaps, Najee's finest CD. It has real, qualitative jazz flavorings. This is what ""smooth jazz"" is all about. The entire CD is worth the price and then some. This CD is definetly worth five stars"
5,"I could say alot about this but I will only say a little because I don't need to waste time writing how I feel about this CD nor do you need waste time reading what anybody wrote! Get this CD it is to me one the most slept on album in years but don't you sleep on it, cop this joint!!! peace"
1,COMPETED SO MUCH WITH THE SPOKEN WORD.  I wouldn't be able to reccomend this for bed time at all as you have to listen SO hard to hear the words that it becomes very &quot;unrelaxing&quot;.  However if you chose to  listen to this during the day this would probably work for you
1,"Amazon's editorial review declares that it's pointless to argue the appropriateness of harpsichord music on modern piano. Okay... De gustibus non disputandum. Rather than argue, may I suggest that you listen to the same music as played by Trevor Pinnock on harpsichord. Even more aptly, you might listen to Gould's Goldberg Variations in comparison to Pinnock or Bob van Asperen on harpsichord. And if it turns out that you enjoy both, then you are a lucky listener"
2,"I was expecting (er, hoping for) something closer to ""Hounds of Love,"" but this was spacey and unspooled. I appreciate change and I appreciate disjointed ethereal songwriting, but this was a bit much for me. Some songs seem to just spin off into nothingness, others drag on and on. A few songs have much triter lyrics than I expected from her, and on most her voice seems to be rambling while disregarding the music behind it. I liked one or two tracks, but overall I cannot get into this"
4,"Jack White has done it again!  This is my second White Stripes CD (first being Elephant) and it does not disappoint.  Jack White still has that raw sound with shredding guitar and screeching vocals.  This album seems more mature in a way but at the same time, you know it's the White Stripes from the opening riff and when Jack's vocals come in.  Red Rain, White Moon, and Blue Orchid shows that Jack White loves to put color in the titles as well as in his songs as there are a few different styles.  My favorites, though, are Blue Orchid, My Doorbell, and I'm Lonely (But I Ain't That Lonely Yet).  I think I still like Elephant better but one thing is for certain - the White Stripes aren't fading away anytime soon.  I love his Led Zeppelin/Nirvana style voice and can't wait to hear his new band, The Raconteurs"
1,"Garbage! Pure garbage! Sh**! Pure sh**! The only reason she got any type of record deal is because of her looks. She cannot sing whatsoever, and her voice is terrible, and she has no place in the music industry. If you have not noticed, all her hits (only 3 of them) are all collaborations, which says a lot because she can't even sell on her own and stand on her own feet. The only good song on here is ""It's all about me"" with Sisqo. Seriously, don't waste your time or your money on this talentless slut! Grade: "
5,"I saw her in concert and the next night I drove to another state to see her again. Wow, she does sound better than her recordings. Her voice is so sweet it brought tears to my eyes. Genre? I love jazz, folk, blues... Hey, its roots. She's beautifully and purely Lizz. I can't wait till she gets back to the states. You can't hold a moon beam in your hand"
1,"Whats the song called and who is it sung by when Brian pulls up to the cafe where mia works, its like a little italian/ spanish love song, plz plz tell me i love it an cant find it"
5,"Recently I undertook the challenge of burning a ""Best Of 2005"" Smoothjazz CD.  The challenge was daunting, being limited to approximately 15 tracks.    Four tracks came from this wonderful CD.  Gregg Karukas, always a skilled keyboardist, has outdone himself with these wonderful tracks.  Track 1, ""Girl In The Red Dress"" is a fun, upbeat way of beginning this musical adventure.  Track 5, ""First Flight Home"" is an immensly sexy and driven song.  Track 7, ""Corner Club"" is a combination of absolutely haunting to so much fun.  And then there's track 8, ""Isabella"".  In my opinion the best single Smoothjazz track of 2005.  It is the kind of track, when a friend asks ""what exactly is smoothjazz?""  Play ""Isabella"" for them.  They'll understand.  Buy this CD, you'll love playing it for years to come and the artists deserve your support for putting out music at this quality level."
5,"As a newcomer to My Chemical Romance, I've been completely blown away by this CD.  That's the good news.  The bad news is that now I have to get all of their previous CDs because they're just too good.  There were quite a few CDs from my favorite bands that I was anticipating this fall, most of which were a total disappointment.  Thanks MCR, for giving us a worthy CD to listen to.  Flashes of Queen, The Killers (Hot Fuss-not the new horrible CD), Jimmy Eat World, even Rocky Horror Picture Show--I could totally envision a broadway show or movie for the theatrical quality of some songs.  Can't recommend it highly enough"
5,"Martina McBride delivers a Traditional Country Music Vocal Performance on her latest CD Martina McBride ""Timeless.""  Martina McBride covers Lynn Anderson song ""(I Never Promised You A) Rose Garden"" on her latest CD Martina McBride ""Timeless."" Martina McBride is a Country music pioneer in her own class"
1,"I bought this album thinking that it would be good...boy was I wrong! Ms. McBride did not do these songs justice by the way she sang them. Rose Garden, for example is my favorite song, and is sung by Lynn Anderson...it was the most beautiful song ever and you could almost feel the Rose Garden as Lynn was singing. Marting sang the song like it was a meaningless song...no feeling, emotions, etc. The rest of the songs sounded crummy too. Save your money and buy the orginal artist who sang the songs."
1,"This is not the music from the movie. This purchase was a Major dissapointment. You would do beter searching for the music credits for titles, then download the tracks form your music subscriber"
5,"Joshs song ""To Where You Are"" was written for his grama after her death. I just lost my grama and this was the song that was sung at the chaple.  It is a beautiful song that shows the love for a family member, I'm buying the CD, so that my grama will always be close to me      "
4,"Judging by their latest release ""A Murder of Crows"", Incubus have ditched their funk/Nu-Metal/Progressive/Poppish style for a more straight forward rock sound. And for good reason. The moniker genre they were usually placed under has long since died out, and the remaining bands that attempt to release material even remotely close to Nu-Metal usually replicate the Nu-metal bands that came before them. Lets face it, Nu-Metal is dead, and it never really was that great to begin with. Incubus was one of the few great bands that incorporated Hip Hop/Funk/Metal/Jazz and a DJ all in one package. ""Morning View"" sees the band in their most popular and at the height of their career. Now in the lime light, with millions of fans, ""Morningview"" does show the band ditching much of their Hip-Hop/Funky roots for more mature production and compostition. The vocals have become the lead instrument with the band taking much of a back seat. That is not to say that ""Morninview"" is a less-than-stellar album, on the contrary, it is an album worth owning with much to offer. The musicianship is still amazing and the vocals and lyrics are just as deep and meaningful. ""Morninview"" takes time to break into, and even more time to find the hidden gems beyond just being a ""great"" radio friendly album. Just like ""Make Yourself"" I took this album at face value and have missed much of the magic to be found in each song. Under a new light one can easily see that ""Morninview"" is one of the greatest releases of its time"
2,"After reading other reviews, I expected something a little more. Other than Gimme Little Sign, the first listen did not impress. Maybe it will grow on me. If not, my Daughter may like it"
1,"After months of searching, I found the out of print cd here.  I had never heard it, but after hearing the fabulous song &quot;My Only&quot; from the &quot;Good as it gets&quot;  movie soundtrack, I had to hear the album.  What a disappointment!  Oh well, it would have been hard to make a cd as good as that song"
1,"Steve Albini has got to be the most sanctimonious, self-possessed, pompous [person] in the entire music industry. He emerges in one hysterically pretentious band after another. He's hailed as some sort of guru by ""alternative"" people, when he's actually nothing but an uninformed, homophobic piece of ****. In the song ""Jordan, Minnesota"" he slanders innocent parents for molesting their children even though the true story is all over the net. Ever heard of research, Steve? Guess not, you've probably been too busy sleeping with prostitutes and pissing on other bands equipment (yeah, I read the tour diary). As for the ""music"", this is a record by and for people who hate music"
5,"This CD is so great.  There is such a good variety of songs on here that you will be happy with listening to it over and over again.  ""Save a horse, ride a cowboy"" is an upbeat, witty song that will make you want to get up on the table and let loose!  Well worth your money"
1,"This album sucks. The song are soooooooo boring. it's just like listening to cold play but even cold play being on drugs, because sometimes people don't do things as well when they're drunk or on drugs. So, if cold play was on drugs they would not play good music and they already suck and levy is like way worse than cold play so what that does that say about their music. It's just so bad. the guitar player needs to take more lessons, maybe from the lead guitar player from new found glory becuase he rocks. ok that's all.  Jason Mitchel"
5,"Bun B put together a great album. His flow and lyrics are always on point and he works well with the majority of his guest appearances. If anyone has something bad to say about Bun B or Pimp C or UGK, you don't know real southern rap. The only thing that will become better than this is when Bun B and Pimp C release that new UGK album!

1,"This is a terrible album.  Cocorosie is one of those bands that are fun to throw in with a bunch of other bands in a music related conversation to make your taste and knowledge of hip and independent music sound that much bigger than it really is.  The cover artwork is pretty funny and cocorosie is a cool name, the only problem is that they make music that sounds like it does and they charge people money to listen to it. "
5,"Some terrific songs are included, but there are many missing---   especially ""The Continental"" which was in the movie.  I can't finding the complete song anywhere. Why did they omit it on the CD? "
1,"This cd sucks! Nobody can sing! Andrea McCardle is a horrible annie. Reid Shelton is the worst Daddy Warbucks Ever. Bert Healy sucks too. I Hate This Cd. Please Don't buy this, I'ts Horrible! It's A Humiliation To The Musical Annie! I'm 16, and I Grew Up with Aileen Quinn as Annie. Alicia Morton is The Best Annie. If you want a good Annie Cd, Buy The Television soundtrack to Annie. Everybody on this cd Sucks"
5,"Wow, what an inspiring book.  It was recommended to me by a South African, whose ethnic background is Caucasian, that to learn about South Africa's recent history and culture, one should read this book.  This book is truly amazing and very, very informative.  The civil rights struggle for equality and equal treatment is vividly depicted.  The decades spent to peacefully open the government policies so that the citizens of the country can equally share the benefits and contribute to the improvement of their society is remarkable.  One important point is that many individuals did not share their government's oppressive policies and many, regardless of ethnic background, supported Mr. Mandela.  His ability to unite a divided country is truly inspiring.  If one wants to learn how difficult it is to live as a second class citizen, with very restrictive policies in a police state, this book is it.  We in the US are very fortunate to have many freedoms and opportunities that we often take for granted.  After reading this book, I am very thankful that we are a united country where we promote based on a person's ability to perform, not their ethnic or religious background.   Reading Colin Powell's autobiography ""My American Journey"" one also gets a good view on how we in the US can achieve based on our own accomplishments once given a open, honest, and fair opportunity to perform our job."
1,"Those Franchise Boys (name edited for proper grammar reasons) are just another reason why rap is basically nothing more but flogging a dead horse nowadays. This is simply nothing but mindless drivel. It's basically a scam for more cash, like the majority of rap nowadays. This has no value, no meaning, nothing. Just a bunch of n*gg*rs rapping about the most ridiculous stuff to date.   Buy anything except for this"
1,"Shevonne the imperial hoodrat or whatever you claim to be.....you wouldn't know about being a hustler if Ice-T slapped you with your tampon. Its painfully obvious that you don't have any music knowledge due to the fact you enjoy ignorant, inbred, klown music. I am sure you do relate to the lyrics because you definitely have the iq of a tree frog. And no I will never reach that level.......or should I say sink to that level because I never move backwards with my intellect only forward.   Dem Wack boyz are one of th worst groups out there to date.  Support real emcees like Mos Def, KRS-One, and Immortal Technique"
5,"I'm astounded at the number of people that think that an upbeat lovesong like this is supposed to be sung with a voice that conveys angst.  Gritty is putting it mildly, the album version of this song sounds like Chad Kroeger has bronchitis.. curiously enough it sounds very similar to an audio file that's been run through a heavy sound compression codec, which is to say distorted and overall harsh.  I'm certain that this is the version that Santana would have wanted on the album, but Alex Band of the Calling just isn't as big a name as Chad Kroeger of Nickleback, they needed big names to sell it.  So they recorded this altogether better version to play on the radio and in the video to make people think that's what they were getting on the full CD, then pulled a fast one and delivered the bronchitis special edition instead.  On the other hand as the other reviews have suggested, if you liked the album version, if you honestly believe that a love song is supposed to be sung with angst.. and.. er.. grit..  then the CD single is probably not for you"
5,This cd is by far my most FAVORITE Kenny Chesney CD of all time! I love each and every song on it. Even the bonus tracks are fantastic! A must have for the country music fan!!!!
5,"Madman Across The Water.  Wow! This is an essential Elton John album.    By now, most are familiar with the opening track, Tiny Dancer.  Beautiful piano and a melodic falseto set the tone for this, my favorite Elton John tune (and I have many!).  Levon and the title track are also two huge standouts of this album.  This is less a collection of singles with filler as E.J. has been accused of creating later in his career.  Taken as a whole, this album is simply a masterpiece.   Madman was created before the flashy Goodbye Yellow Brick Road days, with all the pomp and ceremony that came along with it.  Here's you get the feeling of a new artist, hungry and clawing to get to the top of the pack.  He's succeeded with this effort and hasn't looked back since.  If you're a partial E.J. fan and are looking for some of his slightly more obscure work, Madman Across The Water would be a perfect and thoroughly enjoyable choice"
4,If you love Mozart you will really enjoy this CD. In my opinion Sir Neville Marriner & the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields  performs Mozart better than any other. The only problem I have with this CD is some tracks on the first CD are recorded live. I have never been a big fan of live recordings. An occasional cough is heard on track 4 which makes me cringe. If only they passed out cough drops that evening I would have awarded this CD five stars. Otherwise the music is simply sublime. Robitussin anyone
2,"The reason I can never fully like this album is because of what it created in it's wake, the ""float on"" kids. I've been listening to modest mouse since when they began and I am disappointed going to a show and having a thousand kids scream at the top of their lungs for that song. If you listen to any of their other stuff, you will realize that it sounds nothing like original modest and they have made their first ""mass produced"" superhit. The album has it's moments with ""blame it on the tetons"" and ""the world at large"" but ""dance hall"" and ""satin in a coffin"" bring it down. If you enjoyed listening to modest mouse before this cd came out, don't buy it. You will be disappointed"
4,"Ciara does not have a pretty voice. Her single ""Goodies"" mislead everyone to think the CD was bumping, but that show in the hell was not true. This album has about 10 or 11 songs that are actually good. The following songs include... Goodies, Hotline, Oh , Lookin' At U, Ooh Baby, Next To You, And I, Other Chicks and The Title.I gave this album 4 stars and it show in the hell don't deserve it. Can I Get A Witness!Has anyone besides me notice that Ciara can't dance and sing. Everytime she perform this hoochie can't hardly breath. i guess they call that ASTHMA! Ciara do me a favor. Next time you bring out a CD, you need to breath, stretch, shake and let it go."
1,"Anyone looking for the song ""You're Just What I Need"" featured in this movie can find the song on the CD ""More Than A Lot"" by Rufus King.  It's a very hard-to-find CD because the band didn't have a label but I found it on cdbaby.com.  Don't know if it's still for sale there or not but the CD is worth it"
5,"Art of Chill 2 is an amazing divergence from traditional relaxation CD's.  Whether I'm looking for background sounds while reading, entering the relaxation zone or focusing on positive feelings, this 2 CD collection has become a favorite of mine.  I'm a musician and have not been a big fan of electronically created drum or melodic sounds, but when I heard this CD I was attracted to all of the tracks immediately.  It's not too often that you can find an artist/CD where everthing on it has an impact on you.  While playing the CD's working in my office I'm able to focus my concentration and satisfy my never ending craving for new and creative sounds.  If I want to relax and calm myself I've been able to do so with the sounds on this CD set.  Jon Hopkins is a clever musician and taps into some captivating rythyms, chord progressions, melodies and lyrics.  I enjoy listening to this CD as it is my number one relaxation technique on plastic.  Very captivating, and you'll definetly chill; don't pass it up."
1,"Anyone who buys this CD thinking it has something to do with harp music is going to be very disappointed. There's nothing of the tranquility and serenity of the harmonious harp here. What you get is rather percussive and at times repetitive pianoplaying, seemingly based on random chords. The sort of stuff you don't want to play for more than ten minutes. Buyer Beware"
5,"Wow! The more I listen to this CD, the more I like it"
2,"ok. i thought from other reviews that i would really like this cd, but I dont really. the delivery seems completely pretentious as another reviewer said. i cant get past that fact. though damn shame is excellent. its the only one that i added to my playlist. in fact i promptly trashed the rest."
1,"OK, I guess after 30+ years of generally spectacular music diamonds, everyone is entitled to plunk down a lump of coal.  That's just what this CD is..a dull clunky lump of coal.   I've been listening to Bonnie for most of those 30+ years.  I still have Streetlights and Home Plate on vinyl.  For the past many years, I didn't even listen to her new music before purchasing.  I just bought em!  There were always bound to be a couple ""popular"" hits and more than a couple undiscovered diamonds on in the tracks.  Not so for this CD.  I Will Not be Broken is acceptable...the rest of the tracks sound almost off key and in some places, even out of tune with herself.   Bonnie is still one of my all time favorite singers - but I wish I would have saved my $$ and not blindly purchased this one."
4,"I understand that many of you who have bought this CD will be Broadway lovers (and I am one myself)and you will be used to the lead roles having amazing powerful voices. But just as important as good singing is good acting. I think that Ann interpreted Roxie as a wannabe who had the enthusiasm but lacked the talent, which makes her raspy tones and sing-speak completely plausible. It also supports the theme that you can use other things than talent to get yourself to the top This may not be the way you like Roxie played, but you shouldn't shun Ann's interpretation. It's a good thing if there is more than one way of having a character played, I think so anyway. Personally I love the Miramax film, but I enjoy comparing these 2 and seeing the differences"
4,"Being a fan of The Divine Comedy since they released Casanova in 1996, I was really looking forward to their latest album. Much like a lot of previous releases by The DC, this album takes a few listens to fully appreciate it. When I first listened to it, I was disappointed with most of the early tracks and didn't listen beyond track 7. However, repeated listens have definitely added a great deal to my enjoyment of this collection. Track-by-track:  1. To Die A Virgin - Amusing lyrics, but the melody doesn't do anything for me. Opinion seems to be very divided on most of the tracks here, this being no exception. It sounds a bit flat to me.  2. Mother Dear - An unusual country track with a catchy melody, but a far too repetitive chorus. Musically it's great, but the constant repetition of ""Mother Dear"" quickly becomes tiresome.  3. Diva Lady - Not bad, but hardly the strongest of melodies penned by Neil Hannon. Annoyingly it sticks in your head - I'd rather it didn't!  4. A Lady Of A Certain Age - Beautiful melodies, wonderful instrumentation, and moving lyrics. I've always liked Hannon's voice, but this is the kind of track his singing is best suited to. Stunning.  5. The Light Of Day - A bright, upbeat melody, again with some beautiful instrumentation - strings and harpsichord really add to the classical rock style that the DC have always done so well.  6. Threesome - A charming 1 minute piano instrumental that provides a good break in the middle of the album.  7. Party Fears Two - Elsewhere I've hear people calling The Plough pompous; if any track sounds pompous, it is this one. I haven't heard the original but the strings are overdone for a riff that isn't all that special. The chorus is better than the verse, but this just sounds out of place here.  8. Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World - This one's quite odd. I didn't expect to like it at all but it really grows on you. Great lyrics, a very enjoyable melody and plenty of decoration around the various melodies. Very well composed indeed.  9. The Plough - As I mentioned earlier, I couldn't disagree more with the notion that this track sounds pompous. It's an absolute masterpiece. A wonderful build-up in each verse and throughout the track. A similar feel to The Certainty of Chance or Freedom Road, this is one of the best tracks I have ever heard from the DC.  10. Count Grassi's Passage Over Piedmont - The opening melody links well from The Plough. Great melodies throughout, an unusual mix of spoken/sung lyrics, not dissimilar to The Booklovers - but much easier to hear more than a few times over. Very special, and unique!  11. Snowball In Negative - Yet again, the orchestral arrangements are superb. Interesting contrast between the vocal sections and the piano solos, showing that Threesome wasn't such an anomaly after all. The ending is a little unexpected and slightly drawn out, but this track wraps up the album well.  Apart from the first few tracks, this is possibly the best DC album I've ever heard. It's right up there with Promenade and Fin De Siecle and is a welcome reminder that Hannon is highly unlikely to lose his touch anytime soon. Beautiful"
4,"For his ""2nd"" solo album (even though this as well as ""Life in 1472"" have guests on most to all of the songs), JD did a good job.  I'm not a huge fan of his but this album is solid.  Guests are mostly to thank for that, as well as some great production (that he always seems to pull off).  Of the 13 songs on here (it does have a lot of skits/interludes) 1 is a classic, 1 or 2 are near classics, 4 are ok, 1 I skip, and the rest are good. For those who have heard JD before, you know what to expect, songs about women and flashing and flautin his money, nothing new.  Production is also good, JD takes part in 11 of the songs (he produces 1 and co-produces 10) and Swizz Beats & Neptunes each do a song.  I'd recommend this album for his fans or fans of that kind of rap.  #2 - 10 (CLASSIC -- great beat -- f/ Ludacris -- also onone of his albums) #3 - 8 (f/ UGK & Manuel Seal) #5 - 7 (f/ Boo, Gotti, Usher, R.O.C.) #7 - 9.5  (f/ Jadakiss & a good hook from Freeway -- nice beat) #8 - 8.5 (f/ Nate Dogg) #9 - 7 (f/ Bilal) #11 - 9.5 (great beat -- f/ Manish Man) #13 - 8.5 (f/ Nate Dogg, R.O.C., Trey Lorenz, Katrina -- nice beat) #14 - 8 (f/ Clipse -- also on their ""Lord Willin"" Album) #15 - 9 (f/ Jagged Edge -- great beat and story) #16 - 7.5 (f/ Kurupt, Field Mob, Eddie Cain, Backbone) #18 - 5.5 (f/ Da Brat & Kandi) #20 - 7 (F/ Xscape)  Jermaine Dupri -- b. 9/23/73 -- Atlanta, GA check all my review"
1,"Hey, didn't you have a girlfriend who liked this guy? Remember driving around, another Sat nite of getting nowhere, hearing this guy, ""Maggie May"", thinking, ""didn't they just play that already?"" Remember beer-soaked carpets, butts and roaches lying around, stoned and drunk and bored? Remember the stories about this guy getting hauled into an ER at four in the morning in New York or LA or someplace, what they pumped out of his stomach? Is is still around? Does somebody still listen to him? Hey, is this the same guy as Joe Cocker?"
4,"I think this is one of the best films I've seen in this life. I always wondered what they did to represent a date in the past as well as they did while I watched the movie. The music was a major groundbreaker in helping creating a totally nerve wrecking feeling of belonging to the past.  This is music for the mind. It seems to speak a language of its own. I didnt know that I liked scores and instruments before I heard the music of ""Road to Perdition""   Its so complete in its mesmerising process that it makes me want to salute it. Certainly the best music I've heard for any film. I liked the music to ""The Village"" too. Passion Of The Christ is another favourite"
5,"After hearing this cd for the first time, I knew I wanted to buy it.  I also bought this as a gift for a friend and she has been thanking me ever since"
1,"First, I should remind you, Dear Reader, that since italics, boldface type, and underlines can't be used in these kind of reviews, I have to use one capital letter in some mid-sentence words to slightly stress them and use all capitals to stress other words even more!       Anyway, one star on this review is one star too many to give this album and band.       I received this album as a gift for my birthday while I was on the other side of the country.  I'd never even Heard of this band until then, much less any of their songs by pure and simple osmosis.  When I finally got around to taking it out of the wrapping and putting it into the CD player of my car on the way to work and back, I was not impressed with the opening song, nor the second, nor the third, etcetera, and so on, and so forth ...       I kept wondering if this coma-inducing drone (interrupted only by the screaming of the word ""Nothing"" at least 20 times at the end of the first song) was some kind of tactical build-up by the band so they could eventually break out a song that made them at least Somewhat Big (much less a hit) to start the party.        You know the kind of song I mean, don't you, Dear Reader?  I mean the kind of song that makes you think ""Whoa!  Who's THIS?!"" because it has a either a great opening, or a great first line or four, or at least Something to grab your attention within the first minute, like Ani DiFranco's song ""Out of Range"" would do in less than 16 seconds.       Anyway, MANY extremely torturous minutes later, the 9th song came along (ironically for me, it's called ""Wishful Thinking"") and I honestly couldn't take anymore of this DRIVEL!  I gave this band A Whole NINE TRIES to make something that at least Resembles an impression and all I got was only Slightly less musical boredom as when I did when I once tried to listen to the only bad album I currently know by Tangerine Dream: ""ZEIT"".  That album, by the way, was basically four 20-minute bits of what seemed like people in an orchestra tuning up their instruments and eventually matching one single note with each other BEFORE the conductor starts a symphony you never get to hear.      As I said, this album is only a micrometer less boring.       I honestly cannot understand how anyone who scouts for the music industry could have happened along this sorry excuse for a band and thought to themselves ""WOW!  These guys are On FIRE!  I must get them to the studio and P.R. them IMMEDIATELY!!""       Let me put it this way, Dear Reader: Remember that song ""Next Time I Fall In Love"" by Peter Cetera and Amy Grant back in the mid to late 1980's?  In comparison to the so-called songs on this album, that cutesy ballad will sound more intense and energetic than ""Paranoid"" by Black Sabbath.      Maybe Wilco got their record contract by winning a contest of who could bore an audience the quickest.       Oh, and if you're wondering to yourself, ""Oh yeah? Well,  let's see this guy (as in ME) make a Better album!""        I already Have made a better album and I'll gladly show it to you.  Leave me a response to this review if you want that proof.  AAAaaannnnnd ... CUT! That's a wrap"
1,"Darryl Worley's ""Have You Forgotten"" begs another, more relevant question -- ""Do You Read the Paper."" Despite the fact that Hussein's Iraq had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks, he justifies our illegal invasion and occupation of that sovereign nation with references to the Twin Towers. To xenophobes like Worley, the Middle East is just one big nation of indistinguishable brown people. He justifies our warmaking with cliched references to ""our freedom,"" apparently oblivious to the irony that the Patriot Act -- passed in reaction to 9/11 -- has effectively cancelled the Bill of Rights. He accepts the Official Version of 9/11, despite the fact that the story has holes big enough to fly an airplane through. I've heard some pretty reactionary stuff on country radio before, but this song definitely takes the cake."
1,Come on.  I cannot play these dual discs in my car nor any regular CD players. J&MC are excellent though
4,"Technically,this is New Edition minus Bobby Brown,Ralph Tresvant and Johnny Gill. Brown,by 1990 when this album was released,was enjoying a successful solo career,especially from many sales of his second 1988 release DON'T BE CRUEL. Tresvant released his self-titled debut also. So the remaining three NE members Ricky Bell,Michael Bivins and Ronnie DeVoe became Bell Biv Devoe. You can see on the album cover that one member has the official NE logo on his sweatshirt. These guys started their musical careers as typical R&B artists in 1983(Jackson 5 clones,vocally). And now they're ""hippin' and hoppin'""! NE released their debut CANDY GIRL in '83,the self-titled album followed the following year,and between then and 1988,released three more albums."
2,I was thinking along the lines of the daughter father duo of Nat King Cole and  daughter. This was some what not up to what I was looking for. Skip it
2,"poor album. the song 'rocks' is almost identical with any songs of Black Crowers, and even they look alike.and i can't believe is Primal Scream i'm hearing. Primal Scream really has something better to do"
5,"Jon B. returns with his sophomore efforts with a more relaxing feel with Cool Relax.  11 of the fifteen were either written or co-wrote by Jon and seven of the fifteen were produced by Jon B. himself.  With hands on experience, this release becomes more personal and touching for its listeners.  For the most part, ""Bad Girl"" has the fastest tempo and blended well with the direction of the LP.  Hearing Jon reach for the higher notes on ""Can't Help It"" was a good display of talent and range as it is altered throughout the song for an appealing tone was quite impressive.  The title track was more or less a jazz tune with an upbeat drum track.  2Pac was featured with equal time on ""Are You Still Down"" as he almost stole the show until near the end where Jon B. flexed his abilities.  ""I Do (Whatcha Say Boo)"" is a song about being in a relationship for some time until he finally pops the question of being married.  He then admits how his woman makes him want to stay home instead of hanging with the boys on ""I Ain't Going Out"".  The inviting ""Can We Get Down"" is seductive as the question itself as he questions his desires to be with someone sexually.  Hearing Jon croon in another language on ""Tu Amor"" sends this album to heights of a climax indeed in tuned with the title.  There's nothing missing here except maybe the company of someone to enjoy this with"
2,"Where the hell is the melody, the song? Just fragments of invention that rarely gel into a work of art. I think Wayne is playing the role of Miles, but has not controled his men in the same way. -think I'm crazy? Listen and judge. j"
1,"If you happen upon the video for MakeDamnSure and the sound on your television is off, then you would think that the band Taking Back Sunday is ripping one hell of a energetic and explosive tune.  They look like the MC5 in the video, jumping off amps, winging guitars around there head, looking serious as all hell.  But if your like me and you turn the sound back on, your going to hear that it's another whiny and droning effort from the emo machine designed to make kids in high school feel self important.    I was asked to listen to this by one of my friends.  I gave it an honest to god listen, but I couldn't handle it for too long.  Being earnest is fine, but stop with this emo stuff.  You'd think after the fiftieth clone of the same band that eventually the comsumers of this stuff would realize that it's all the same. If you like emo, please, buy 13 Songs by Fugazi.  They practically invented the genre, but I actually buy what they do.  I don't buy this crap, this is just the same drivel that i've been hearing for ever.  Avoid at all costs. "
5,"VH1's We are the 80's introduced me to this wonderful album. The video for ""Running up that it hill"" captured my total attention. I was very delighted to find that the extended version of this song is also included as an extra track. The rest of the CD has multiple and diversified musical surprises. Overall and keeping in mind that this is a recording from the late 80's it is worth the price."
2,"I got these CDs based on some reviews, but I can not take the singing.  There are far too many little kids singing, and the adults are no better.  It is WAY too gimmicky.  If you want just traditional songs sung nicely, this is not the set for you!  I am going to copy the songs I like and make my own CD - I think there are maybe 2 songs per CD I'll use!  BAD"
1,"Well, the Young Gunz basically suck.  Their lyrics are very weak and wack and the choruses they come with are extremely lame.  They also have very generic voices and flows which make for a boring listen.  The production as a whole is decent at best.  However, this album is 100 times better than the atrocity that is Memphis Bleek - 534.  But it's still not good. JayZ needs to clean the rap house and get rid of these 'guys' that call themselves rappers.  He should keep Kayne, Sigel, and Freeway and then cut the deck and start recruiting.  Young Gunz & Memphis Weak just don't have what it takes to carry simple songs let alone the entire Roc for years to come.  Please JayZ for the sake of the Roc's good name...get rid of these tag along bums bringing it down.  1 star"
5,"this album was everywhere around the time i was entering my senior year of high school,and for good reasons too.this album is so raw,hard edged,chilling and gritty.it has a verry dark sense of urgency,and ghetto desperation.  it even has undertones of the occult like the mr quija song.also songs like no surrender(wich has a sick chorus!)deal with the frustration that inner city youth has with law inforcement(wich seems like another gang in some ghettos).and the song is layered with hardcore rebelious lyrics.especially from wish bone of all people when he talks about the cops arresting him and he says   ""Puttin' me on my knees, tellin' me move and I'm dead, 'cause I'm killin' all your b*tches, turnin' them blue suits red. And then I'm comin' to that funeral to shoot that b*tch up, because I know that's where y'all b*tches is bound to meet up. Cop killas, all up in they chest, and I know what to do with that vest, man Twenty-two shots.  I killa. You don't wanna f**k with Bone, nigga. And it really ain't sh*t to pull a trigger on a copper, 'cause if I go down, some of y'all goin' down,  'cause I'm goin' down poppin, so motherf**k all coppers, Let me catch you slippin', nigga, bet I pop ya""  and the title track creepin on ah come up gives off the vibe of young inner city desperation.especialy in the first verse verse by krayzie bone when he says  ""Woke up this morning with the thoughts of Robbin' a bank to get rich, ain't ate in days so it ain't no thang to click click b***h, gimme yo s**t.""   also lazie bone's verse echos the same sentiment   ""See, I'm sittin' in my room, and a nigga feelin' down, steady thinkin' 'bout how to get paid. Gotta gauge at my waist that be  spellin' out murder that'll get a nigga locked the cage. Lay my head to bed, start to thinkin' hard, money is the cause. What can  I do me for? Need to hit a lick, not a bullsh*t, but a real lick, like robbin' a jewelery store.""  those verses pretty much sums up this album,so do the verse where bizzy bone said he took his conscience and fried them (with weed) after he robbed someone.  but lets not forget the hit singles like thugish rugish bone wich is bone's signiture song along with tha cross roads.and who can forget for the love of money song wich has great verses from flesh-n-bone(whom is arguably the most overlooked memeber),and the late great eazy-e.  flesh-n-bone- "" Gotta get on the grind Pop in the clip of my nine And b*tch if you slip You hit the chalk and fall in the night time Gotta get mine Ain't takin no shorts or no losses Hop on the phone Callin' my nigga sin at home Polishin' that MAC-10 crome Gotta a lick so bring yo sh*t Cause once again it's on To the dome with a fifth of burb we wig to the curb so we swerve And rolled out to pick up the triple six thug And follow the murder for robbin the dopehouse Smoke jump outta me bong So high, now comin' to slay with four grenades and a gauge I'm a play, watch all 'em fall in the grave and lay Pullin' in the driveway, Wish spotted the place and quickly rolled up Bulldozed through the living room Hopped out of the car and started to blow up Buck, Buck, and a kaboom Me blew all them bodies all over the room Them doomed""   bad ass verse from flesh lol,eazy-e comes hard too with this verse  ""Standin' on the corner straight slangin' rocks Aw sh*t! Here comes the muthaf**kin' cops! So I dash, I ducks, and I hides behind a tree Makin' sure the muthaf**kas don't see me Now my fat sack of rocks hell yeah i stuffed 'em  Police on my draws, i had to pause And yeah, it's still muthaf**k 'em Now my game is tight, tight as f**k is my game Easy muthaf**kin E or Eric Wright it's all the same  Now niggas might trip on how I stash my grip I gotta have it b*tch For the love of this sh*t MUTHAF**KA!!""  what a great verse from eazy-e,and its one of my favorites by him.  i also love the bass heavy down for my thang and i like how the song fades out with bone harmonizing the chorus as the song fades out.the intro with the quintet harmonizing along with down for my thang made me understand the relevence of the term HARMONY in the groups name.and after hearing the aformentioned 2 songs i kinda got the style and the jist of the group.  and in turn i couldn't wait for their follow up.because their sound was so melodic/smooth yet hard edged and hard as nails.it was unlike anything i heard before.i will admit though i too wonder how good this album would have been if it was a full LP instead of a EP.but ""as is"" its a great rap album that gives you only a taste of whats to come from this underrated but legendary group"
5,"YA SHOULD GET DIS CUZ ITS GOTS DA BEST SUPER PRODUCES PAUL & JUICY, DIS CD IS NOW A CLASSIC AND 1 OF DA BEST CDS THEY EVER MADE,YA KEEP LOOKIN OUT FOR FOR MORE FIRE CD'S DAT ARE GOIN 2 COME OUT LATER DIS YEAR LIKE- PROJECT PAT CROOK BY DA BOOK DA FEDS STORY, BOOGEY MANE OUT OF DA CLOSET, LIL WYTE 3RD TIMES THE CHARM,AND YA KEEP LOOKIN OUT FOR THREE 6 MAFIA PRODUCTION FOR OTHER ARTISTS LIKE CHINGY, NELLY, ALI & GIPP, LYFE JENNINGS, GLC, 8BALL & MJG AND THERE  ALSO PROLLY GOIN 2 WORK WITH JAY-Z IN HES NEW CD, ITS REALLY GOIN DOWN THREE 6 MAFIA ARE ON TOP OF DA GAME! DEFEAT DOES NOT EXIT IN DIS CAMP"
2,I bought this album because I liked her version of Underdog Victorious on Mountain Stage in Winter 2005.  I was disappointed with the version of Underdog Victorious on this album.  Her singing on the Mountain Stage show seemed more energetic and heartfelt whereas this album version seemed flat in comparison.  The album in general just sounds like a really young Sheryl Crow
5,"This is a great CD. It is not quite as good as Quality, but it is a mix CD so you can't expect it to be. The raps and rhymes are great. I think Ms. Hill is one of Kweli's finest songs. The only problem is the beats are a little sub par for Kweli, but still a very good album anyways"
4,"Wow I just don't know where to start with this album.Well, about the album itself: I think this is best explained by the band, so here's what they think- ""How Strange, Innocence"" was our first attempt at an album. We recorded it in January 2000 in Austin: recording took two days, mixing one day, mastering one day. Altogether we pressed 300 CD-R copies of this album...We had been a band about seven months when we recorded these songs. A lot of feelings (excitement/confusion/glimpses of visions/waking dreams/inability to play instruments) went into this record, but we didn't quite know what to do with those feelings, none of us had even really been in a studio before, and it shows in the recording, the songs show it, too--it's a young record. There are no tricks in it. There's a lightness in a few of the songs that we probably won't reach again. It sounds strange to say that instrumental songs are about something, but to us these songs were/are about such things as a couple walking through the park on a winter day, a child playing on 70's shag carpet, the story of a boy hero leading a revolution against the tyranny of the coal mines. We've had a bit of a love/embarrassment relationship with the record. At certain points along the way several of us wanted to buy back all the copies and burn them. Listening now to this album, it almost seems like a different band composed of four different people. We finally feel okay in re-releasing it, probably because we've now made a couple of records that are recorded better and that are closer to our visions for them. Anyway, we truly appreciate anyone who is interested and listening. Thank you.""  That was on the CD itself- hope you found that helpful. I like this CD for two reasons. 1.The wonderful way Explosions in the Sky can tell a story through their instruments. 2.This album has a distinct sound- one all its own. If you didn't like Explosions in the sky before, you will once you listen to this album. -Sherman. "
1,"Yes, this is the great PBBB's 3rd album, but it's not the CD you should be buying.  This domestic CD was released in 1989 and has never been remastered.    The import 2CD version of this title (backed with the PBBB's 4th ""In My Own Dream"") is the one to get.  It was remastered in 2004.  Ditto for ""The Paul Butterfield Blues Band"" & ""East West""; the 2004 import 2CD is also remastered (and sounds incredible) and the domestic CD's are not.  Why WEA and Elektra have not made these four remasters available domestically is a mystery.  Don't waste your money on these inferior versions: Get the imports"
1,all this dude does is release bubble gum garbage songs like whatyou know about that etc. well mr ti what you know about rap. cause ya sure dont get any lyrical skills i hope you dont think you are going to make people think you are king of the south with garbage like this
2,"I bought this album due to the song ""Soak up the sun"".  I was dissappointed when it was the only good song on the cd.  I still believe Sheryle Crow keeps it real(Just not on this album)"
1,"As a big fan of the Postal Service (their ""Give Up"" easily makes the cut on my top 10 albums), I had high expectations for this Dntel record, as Jimmy Tamberello is one half of the Postal Service. BIG mistake. Listen to the samples: if you like what you hear, then buy it; if you don't like what you hear, don't make my mistake of thinking that the songs get better beyond the 30 seconds given. Worthwhile songs on this CD: 1)""(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan"" (The Postal Service remix is available on iTunes, and is a better version than what's on the CD), sung by Ben Gibbard of Death Cab and Postal Service. 2)""Last Songs"" is if anything, relaxing. I recommend getting these two songs on iTunes and leaving it at that, save some money.  The CD's too expensive for two decent songs.  Jimmy Tamberello has another digital project that he works called Figurine and (more recently) James Figurine, it's essentially a catchier, poppier version of Dntel, more in line with Postal Service"
5,"Excellent work from a local band from my own hometown.  Very unique stuff to say the least - I know of nothing that compares.  Though you should check this out if you dig Hank III's new album, or vice-versa.  Dark Country at its best"
5,"this album stands as stong as it ever did the original joe jackson band was far more tallented than they ever got credit for.but here it is One More Time,Is She Really Going Out With Him and the great Sunday Papers .yes they maybe a little dated but these were great times.you can hear it in the music"
5,"I thought ""Delirium Tremolos"" was the ultimate display of Ray Wylie Hubbard's style & talent, then I listened to ""Snake Farm"". Wow! I didn't think RWH's essence could be distilled down any further after ""DT"", but with ""Snake Farm"" I was hooked from the first riff & didn't come up for air until the cd changer kicked in at the end. This stuff is 100 proof Hubbard. Honey, it's all good, down to the last drop"
5,"My mother gave me this CD over a year ago and I couldn't find any feedback about the album. The album wasn't in the stores either. Whomever compiled the songs did an excellent job and it touched me like his 1st album did. I played it so much that the CD player scratched it. Fortunately, Soulife is out now and I can purchase it to support Anthony. Anybody that loves his 1st will love this one and Ain't Nobody Worryin' as well. He is a must see in concert"
1,"I GOT THE ABOVE TITLE FROM ANOTHER VENDER AND THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO SEND THIS ONE AND THIS IS ABSOLUTLY THE BEST ROCKABILLY ON RECORD/CD.  COLUMBIA RECORDS WAS NOT KNOWN FOR THEIR ROCK AND ROLL IN THE 50'S AND IF THIS IS NOT ROCK AND ROLL I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.  GET THIS CD AND THE COMPANION ""AIN'T I'M A DOG"". YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU DID"
1,"not what I was expecting from him. Everyone out there knows Boney is a fantastic saxophonist. However, this album left much to be desired. I wonder why he left Paul Brown, his former producer. He released some excellent albums with Paul brown. I don't think he's doing well enough on his own. I did not find any track particularly mind-blowing. If anyone that really knows boney doubts this, perhaps you ought to listen to ""seduction"" and ""sweet thing"" before making any comments. This latest album is nothing compared to those two. woork harder boney. I would not advise anyone new to Jazz to buy this album."
2,"if you knew me, you would probably know that i love punk music....old epitaph bands tickle my fancies greatly..they days when epitaph was THE punk label..you know, the label with all the re-mastered classics, plus phenomenal newer acts   anyways, until recently, this whole new emo/screamo thing was getting on my nerves...mainly for the reason that it was being labeled as ""Punk."" yes, this compilation still contains bad religion and pennywise..which is great..i mean i would never buy this for just 2 decent songs and i still pretty much hate new emo, but i can respect epitaph records now that they ditched ""punk o rama"" since they contain very little punk.   epitaph has a great extension in Hellcat Records to appease the punks/skins...i would surely recommend that someone pick up the ""give em the boot"" compilations if they want punk rock.  now, the only thing i really despise epitaph for these days is the fact that they have so many classics that are out of print and near impossible to find!   bottom line, if you want punk go to hellcat, if you want new emo and other oddity musicians come to this, the new phase of punk o rama. 2 stars because i dont really care for this, but it earns my respect"
1,"Yo, don't take this the wrong way because I'm not a hater but rather a big biggie fan. But this album is terrible. Its nothing but easy money for greedy producers by using old Biggie verses and whipping up new beats. Biggie certainly didn't leave very much unreleased material unlike Tupac then again I suppose he wasn't expecting he was going to die. But they still shouldn't do s*** like this. If you want to support Biggie's legacy this year which isn't a bad idea, pick up one of the classics - Ready 2 Die or Life After Death."
5,After watching the parade of nations in the opening ceremony of athen s 04.... I had to buy this CD... is amazing....
1,SAD THAT PHIL WENT THE WAY OF POP DIVA...HORRIBLE...MAKES ALL PROGRESSIVE FANS CRINGE...SHOULD MAKE ALL MUSIC FANS CRINGE
5,This is a no-brainer... it's Sesame Street songs... every kid loves 'em. Nothing bad to say at all... your kids like Big Bird? Get 'em this CD
5,"There are people out there listening to the radio. They want to be rescued. Long since tired of riding dirty on a honkytonk badonkadonk that makes one want to la-la, there are some that would argue that Y2K was really the day the music died. (If not even sooner, but those folks didn't like Nirvana, Alice in Chains or Soundgarden. Go figure.)  Well, anyone who's heard ""Gentlemen"" or ""Congregation"" or any other record by the Afghan Whigs should be yelling ""Rescue me, Dulli!"" And on ""Powder Burns,"" Greg's delivered the goods.  Possibly the most soul-infused yet forward-thinking rock record since the Whigs' ""Black Love,"" the new Twilight Singers record still shouldn't be construed as an Afghan Whigs album without the name. Despite Dulli wearing lead singer shoes, which definitely aids in stamping any project with a signature raspy-throated, tunelessly-endearing sound, the backing band and instrumentation are a far cry from the rabies-inflicted punk animal that was the Whigs. Sure, it's dirty, dirty, grungy blues-rock, but one might be surprised what creeps into a song here and there. ""Bonnie Brae"" is a melancholy headbanger that could almost be called blue-collar shoegaze. Piano and violin pepper tracks like ""There's Been An Accident,"" while rushing, watery electronic influence is lovingly splashed here and there, most obviously on the intro piece ""Toward the Waves""/""I'm Ready.""  Of course to think ahead, people usually end up looking back to see how good music was made in the first place. Dulli liked smashing Beatles riffs around on his covers record so much that he's taken to purloining lyrics, too, reframing the timeless refrain of ""She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah"" with a derisive sneer and a cranky guitar din (""Forty Dollars"").  Not every word on ""Powder Burns"" is an homage, however. Lyrically, Dulli has always struck me as a singing Charles Bukowski. Sometimes it's exactly who you need to hear from to fall asleep at night when you're too bleary-eyed to read"
5,Received the CD in a timely fashion. It was just what I wanted
2,"Johnny, what happened? A very whimpy John Prine, not the ""Sam Stone"" biting commentary I remember when. I bought this thinking I'd give Prine another chance. Unless he turns around on that road he's starting down, it'll be the last chance I give him"
1,Don't Buy it. Be warned. It's stupid. You will regret it is the worst possible thing that has come to musicals and hopefully will be the last
5,"this album good. me like very much.if you no like it, go f*** yourself. if you no like it, you suck more then me english. Actually, my english is not bad at all. This album is great. The beat can be memorized until doomsday and Eminem kicked a**. But Bizzare stunk,except he was pretty good on one track. But Bizzare's crappy voice and flows does not screw up this album. Go buy this album now. When you hear it, you will go crazy over it. If you don't, the Devil is ready to welcome you into hell."
1,"I was just going to write another on of my moronic reviews, but i couldn't stand anything about the album.    I hate good charlotte, they sound EXACTLY like every other prep-rock band (fall out boy, my chemical romance, simple plan ect.) I could tell simply by comparing the name of the album to the ""song"" names that this had nothing to do with life or death, and considering their preppy reputation that there would be no hidden meanings withing the songs. After i listened to a couple of these so called ""songs"" i turned it off, and quickly threw it out of the window.        My point being, with bands such as this, don't expect anything hidden within the title, or the music. It will just be a boring listen the entire way through. If you were looking for an album that DOES have meaning, and is fun to listen too. I suggest eating your own exrement"
5,"With Stanley Road Paul Weller has managed to prove to his fans and his critics that he is still an important musician even in his solo days. He hasn't written 12 good songs, instead, he's written one great album. A factor in any great album is the overall feel that perpetuates each song, making them all feel as though they deserve their place and complimenting the songs that come before and after them.  A mostly guitar driven album, Weller fuses good solos and riffs with his usual effective lyrics, often ending a song with a long instrumental that gently ushers in the next song, which gladly and competently carries the album along. However, there is the occasional song that primarily uses the piano evoking another great feel. Though these songs are quite different from the guitar based ones, they seem to come at just the right points in the album so that, not only are they a nice change of direction, but also they effortlessly fit in.  Stand-out songs are 'you do something to me', 'broken stones', 'the changing man', 'I walk on gilded splinters' and of course the title track. To truly appreciate this fine album start at the beginning and just let it play on to the end. It far outweighs the sum of its parts, and as these parts are so good, you're in for a great journey."
1,"I love hip hop and anything that has a beat to it and I liked 'It's goin' down' when I heard it on the radio. However, I just listened to sample tracks on amazon for this cd and came across 'Dope boy magic.' When I heard him rap about 9/11 I was immediately turned off and enraged. How could he rap about something that tragic?! Does he think it boosts his image or will sell him more records?! Hopefully not! This is disgusting! I hope anyone that wants to buy this piece of crap listens to 'Dope boy magic' (and more than likely others too, but I didn't stick around to listen) before purchasing to see for themselves what a SOB this guy is."
5,"When I first heard ""The Dollar"" on the radio, I was floored.   Not only by the touching lyrics, but also by the traditional sound.   I could tell that the guy singing it had a deep love for traditional country music, and was someone who stayed true to his roots.  After listening to this album, I still say all that.  THE DOLLAR is a great traditional country record.  Sure, there are the contemporary ""redneck anthems""--""Rebelicious,"" ""Redneck Side of Me,"" even to an extent ""Keepin' Up With the Jonesin""--but they are still better than a lot of their cousin songs.   Johnson's true country gift, however, comes across in other ways.   The enjoyable ""Flying Silver Eagle"" is one of the countriest songs I've heard in a long time (""I couldn't put my past behind me, so I put it in a song"").   ""She's All Lady"" is a touching tribute to the woman at home, and ""Back to Carolina"" is a powerful number.   ""My Saving Grace"" is an ode to the power of blood over alcohol (""Daddy passed out with his demons, Mama passed the offering plate...Daddy kept the Devil off my back by taking up His time"").  The CD ends with the stirring and inspirational gosel number ""Lead Me Home.""  Jamey Johnsom, from all appearances, seems the direct musical descendent of George Jones, Hank Jr., Merle Haggard, Waylon, and others--he's a traditional-leaning artist with what may come off as attitude, but what is really, in fact, simple honesty.   THE DOLLAR is one of the best country albums I've heard in a long time.  Yes, yes, he's the guy who co-wrote ""Honky Tonk Badonkadonk,"" but for true die-hard country fans, Johnson is more likely to be remembered for the tunes he recorded here...and any more he gets the chance to record in his career.   His voice is undeniably country, his writing skills are formidable, and his taste in traditional country music is unwavering.   God--and the music industry--willing, Jamey Johnson will have a long career ahead of him.  Lord knows, he's the right man to give country music a much-needed injection of traditionalism"
2,"After reading such good reviews, I decided to buy the CD.  Only to discover it is not my kind of music.  This is like a kindergarten kind of music. "
5,"When will Elfman get his due credit. The man is one of the most versitile composers of his day, and has not been awarded a thing. Personally I think that Nightmare before Christmas was his best. But Corpse Bride was fantastic. He know how to fit into Burton's visions perfectly"
1,"""A Collection of Short Stories will go down as one of the best debut albums of any band."" That, I'm afraid, is a real review...someone actually listened to this and decided that it is so good that it deserves to be ranked among the greatest debuts ever weezer - the blue album led zepplin - self titled  creedence clearwater revival the cure the pixies  queen red hot chili peppers sublime the violent femmes death cab for cutie  houston calls ....one of these bands are not like the others, one of these bands just dont belong.. truth is, I heard this cd before I even listened to it.  This style is hackneyed and killed. It's been so long since a genuinely good band has been seen as cool that even the critics are starting to forget what good music sounds like.  ""200 miles that sure is far""...thats a real line on this cd. but whatever, this is what amazing is these days..this is where generations of integrity has brought us in music..its a lost cause because in the end i guess it really is all about the dollar.  The music industry is one of the most unstable industries out there. no one knows how they are going to look financially in the next ten years..so what  do they do? they take the quick cash in..they sign crap like this that no one has to think about. easy music, easy dollar. building a band is too much of a risk these days..now instead of building them and improving them, they produce them..autotuner, cut and paste music...so sure this is a great cd and everyone needs to check it out because we all need to chip in on drive thru/rushmore's new escalade with chrome hydrolics..at least the rap industry is honest about where the money goes"
2,"My daughter asked for this cd after seeing it advertised on nickelodeon.  While most of it is fine, specifically the Veronica's song talks about spending the night with a guy and giving him the ""ride of his life"".  Not really what I had in mind for my 9 yr old"
5,"The futuristic vibe they get on this album is outstanding. Intelligence is Sexy is a great song, so is Tears Have No Name and Espirit De Corps is outstanding. Every other song is very solid. The vocals have this vibe that no other band creates, the vocals are nearly alien in nature. If you like metal songs that get into a groove and keep it buy this album. They are kind of, in a weird way, an actualized Voivod for the new century"
2,A friend of mine told me that this was a great cd. Now i do like they might be giants but this is crude compaired to Flood or Lincon. Which were much better     Only about 3 song are any good. Skip this one and get Floo
5,"Screams & Wisphers is another great CD from Edwin McCain and his band. The song Couldnt love you more is a great song for lovers that have ever had doubters about there love, Edwin McCain is in my opinion one of the best singer song writers out, the way he makes you feel the songs and stories with his words is something only true artist can do. Not a big radio artist but that keeps him grounded and not caught up in the HOLLYWOOD sell out that so many of these so called artist give into - A great cd by a great artist and worth twice the price the sticker has on it, nothing Edwin McCain puts out is bad, if your a true fan of REAL music youll love anything Edwin McCain puts ou"
1,"Other than Heavy Metal Drummer, this album is totally mediocre. This album is perhaps the most overated, overhyped alternative album of all time. I do not see what all the fuss was about. I guess that sums up Wilco for me in general. I could not name another song on this album because none of the other tracks are worth remembering. Download Heavy Metal Drummer off a paysite and skip this album at all costs"
5,"I fell in love with the cardigans when I was 10 with ""Lovefool.""  At the time I liked the mindless bubblegum quality, but now, 9 years later I'm (amazingly) still in love with them, though for different reasons.  They grew with me, I guess, and when I think of the music of my childhood, the cardigans are it for me.  It's crazy that after listening to them for so many years I still enjoy them so much, but their music just doesn't get old.  If you're debating, just try it!  at first the blatant pop my get on your nerves, but I like it because it's.... unapologetically pop.  try Dressy bessy if you like the cardigans "
1,"This CD just goes to prove how great of an influence David was on Pink Floyd's music. Out of the box this album is layed back an colored with many subtle textures, it's mellow ambience transports you to dreamy mindscapes. I found the more I listened to it, the more I liked it"
2,"Frank Zappa had a title that is apt for this Norman Brown cd; SHUT UP & play your GUITAR !  Pop arrangements, lots of vocals, and drum machine. No Jazz here.    He is an awesome guitar player, and I really like his earlier cd's. Do yourself a favor and skip this cd"
2,It seems as though the smooth jazz artist are trying to attract the r & b listener.  The cd was done in poor taste and the songs lack creativity as well originality.  Too many vocals.  I would rather here him play his wonderful guitar.  I love Norman Brown but it seems as though he just through this together
4,"this cd is mad nice....  this is mr lifs first offcial lp..  on this one, its a concept cd that talks all about gov and a person tryna live in the system of society and life in america  its takes a few listens to understand it all, but I mostly enjoyed this one....  its not as consistant as ""emergency rations"", which i belive is his BEST work cd...thats my only problem with it....   other than that...if yall like backpacker/politcal rap.. frab this one and akrobatik's balance cd="
5,"Japanese singing is cool to listen to. It is an elegant language that sounds really good in combination with the synthesized pop style..(not synth pop mind you, but keyboard drums and all).  I am sure that if it were done in english, I would look at it the same way I look at britney spears..."
1,"They couldn't let children sing about the ""pelvic thrust"" and had to change lyrics, so what's the point of doing the Time Warp again! ;D And that AWFUL cover of Ghostbusters makes me hurl! :"
1,"Of course I purchased this without previewing any of the songs because it's ""Brad Paisley.""  What a mistake!  Really bad song writing! Bad Song Selection for an album! Horrible attempt at humor and I'm wondering if Little Jimmy Dickens will continue to get speech therapy on all of Brad's albums.  I'll be selling my copy of this new CD.....it's junk"
1,"I have been waiting on 2 cd's for almost two months. I am yet to receive ""Journey of a Gemini"", or ""Blue Collar Music"". If possible, can I be reimbursed, or sent another copy of each cd. Please let me know. Thank you. "
5,"To tell you the truth, I can not find words to explain why this song is so amazing. The first time I heard the album version, I was like ""Why choosing clocks, phones and ABBA samples for a first single? What is Madonna thinking?"" After buying this single and hearing it loud at home, I could not stop dancing (specially the Stuart Price Remix). There is a feeling of ""Leting go, forget your problems, feel free"", not easy to describe everytime you hear it and dance to it. Even after, you will find yourself saying ""Time goes by, so slowly, so slowly, so slowly..."
4,"Great remixes. Not her best, but it ranks up there with her best!! :"
5,"Should have had promotion and been released a lot earlier in memory of the late rapper, great cd, got that ol' school rap fee"
1,"Not terrible, but I don't get the hype.  To me, it's just New Wave Disco-and Disco was bad in the 70's.  Finally, what's this doing in a ""Power Pop"" category?  No freaking way is this remotely Power Pop!  What a disgrace to Power Pop lovers"
5,"As a boy , I hated all country music, because my father hated Rock'n Roll.  But I knew that Hank Williams was something special.  I bought his 40 greatest several years ago, thinking that this was the ultimate collection.  However, for some reason, when this 10 CD collection came out, I bought it.  If anyone thinks Hank Williams was one of the greatest preformers ever based on his hits, YOU NEED TO HEAR THESE CD's.  His versions of songs such as &quot;Cool Water&quot; &quot;The Old Home&quot; &quot;Rocking Chair Money&quot; and many others make his hits seem tame.  These recordings are masterpieces"
1,"this album was pathetic. eminem's first 3 albums were classics. this album, eminem doesn't know what to rap about."
5,"What more is there to say about Danny Elfman's Batman score?  It's one of the most popular and well-known scores of all time.  Thousands of people have written their opinions of it.  What more can I say?  I can say how it affected me personally.  It was the first movie score I ever bought, and it was brought to my attention from my dad when we watched the film together as he said ""listen to this music in the opening credits Riley"".  Since then, my score collection has expanded 400 times, and my life and filmmaking career have thrived because of it.   What can I say, really?  I can't continue to bore you with pointless anecdotes.  I can say that this music is incredible and still in my top 5 of all time.  It's Elfman's best work.  It's heroic, it's dark, it's thematic (I dare you not to whistle the Batman theme when this CD is over), it's operatic, it's over-the-top, it's action packed, it's brilliant from start to finish.  There isn't any wasted space on this album.  Elfman has a job to do, and does it with rarely elsewhere seen success.  He practically created this idea of a ""dark superhero theme"", and while the movie was a slight dissappointment, this CD continues to thrill people of any generation. What can I say?  This score is a masterpiece.  End of discussion. cheers K"
2,I bought this cd many years ago and just now feel the urge to write a review.  I was so disappointed.  I mean the original versions of these songs are good but after listened to half a disc I felt remixed out.  The remixes become boring and just left me thirsty for the original versions.  Also did not like the way the songs were broken out.  One disc is supposed to be mellow and the other is supposed to be jamming but after listening to the disc I wondered why songs appeared on the wrong disc.  There is no flow on these cds.  I am still waiting for the proper greatest hits while this one gathers dust.  Not recommended
4,"I'm pretty new to these guys, figured I'd take some time to dig into German goth since goth is pretty well dead here in the US, by which I mean all the pioneers from the 70's or 80's are either gone, changed tracks, or sold out to that crappy early 90's House Tekno sound.  These guys have a little of that crappy House sound that you would expect from about 99% of the so called German Goth bands now a days (and sadly now Skinny Puppy as well), but it also offers a lot of new an original beats which I can really sink my teeth into, also some of it does kind of tug at the ol' psych a bit, which is a good thing, but it is no where near as amazing as Skinny Puppy was in its glory days...  ...everything pre-process, though the process was still ""pretty good"" for the most part"
5,"I liked the other BRMC albums a lot as well, but I think those had that quality where they were initially catchy and you loved it and thought it was the greatest thing ever, but after a few listens it got kinda tired...  Still good, but you'd think ""oh yeah...""  Howl is the opposite.  It was OK the first time I listened to it, and I kinda liked it, but it didnt really dig it's claws into me.  For that reason it didn't get pulled out of the CD wallet all that often.  Then I put it in one day and thought ""ya know, this is actually pretty good.""   Then I started listening to it some more and thought ""man, this is really, really good!""  Guess what?  Now I love it...  This is definitely a creeper CD, as in - it creeps up on you (yeah, that was a stoner analogy.)    I think ""weight of the world"" is the best song on the CD, but ""howl"" had really grown on me too - but I don't want to harp on the songs too much, this is an album as a whole.  Bands grow up and change, and I'm glad to see that BRMC has done it, and done it well.  They haven't lost their muse or gotten ""softer"" just to try something different -- they've grown and changed and their music shows it.  I remember my freshman year in college when Achtung Baby came out and there were people saying stuff like ""boycott U2 cuz they're sellouts!"" - not realizing that AB would be looked at as probably the most insightful, clever, and musically interesting album of their catalog.  That's what the backlash to Howl reminds me of -- shortsighted and not entirely accurate.    Yeah, people may fear change, and admittedly, some artists try it and look like complete idiots in the process (Chris Gaines, anyone...) but BRMC has actually grown, and if you liked their first 2 CD's I'd say give this one a shot.  It's really good - and I'm proud of 'em for making it.   "
1,"I don't want to hear any more of their music on the radio. It is all just nonsense, and none of it should have ever been made. They are one of the worst hip hop acts in recent memory"
5,"I wasn't a Sarah fan in 1999 when the ""Mirrorball"" tour came through my backyard, where ""Mirrorball"" was recorded live, at Portland Oregon's Rose Garden.  But I had become a fan, and was at her show, when she came through with the ""AfterGlow"" tour.  By the time ""AfterGlow"" was out, I had just discovered the original Mirrorball CD and DVD, and up until the release of this 2-CD set, the original ""Mirrorball"" live CD and DVD were my ""most played"" CD and DVD of my whole 700+ various artist collection.  But even before finishing the first CD of this 2 CD set, I know that I had to have another copy for the car.  Sarah Fan?  You must buy this now.  I promise you won't be disappointed.  It is the full show, with all of her interactions with the crowd, and the sound is better than either of the previously released Mirrorball CD and DVD titles.  I love live music, and this set is a dream come true.  Sarah is a true performer ""live"", and I think is actually at her best when performing ""live"".  Absolutely amazing recording and performance on this newly released 2-CD Full Concert Live set.  And if you get a chance to see her perform, pay whatever it costs to see her show"
4,"If you are looking to add to your beatles collection be forewarned.  This is not your typical Beatles fare.  It is however a good deal better than fair after you get past trying to peg it as a Beatles album.  Its Lennon.  He's pissed off.  He has a lot to say and he says it all on this record.  He sings these songs like he has wanted to sing them forever but was never allowed.  He breaks these songs out like they are part of a therapy session and he doesnt turn back.  This album on 1st listen is a bit of a disappointment to me.  On 2nd listen you know what its all about and you dont listen for pop hits, you listen for the album as you heard it the first time.  The only way most people will enjoy this album is after a few listens especially if your going into it with a preconceived notion.  Also a lot of songs on this album have a rocky start and then pick up steam in the middle.  This album is ultimately very good once you know what your getting into.  Its Lennon breaking the chains from the Beatles and really from himself.  After the 3rd listen, it immediately made sense to me.  Now i cant put it down"
2,"except for Ray of Light, which is one of the best pop songs of 90s, the Power of Goodbye, Beautiful Stranger and Deeper and Deeper. Where are the remixes of Don't Cry for me Argentina, or You Must Love Me or the remake of American Pie? The half of the album is full of silly ballads and R&B-scented numbers like the rubbish It's Human Nature, the sleep-inducing (but mean to be a good ballad) Take A Bow which is the same with all Babyface songs, Bedtime Story which is the same as ever with anything Bjork has done in the past and so-so Secret. Frozen seems to be a nice standout but it doesn't feel sincere, and more or less sounds like Power of Goodbye... and the Music album was one of the worst albums Madonna crapped out so singles should not be different.  All in all, Madonna is not a slow number singer; her voice terribly sounds weaker than her dance numbers and that's why this greatest hits album was not successful as Immaculate Collection because the singles were already bad. This album reflects the spiral-down of Madonna through 90s to 2000s (except Ray of Light where she struck gold) where she hit the bottom with American Life and has not recovered herself. Go buy Immaculate Collection, Ray of Light album, down load one or two other songs at your disposal and you will have the good things Madonna has produced among the heap of redundant mass called pop music."
2,"NOTE: I bought this CD a while ago, the tunes were mediocre. Then again I'm probably biased because I don't really like rap a whole lot.   Buuuut, what made me throw away this album you ask?  The guy is a racist, who uses this record as a soap box to talk about how evil white people are, and how they're out to screw him over at every turn. Seriously, listen closely, and I counted at least the first 4 to five tracks are sprinkled with racist lyrics. I despise bigots who may have had one or two bad experiences and then turn around and see fit to spit rhymes about how white people are keeping everyone down. I don't care what race you are, don't be hating on races just because you have a selfish, racist streak in you.    In ""Jesus Walks"" he talks about how we need to defeat racism...well he keeps harking on it. But he won't stop whining. I agree with him, racism does exist and it is a very real problem. However people like him play victim and make millions of dollars off it. I shouldn't have to listen to an album and feel bad about being white, or black, or any other race. Such themes litter the album and take away from its supposed originality.   Additionally, why does he even think that he is worthy to call upon Jesus? The track following ""Jesus Walks"" he talks about getting falacio (I'm trying to be PC, not that it matters). I'm no prude...most of the music i listen is laden with ""foul language"". The guy is a hypocrite to an insane degree.   He raps about the same stuff. And its not different then most other rappers out there. He's really not original at all. Over and over and over again: Look at me I'm important, feel sorry for me. Its like the emo of rap, the Linkin Park of rap.    The guy is a megalomaniac, narcissist, self absorbed racist, and I won't be buying anymore of his music.   SUMMARY: Musically its ok, nothing really orignial. Just Ok if you like rap (a genre I'm still trying to get into). The guy is talented I'll give him that.   Lyrically its a joke. He's a fake. If that stuff matters to you. But if it dosn't, then ignore this review....or ignore it because you don't like my opinion. "
1,"This is a joke right?! I honestly thought this group was a hiphop parody group at first because I figured nobody could be that bad on purpose. These British rappers are hiliarous, they basically talk over a beat and it doesn't even rhyme half the time. I got given this cd for free and I still want some money back"
4,The albulm is a Bomb. It's a must have in the library
4,"this is their forth album,it came out in 1999 when i was 12,my boy aaron kept playin this album and  i got annoyed and i asked him if i could borrow it and he let me hold it and then i can see why he kept playing it,the beats are addicting,this is when mobb deep started to go a lil commercial not too much but they still kept it real,its not ass dark as hell on earth or the infamous but it shouldn't stop you from listenin to this album,this is a good album but its not the same as thir ealry material,also for mobb deep or qb fans y'all should check out the murda muzik movie,it was supposed to come out back in 1999 but kept gettin pushed back,so it finally came out in 2004.recommmended for fans  of mobb deep,qb hip hop,ny hip hop,late 90's hip hop.standout tracks are streets raised me (reminds me of junior high school days when i used to live in ny),what's your poison (featuring cormega,he murdered this track spittin that fire),adrenaline (nice dark organ sample),quiet storm (brings me mad memories),thug muzik(produced by alchemist featuring the infamous mobb),the realest (produced by alchemist featuring kool g rap,one of the illest collabos),usa aight then, it's mine (i used to play this song a lot),and quiet storm (remix featuring lil kim).also mobb deep y'all should bring it back to murda muzik beats wise or hell on earth on your next album"
2,"I was extremely disappointed by this album. It just didn't grab me at all like Fallen did. It has no outstanding tracks or anything much memorable. I guess Nightwish has spoiled me. Before, Evanescence was about the only female-fronted band I cared to listen to. Now that I have discovered Nightwish, Evanescence just seems useless. Sorry, but I just don't care for it"
5,"Buy this CD. The songs are excellent,as per usual. This CD is more rock, with the same enjoyable dispostion... to quote from track 6, Decatur St. ""I'm one of them sad boys who's hypnotized by girl's who walk the walk...""or track 5 The Killer.... ""I want you to burn me til I feel it..."" ... need one say more"
5,"This cd is as cool as they come.  Simply smooth all the way through.  I love every song here.  If you are thinking about getting this cd, stop and go get it.  You'll love it.  Ta ta.."
1,"I had heard a lot about My Chemical Romance, both positive and negative. I decided to pick up a used copy of 'Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge' so I could form my own opinion without the biased input of from jaded indie hipster snobs or 14 year-old spoiled scene kids.  This record was written and marketed to deliver pop songs, and the opener 'Helena' is an outstanding one. It has a great melody that stands up to repeated listening, and the performance is passionate and convincing. The problem is that on every other song on the album, I was bored with the melodies and performances, even after extensive repeated listening [I'm talking about keeping this in my CD player for over 2 months, not just a quick skip-through]. The high-gloss production values suffocate any negligable amount of rocking power and sonic depth that the music might have had, and the juvenile melodrama of the lyrics and melodies gets old real fast when they don't deliver the pop hooks they promise.  This album does not rock. Period"
1,"I am quite dissappointed in this CD, being won over by the sound bytes that I sampled here at Amazon, which are very beautiful. Imagine listening to one of the samples presented here 20 times in a row.  The sample represents the whole of the song, which is repeated over and over and over with a solo over the top.  To me, this signifies a lack of creativity.  There is so much potential in each of these songs, but it is as if Avishai wrote 4 measures and then put a repeat sign at the end to finish the song.  Maybe my expectations were too high, expecting a Billy Childs type of song structure.  I will be looking at selling my CD so I can recoup at least a portion of my investment"
1,"I have listened to this cd, also watched the dvd, of John Fogerty's long road home on amazon. Nothing can compare to his Dvd of Premonition.I own It love it, Put it on and  makes me  rock out, With one of the best entertainers In his prime time of life.The guitars and Instruments he plays is awesome to watch a legend of great talent.His voice Is so excellent & clear.Had some friends over with John's Premonition dvd playing.It took all of us back to that time In history.They all went to amazon and bought Premonition.I know soon they will all be gone.I went back to buy one more the price is so reasonable.As I consider Premonition to be a Collector's dvd.If you see it again.Do not wait buy it while they are available. I know its a Import as most dvds are today.Mine plays excellent In audio and picture.You feel like you are sitting in the audience with John performing.Give Premonition 10 Stars.Anything after John's Premonition dvd can not compare to it.No matter how hard they try to bring back his music on a Cd or a dvd.Premonition Is the best dvd  of all of times. All the rest get 1 Star for trying. Though not coming close to what I call  my Collector's Edition  dvd of John Fogerty's Prmonition. "
4,"This CD was off the chain! From start to finish. The grooves were tight, the lyrics were full of food for thought, and that voice...that VOICE. It's a melting pot of songs from politics, to sexuality, to love, to self consciencness. She spared no one on every subject she covered. My personal favorites are Dead Nigga BLVD./Priorities/Earth/and God.Fear.Money. I didn't like the remix to Pocketbook, it was just too loud for a style like hers. But other than that, this album to me is the best she ever put out. Buy it, it's worth it"
4,"Most singers have to scream from mountaintops to be heard.  Others have to strategically position themselves to be taken seriously.  But Maysa Leak, vocalist of the underexposed Incognito, has a grace that oozes so effortlessly, that her peers must be scrambling to wonder how she's able to do it.  Her solo debut isn't going to make anyone forget about Incognito, but it's a solid album that shows that she's able to stand on her own.  The disc is a mix of jazz-laced soul that never makes leaps and bounds to make a statement (heads up, Alicia Keyes) and doesn't stray too far from her past work with Incognito. Like a kite on a windy October afternoon, it soars with ease.  Favorte tracks of mine are &quot;Black Heaven,&quot; &quot;Can We Change the World?,&quot; and &quot;Peace of Mind.&quot;  Maybe, one day, the mainstream will catch up with Maysa and find out what it has been missing for all these years"
5,"I met JV, Loki and Germs when they started Gotham Road and 2 yrs ago.  And we have been friends since.  So I wanted to check out their earlier stuff.  I like it, now I gotta check out the rest of their early stuff.  The singer J-sin at times sounds like Iggy!  Check them out!  and if you really want some good stuff then check out Gotham Road - Seasons of the Witch demo"
2,"Stick with Blitzkid because they can sing ten times better than this guy. He is also in Blitzkid actually and he plays drums...where he belongs. The songs on this cd are very well written and played, its just a shame that the singing is so forced and cheesy. I mean I know this is supposed to be 50's style doo-wop rock, but please. Better things in the genre....like Blitzkid"
5,"Faith Hill's latest CD 'Fireflies' is wonderful, not necessarily because of her choice in songs, but because of her beautiful voice.  I have been a fan of Faith's since the beginning and I must say her music doesn't disappoint.  While the songs are not as strong as say the songs on 'Faith', they are still quite good, particularly the songs written by Lori McKenna.  After hearing Faith sing her songs, I went out and bought Lori's album 'Bittertown', which is quite simply an incredible album.  On 'Fireflies' Faith masters each song and brings such a beautiful interpretation to each song.  Songs that I particularly enjoy are ""Stealing Kisses"", ""I Want You"", ""Paris"" and ""Mississippi Girl"".  I've read other reviews that said 'Fireflies' left them confused.  The album's songs do lack cohesiveness at times, but overall the album is still a must-have if only because of Faith's voice.  She has, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful and pure voices in music"
1,"This CD is too wack to have so many songs. J Lo should've just kept it below five. Her voice is thin, tasteless, and watery like powdered milk at the end of the month."
2,"Your music goes back to sucking.   Steve Earle didn't talk much about Car Wheels in his autobiography other than to say working with Lucinda was a real drag. Well, whatever. Obviously it produced incredible results and no matter how difficult she is they should look into working together again. Because frankly, w/o Earle, Lucinda Williams writes fairly boring songs and puts them to even more boring arrangements. And without Lucinda, Steve Earle does fairly generic country that is rarely worth a second listen. Together, they're awe inspiring.  Anyway, on to Essence: boring songs+boring arrangments+drugged-out singing=bad album. Trying to pimp the tracks up with production pixie dust doesn't fix the fundamental problem here: the songs are lame. In place of insight we get shopping lists, in place of hooks we get verse, verse, verse. And in place of emotion we get slurred vocals.   Such ingredients do not make for a good record.   as a side note, if you filter by ""most helpful"" you get reviewers who aren't 5-star fanboy clones and write intelligent reviews. Most of them were not fooled by this album, no matter how big a fan of Lucinda they are.  RstJ"
2,I was just overall very dissapointed.  I tried to make myself listen to this album but I could only do so a couple times before I gave up.  I thoroughly enjoy hip hop but much prefer Kool Keith or MF Doom or Gang Starr or other slightly less than mainstream artists
2,"Although I consider ""Too Much Time On My Hands"" a guilty pleasure, Styx is to rock music as Pee Wee Herman is to pro wrestling.  Many years ago, I had a guy working for me who had been a roadie for Styx in his younger days. He told the story of the night the entire roadie crew walked off the job -- they just couldn't stand to listen to the ""music"" anymore. What else is there to say"
5,"I first heard Joe Carson back in the early -70's while going through some of my folks' 78's.  At first, I thought it was Webb Pierce (on one of his best days);  then I distinctly heard Hank;  on the other hand, there was the sound of Ray Price (his Cherokee Cowboy Days).  All of these sounds came from a young kid (16 when he started performing) who should have, by every right, been the most heralded Country/Hillbilly/Honky Tonkin' singer ever; and yes, that includes even the great Hank Williams.  But, Joe Carson's life was cut short just as he was hitting his stride.  If there was a way to rate this collection higher than 5 stars, I would not hesitate to do so.  As with all of the Bear Family Records releases, this one is an outstanding collection, beautifully recorded and mixed, and a thorough set of liner notes/booklet.  Not only does this album showcase the stellar voice of Joe, the backing band (all legendary members of the Hank Thompson era) will knock your socks off.  While there are 33 songs here (3X more than most current releases), there are a few real standouts:  ""I Gotta Get Drunk"", ""The Last Song I'll Ever Sing"", and ""Shoot The Buffalo"" all showcase his voice.  And, there are a few old favorites here as well, inlcuding ""Fraulein"" and ""Who'll buy the Wine"".  This is one of those albums you have to own;  and I can assure you, you'll be shaking your head in amazement at Joe Carson's talent. A+++"
5,"Blue Rodeo, out of Canada where they are rightfully GODS, continues to fly under the US radar...what a shame, especially when one stacks Blue Rodeo against lesser talents. ""5 Days In July"" is the gemstone of this richly talented group. Combining elements of The Eagles, The Byrds, Poco, The Flying Burrito Brothers,twinges of psychedellic memories, 60's style chord work *which comes off VERY nice* and at times, vocal harmonies which bring a sweet hint of The Everly Brothers, this group, which can rock with the best or slow it down to a nice mellow, has a sound of their own. At once, the lyrics are memorable and catchy. The vocalists, Cuddy and Keelor, each bring their own qualities which never grow old with Cuddy having impressive range while Keelor brings at times, a nice raspiness with a clever edge. ""Bad Timing"", one of the great tunes off this gem, would soar on the country charts if given a chance. With the exception of ""Til I Gain Control Again"" *brilliantly covered earlier by Crsytal Gayle and later by Willie Nelson*, all the tunes are penned by Cuddy and Keelor, as are their efforts on other Blue Rodeo albums. I had the great pleasure to see/hear this remarkable group at The Ramshead Tavern in Annapolis, Maryland. They DID NOT disappoint. If you're looking for GREAT music outside the usual stuff played endlessly on formatted radio, this is a MUST! I would also suggest their DVD, ""Burning Snowmen"", which chronicles them over time. If you can, find a way to one of their concerts.."
5,"Flaming Lips have suceeded in creating their own musical world on ""The Soft Bulletin"". This cd is easy to find at most stores and often sold at a low price, so there is no real reason why you can't go pick it up right now. This record is best heard at 3 am with headphones on. Yoshimi was my first lips record, and the main difference between ""Soft Bulletin"" and ""Yoshimi"" is the production values. This recording has a big lo-fi sensibility to it. Steven's drums are always loud, boomy, and usually crackling, like they recorded way too hot. At times the record seems overloaded with sounds, and at first, I thought it would have benifited from the more prestine ""Yoshimi"" production values. It has grown on me though. I don't really understand the point of having ""Race for the Prize"" and  ""Waiting for Superman"" (the weakest track on the album) in two seperate versions. To me the record would have ended perfectly on ""Sleeping on the Roof""."
5,"Great, Cd I love it, Kelly and Lee Ryan could make a great duet,this is one of my best CD's, It's awsome, I love all the song, great job Kell"
2,"If you're like me, you got into Boo Radleys during the shoegazer era.  I loved the discs preceding Wake Up!, especially Giant Steps.  This is as far away from shoegazer as you can get.  The first reviewer here is right on as now Carr is totally doing the Beach Boys sunny harmony thing.  Sorry, no my thing.  They could have evolved more like Catherine Wheel whom I recommend highly.  Also try Ride (of course) and Slowdive"
5,"Most of Em's fans think that The Marshall Mathers LP is his best work but I beg to differ. The Eminem Show is his greatest album for many reasons. 1-He handled all the production except 3 songs (""Business"", ""Say What U Say"", & ""My Dad's Gone Crazy"") all of which was produced by the great Dr. Dre, 2-he kept all guest appearances to a minimum, 3-his flow improved greatly. The best song has to be ""Square Dance"", a song that show how well he rides the beat with ease. Let's hope Em can put out another album that can match the intensity of The Eminem Show.  Top 5 Songs 1. Square Dance 2. Say What U Say f/ Dr. Dre 3. Say Goodbye Hollywood 4. When The Music Stops f/ D12 5. Til I Collapse f/ Nate Dog"
2,"I read in Manson's bio that the singer for this band was a groupie of his. And it shows. This cd is a clean, more innocent version of Manson's first cd.   Her voice is nice and catchy, but the content wont appeal to many peole over the age of 16. This was a cd that was made to get quick appeal and then fade away just as fast"
5,Wow!  Great quartets played with real gusto and dynamism by the Prager String Quartet.  The sound is incredibly crisp and clear.  The performances are impeccable.  You won't be disappointed
5,"The series of ""Golden Age of American Rock & Roll"" released by ACE couldn't have a better end. During the past 15 years they have delighted us with a series of 10 CD's with 30 songs each remembering the Rock & Roll era mostly with minor top hits between 1954 and 1963. One reason for their tremendous success is the superb quality of all the recordings no matter from what year the original song was. Now besides these series of 10 CD's from the R&R era they have launched another 2 special editions with the same title: one with the special novelty edition and another with the special country edition. Both deserve more than 5 stars.  The song selection on the novelty edition is just out of sight! Most of the songs brought back memories from a long long time ago since these weren't available after the time they were top hits. I never found them back on what compilation so ever until ACE put them all together 45 years later. And with a sound quality better than in their original version on 45rpm. Therefore don't hesitate. Buy it together with the country edition and you will have 60 songs for utmost pleasure; 60 songs we grew up with and now with no scratches on them.  "
5,"If they had an unlimited number of stars, there wouldn't be enough room for all mine! This is a great CD with nearly ALL of my favorite Toby Keith songs! They're all super, but my favorites are I WANNA TALK ABOUT ME, THE ANGRY AMERICAN (I love that song!), BEER FOR MY HORSES (love that song next!), YOU AIN'T MUCH FUN, and SHOULD'VE BEEN A COWBOY.   Toby Keith has such a great voice! And he isn't a liberal either, might I add. (Warning: If you're a Dixie Chicks fan, you're going to hate this CD.)   Great buckle on his belt on the cover picture of the CD"
5,"One thing I love about Deitrick, besides being annointed and a great singer, is that he stick with the themes of his albums names whether it be crossroads, or lost and found every song reflects what a person maybe going through in those stages. Nonetheless, Crossroads is a classic gospel album from start to finish. It should have gone a trillion times platinum, but hey he will get his recognition in due time. Amen to that. Ok, 7 days is mainly a celebration ablum, after all God did create everything in 7 days and that is something to celebrate about, with hot and funky beats that will have you dancing all over the place. Don't get me wrong the album does have traditional church songs and content but its a bit more funkier. Just imagine ""God is Good"" mixed with ""Unity"" mixed with ""God didn't give up on me"" through a whole album. This is the best way to explain it. Deitrick my friend, you are my favorite Gospel artist and truely annointed. I thank God for you everyday, Amen to that. Thank you Deitrick for obeying the Lords will to make wonderful music and most of all I thank God for creating you to make this wonderful music. All Glory is yours Jesus! Amen and Amen. Go and Get it!"
5,"I am not a fan of the Carpenters but when I was younger (25 years ago) I knew a lot of their songs but considered my self a ""rock and roller"" without a decent gear to listen to.  With good equipment on hand now and collecting albums of my youth in SACD format, I decided to buy this one and was surprised that the remastering was one of the best I have heard.  I am a stereo only person because I do not find the hometheater enjoyable.  I tried it for 5 years (from 1991) but did not get the satisfaction I have now with my stereo equipment.  My equipment has high end sound with a medium high end price.  To this day, I have yet to hear a system better sounding than mine  (Yes I am biased!).  High end does not mean excellent sound because I tried to listen to well known brands and I could not get satisfied with the sound.  I believe the key to good sounds are the amplifier  specs that only two manufacturers still specify. Slew rate and damping factor.  One is Australian and the other Swiss.  I have the Australian brand to beat.  Speakers  and interconnects are secondary but to me, electrostatic speakers are king! SACD players that are mid range suffice"
4,"Just a bit less evolved.  The songs on this album are absolutely brilliant.  With a wide range of styles, there's something on this album for everyone - only the songs You and I and You've Got It Bad Girl are anything less than fantastic, in fact.  You Are The Sunshine Of My Life - very good, original song.  Not his best, but still good. Maybe Your Baby - an awesome groove, nice synth bass, but maybe it goes on a bit too long. You And I - not a bad ballad, nowhere near as good as Blame It On The Sun, but has its own charm. Tuesday Heartbreak - very joyful sounding song.  Good tension between the verses and chorus, great melodies throughout, and excellent drums. You've Got It Bad Girl - a bit jazzy experimental.  Not bad. Superstition - Good dance tune, very funky, with a powerful horn riff that Peter Gabriel would later rip off in 'Sledgehammer'. Big Brother - awesome clavinet tune, angry lyrics, nice melody. Blame It On The Sun - this is one of the best ballads, written, ever!  Really.  He does this kind of ballad on every album, but this is the best of them, with a soaring (or wailing) verse that slides into an emotional chorus. Lookin' For Another Pure Love - very original music, freestyle melody. I Believe (When I Fall In Love It Will Be Forever) - this is a real triumph, this is everything a song should be, with an awesome chorus that repeats 10 times at the end and you're not getting tired of it."
5,"Just by saying this has been quite a year for the veteran crooner would be an understatement in itself. Barry Manilow began 2006 with the predecessor to this time capsule by debuting at #1 last February with The Greatest Songs Of The Fifties. In between that album release and this, he has continued to sell out his Las Vegas extravaganza, Music and Passion, five nights a week. The show is so successful that the Las Vegas Hilton recently extended Manilow's contract through 2008. He picked up his second Emmy Award this past August for the live on tape broadcast of that event, and with the release of this album, he has his highest-selling tally in a debut week than he has for any other album of his 32 year recording career. Barry also holds the distinction of being the only artist of 2006 to have two Top two records in Billboard in one calendar year. When it came to recording his follow-up to the ""Fifties,"" juggernaut, it didn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what the concept would be. All it took was Clive Davis to help sort out the material and all systems were go. For the critics who have tarred and feathered Manilow since he hit #1 with his very first single, ""Mandy"" over three decades ago, you'd think by this time they'd cut him some slack. No dice. Manilow has even admitted he wouldn't know how to react if he heard a kind word from a critic, the Brooklyn-born writer, arranger, producer and crooner has always depended on the devotion of his fanbase. And it's not just any fanbase. These people are hardcore fans, dubbed ""Fanilows."" On this CD, we are treated to thirteen chestnuts that made the 60's one of the best eras in pop music history. The pop songs run the gamut of that decade offering everything from Bacharach to the Beatles and in between honest and original covers that include a sensational retooling of Frankie Valli's ""Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You,"" which kicks the disc off into high gear. Other highlights among highlights include a duet with 60's supergroup, The Association, on their staples ""Cherish"" and ""Windy"" that Barry cleverly arranged as a medley. Elvis' gorgeous 1962 ballad ""Can't Help Falling In Love"" is lusciously delivered as is The Righteous Brothers 1965 anthem ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'."" Even the somewhat hokey #1 Dean Martin single ""Everybody Loves Somebody"" from 1964 fits in divinely as Manilow gives it as much warmth as Dino did over forty years ago. Sinatra's smash hit from 1966, ""Strangers In The Night"" is so effective, Franks' daughter, Tina, gave Manilow a thumbs-up for a sensational interpretation. Other pop staples included are the Herman's Hermits ""There's A Kind Of Hush,"" Bacahrach's gorgeous song from '68 ""This Guy's In Love With You,  as well as his '69 Oscar-winner ""Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head."" The Beatles shimmering 1964 ballad ""And I Love Her"" and Bobby Vinton's 1963 ""Blue Velvet"" is just as haunting as the original while the mood on the 1962 love anthem ""When I Fall In Love"" originally a hit for The Lettermen is optimistically heart-wrenching. The album ends on a positive note (pun intended) with the 1965 anthem for hope ""What The World Needs Now Is Love."" Never was that sentiment so true - never was a Manilow album this gratifying. Everything from song selections to Manilow's masterful arrangements to his honest readings, this record is easily ranked as one of the best of his storied career. Look for The Greatest Songs Of The Seventies inside a year. It doesn't take a fortune teller to figure that one out"
1,What a total hack.  Do people really think this guy has talent?  He is ruining the genre!  Stupid me bought the CD because it seemed to be everywhere...big mistake.  AVOID
1,I dont see what people like about this CD. My 14 month old son and I looked at each other in disgust when I first played it!!! Very irritaing CD dont buy it!!! I am returning it today.
5,"A great collection of Arts solo stuff, which include his 2 brillant chart no one`s &quot;I Only Have Eyes For You&quot; &amp; &quot;Bright Eyes.&quot; There is quite a few songs off &quot;The Art Garfunkel  Album&quot; such as the romantic &quot;I Believe When I Fall In Love It`ll  Be For Ever&quot;  &amp; &quot;99 Miles From L.A.&quot;   &quot;Watermark&quot; from the album from the same name. But surprisingly  only  a a couple of tracks, from the very well put together album  &quot;Fate For Breakfast.&quot; All in all it`s a great album, with a   great selection of songs. So if you like chill out tunes, after a stressful  day, buy this album. I can guantee, it will de-stress you"
5,"I first got Believe It as a used record in the late 70's. Wow! This CD includes 2 rather short LPs, but you are getting it for the first one - Believe It! which was the single best hard-fusion record ever made. It's also a great bridge from the world of rockers dabbling in jazz (Bruford's early band, Brand X, etc.) to a real jazz outfit that happens to rock hard. I never tire of listening to this one with it's wonderful blend of Tony's great drumming, some of the best guitar work Holdsworth has ever done and just enough funk to keep it from ever getting too serious. Buy it and crank it up"
1,"This is PT worst album made. Every track on this album is bad! Lame lyrics, awful beats and there in no decent guests on this album. Murda man was a awful diss track to Lil Jon, PT has lost his game thats all. Also I wanna why PT has the beef with lil jon anyway. If you want so good albums get Trill by Bun B, Ghetto Bill Gates by Master P."
2,"I remember that just before I bought this in 1993 I was pretty fed up with the state of Guitar Playing. At the time, the gloom and doom of the latest wave had settled over the world of guitar playing like a rain cloud. This guy turned it all around for me.  I have seen and heard some of the greatest guitar players more than once but what Danny did on this album is mind boggling. The thing is, it is pure, honest, beautiful, mean, technically impressive, music. Just a box of ear candy.  If you appreciate a good guitar player than you are in for a treat. There has never been anybody whom I recommended this album to that was disappointed. "
2,"This is definitely one of the worst cd purchases i've made.  The Cd is poorly organized, and most of the music isn't as good as one would think.  the songs that ARE worth listening to though, are: Disc 1: 8. Halifax - ""sydney"" 11. Say Anything - ""Woe"" 15. I can make a mess like nobody's business - ""The best happiness money can buy"" 56. Patent Pending - ""Los Angeles""  Disc 2: 1. Hellogoodbye - ""Homewrecker"" 5. Jack's Mannequin - ""Kill the messenger"" 8. Matchbook Romance - ""My Eyes Burn""  Other than that, this is really a minimal value Cd, in my opinion"
5,"This is a must-have CD for any parent who likes introducing the simple joys of great music to their kids.  My mom and dad (both in their late sixties) enjoy listening, too, and my child can ask her grandmother about other songs from ""back in the day.""    Get the book, too!  Nicky's really big personality shines through as he rubs elbows, er-paws, with some jazz heavy-hitters.  Your child will love the photos and will also discover some great new vocabulary words like bop-a-re-bop. The CD and book have proven to be a great gift combo.    Take a listen and enjoy! "
4,"After his successful debut, Ja Rule didn't take no time whipping up his second album.  ""Rule 3:36"" spawned the hit singles, ""Between Me and You"" and ""Put It on Me.""  It was released in Fall of 2000.  Can Ja do it again and release another very solid effort or will he fall to the sophomore curse?  1. Intro - No Rating  2. Watching Me - Very Short - 4.5/5  3. Between Me and You (Featuring Christina Milian) - 4/5  4. Put It on Me (Featuring Vita) - 3.5/5  5. 6 Feet Underground - 4/5  6. Love Me, Hate Me - 3.5/5  7. Die (Featuring Caddillac Tah, Black Child & Dave Bing) - 4.5/5  8. F*** You (Featuring O-1 & Vita) - 4.5/5  9. I'll F*** U Girl (Skit) - No Rating  10. Grey Box (Skit) - No Rating  11. E***** (Featuring Caddillac Tah, Black Child & Jayo Felony) - 3.5/5  12. It's Your Life (Featuring Shade Sheist) - 4/5  13. I Cry (Featuring Lil' Mo) - 3.5/5  14. One of Us - 5/5  15. Chris Black (Skit) - No Rating  16. The Rule Won't Die - Very Short - 3/5  47.5/60  3.5 Stars  Wow I can't believe my ears, Ja Rule sold out big time!  He almost dropped his whole street style completely and pretty much filled this album with all commercialized pop-rap music.  Some of it is good no doubt but this isn't an album you can bump and nod your head to.  Good for a couple listens then probably never again.  Mannn Ja what happened to you"
2,"A lot of people are meriting Ja's credibility on all his albums because he has been able to keep his voice on the airwaves since 1998. So he released his sophomore album Rule 3:36 in Sept 2000, that is one of the worst Ja albums I've heard (not the worst, The Last Temptation takes that title).   Ja tries to be ""gangstafied"" on this album but fails terribly. Starting with the first single ""Me & You"" thinking his thug style can attract women. I haven't bought the concept in 2000, and I'm still not buying it six years later. Or how about the flat falling track ""F*** You"" featuring Vita and 01?  Or as many revewers have pointed out that he tries to boast his singing vocals on this album, which seriously damages his creditablity. How about the song ""Put It On Me"" before Lil Mo joined song. Sounds wack(er) with out her. Or how about the late Barry White imitation on the song ""Extacy"" (and thats one of the decent tracks on this album). Oh and remember when ""Between Me & You"" was highly antacipated that you downloaded the single on Napster? Well do you remember that the origonal/demo that some of you downloaded didn't have Christina Millian singing the hook, but had Ja singing it himself. Thank god that wasn't on the album.    Now there are some listenable tracks on this album that I would like to point out. ""6 Feet"" is a standout track, and is possibly the best track on this album and my personal favorite. ""Watching Me"" is another tight track, as Ja spits with a load of energy within him. ""I Cry"" and as mentioned earlier ""Extacy"" are decent at best. Other than that, most of the tracks on this album are skippable.  Overall, a sub medicore Ja Rule album. Most of the 4 and 5 star reviewers are either big time Ja Rule fans or just in love with mainstream overrated rap (""Put It On Me"" [Remix]). To me, this album is nothing else but a pop rap, falsafied thug rap album that just doesn't appeal to me. I recommend this to hardcore Ja Rule fans if they don't have this already.  Lyrics: C Production: C+ Guest Appearances: C- Musical Vibes: D-  Favorite Tracks: Watching Me, 6 Feet, Die, Extacy  Honorable Mention Track : Chris Black (skit"
5,"The songs on this album are outstanding, the writing is direct, the themes are the same ones Neil has always sung about, making relationships last over time, country living, the road.  But the way this album was recorded is probably the main reason I keep coming back.  Obviously the guitars are all melting and the amps are overdriven and the songs are free-form, but the vocals are right where I want them, and the guitars are so warm that the album never agitates me (and believe me, I've listened to some agitating music - Teengenerate anyone?).  I guess the fifth star is gained by the fact that the songs and the band are still more important than the medium, this album isn't noteworthy for its use of feedback and hot guitars, but because everything fits, in a smooth and soulful way.  Never gimmick.  Always authentic.  Neil transcends the genre again"
2,"I am originally from The Land of Ten Thousand Lakes myself (and there's a hell of a lot more than ten thousand lakes, by the way).  I am also a musician, singer, and writer of a ""country roots"" perspective (who now lives 40 min. outside NYC), who understands how crappy the business can be.   My biggest complaint about Rockie, my fellow Minnesotan, is simply this:  He and his music don't sound like they come from Minnesota, nor Carolina (his birthplace, am I correct?), and lotsa' good country music comes from these two regions.  I mean, this record is produced well and sounds generally good, but he sounds like someone who is taking the advice of all the jackasses from Nashville who say, ""Ya' gotta' sound like this and look like this; 'cause that's what works down here, plain and simple!""    Well, I think that theory is gonna' die sooner than later.  You gots guys like Djerks Bently and Eric Church who are still not exactly where country needs to be, but they are making a slight dent in the ""soccer-momming"" of country music.    Wanna' hear good country music?  Check out 10 City Run!  They are what CMT should be airing, and they are getting airplay on ""Wide Open Country"" (seriously, check out this band, and my review of them--10 City Run--for they're the real frickin' deal).   So Rockie, my friendly advice would be this: drop the affected, mainstream, country radio accent (don't replace it with a hard-core Minnesota accent, however--Fargoooo--no good), get a band that plays more than one kind of country music, and draw on the great history of music that has come from Minnesota (Jayhawks, Replacements, even Marvin Rainwater, oh, and that Bob Dylan-dude) and Carolina (too many influences to even start!) 'cause that's you, man! That's where you're from! That's how you'll sound genuine (as the one reviewer noticed how at times you seemed to be trying too hard, other times, not hard enough)!  My theory: Your hearts not in it!    You have tremendous talent and I'm pulling for you, the next album, and the Vikings--the last, more reluctantly each year.    God Speed,  Bryan  SW Connecticut "
2,Another reviewer has stated that Mark often.It's good songs.Small package.Bring home some milk ok?It gets out stains too
1,"I love The Foundations who made a lot of great music in the sixties. Of course everyone has heard ""Baby Now That I've Found You"" and ""Build Me Up Buttercup"", but they had so many great songs. I had a ten inch compilation from the early'80's with about ten songs, all of which are on this disc. They would've fit in very well with a lot of the Motown groups, although they were a multi-racial English band. I mistakenly gave this recording one star when I intended five."
2,"Like fingernails on a blackboard - the instruments, the singer's voice, the melodies"
5,"I was lucky enough to see this show three times:  twice on the Northwestern University Campus (original musical title was ""a long gay book,"") and a third time at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago.  This show is stunning.  I found myself humming melodies from the show - even though I hadn't seen it in over a year (and didn't own the recording)!  The music and lyrics have a way of staying with you.  This is a real work of art - poetry and song, based on the work of Gertrude Stein.    If you're a fan of musicals with soul, wit, and class, then you'll love this.  The voices of Christine Mild and Jenny Powers (Little Women) are extraordinary and Cindy Gold's narration is engaging and uniquely powerful.  Combine these talents with that of Frank Galati (Tony Award Winner ... Director, Adapted Script) and Stephen Flaherty (Ragtime, etc.) and you have one AMAZING musical.    Highly Recommended!!!"
1,"Get it,Buy it and own it before they do.Also you won't mind if I said this,Right?Um.. I don't think you guys should buy this album because it's not really good.I think it would be very weird if you did anyway.I don't wanna buy this album because it's really comparing the songs from disneymania1,2&3.That's why I give it one star."
1,"I really enjoy the great synthesizer sound (usually this phrase would be an oxymoron) of this film.  John Carpenter is definitely a multi-talented artist (writer, director, composer).  So, I am not in any way criticizing the music itself.  My gripe is against this particular CD release.  I was expecting to receive a CD with only the music.  Unfortunately, very few of these tracks are music only.  Most of them are music accompanied by dialogue from the movie.  If this only happened once or twice, I wouldn't mind so much.  But it's nearly every single track.  Would you buy the STAR WARS soundtrack if it had a whole bunch of dialogue on the tracks?  How about THE GODFATHER, LORD OF THE RINGS, GLADIATOR, or any other great motion picture soundtrack?  If people want the dialogue, then they will surely buy the DVD.  But most people buy a soundtrack for the sole purpose of having the music only"
2,"You have sent an e-mail inviting me to give my opinion on this item.I am sorry I cannot go over 2 stars as unfortunately there is a defect on last track of the record, precisely on the song  ""The last Rose of Summer"".Anyhow I intend to buy other Deanna Durbin's records as I enjoy very much her voice, but unfortunately the wallet is empty now. Thanks for all your help on trying to find ""Shane: a Tribute to Victor Young""but no euccess. I will try to buy another item later.   "
5,"Jefferson Airplane tried hard, on this 1967 utterly noncommercial followup to their phenomenally successful classic SURREALISTIC PILLOW. Having made RCA millions of dollars with PILLOW, the Airplane took full advantage of their newly-minted blank check to create what may be the purest example of musical psychedelia to come out of the Sixties.  Listening to AFTER BATHING AT BAXTER'S is literally a trip. Bizarrely torqued lyrics are wedded to experimental recording techniques, sound montages, and off-center tempos and rhythms to provide the listener with an auditory hallucination. Everything goes, and so it went at BAXTER'S. It was all new, avant-garde to excess, and it largely failed to reach its fullest potential.   Most art does fail, but there's no question that BAXTER'S cross-pollinated with many other performers and musical styles. The influence of BAXTER'S can be heard in ""Revolution 9"" by The Beatles, and on many other recordings of the era. BAXTER'S may have sold poorly, but it was heard by the Airplane's contemporaries, and it clearly served as a wellspring of inspiration. An aficionado's album, AFTER BATHING AT BAXTER'S is a ghost in the machine that remains haunting even today.   "
1,"How fast can you say m-i-s-t-a-k-e? Rimes, the adolescent singing sensation, covering Joplin's ""Me and Bobby McGee?"" Patsy's ""Crazy"" and ""I Fall to Pieces?"" Buck's ""Cryin' Time?"" Cryin' time indeed"
5,"If you like Nickelback and Theory of a Deadman, you are in for a treat. This group rocks! Where Nickelback's Chad punches out his lines (most excellent), Puddle of Mudd is very melodious and has a great all-round sound going. This album is absolutely their best work to date and I am excited to hear some new tunes from this awesome band. Keep 'em coming! :"
4,"You can certainly see where the band should go.  It's a powerful album in some senses, but overall, it's just good.  Pick it up, understanding that it's just good rock/grunge/whatever.  Enjoy. "
2,"I didn't like this album that much. Only songs i liked are The MC, Step Into A World, A Friend, Can't Stop Won't Stop. Just To Prove A Point song was horrible and i don't know why he tried to do a rock song. Putting Puff Daddy on the Step Into A World remix was a terrible decision by KRS. The songs were too short on this album also."
5,"This album took me awhile to get into, but it really is fantastic.  None of the songs have lyrics, it's all about the electric guitar.  Some of the songs jam, and some are more mellow, beautiful peices.  There are a couple duds that I never listen to (namely, ""Trundrumbalind"" and ""Raspberry Delta Jam-V"", and ""Up In The Sky"" I also usually skip), but the rest of the songs are fantastic.  ""Train Of Angels"" is the best of the bunch, along with ""Love Thing"" (gorgeous).  ""Time"" is also a fantastic, dreamy track, ""A Piece Of Liquid"" is relaxing and sounds like something you'd listen to in the caribbean before it goes into some cool ""night-time-sounding"" soloing.  It's impossible not to tap your feet during ""Psycho Monkey"" or ""House Full Of Bullets"",and I love the awesome playing at 1:40 in ""Secret Prayer"".  ""With Jupiter In Mind"" and ""Crystal Planet"" are great space-themed rockers, and ""Lights Of Heaven"" is one of Joe's best.   If you only buy ONE Satriani album, I first and formost recommend The Electric Anthology and Surfing With The Alien, but then I also recommend you pick up Crystal Planet, and Time Machine (not the most consistent album, but there are some here that you simply can't miss)"
5,Just like Perry Como..Doris Day does the same her Christmas songs take me back in time.. And I searched for this Album on the internet the best price was Amazon        Thank you agai
2,"What's worse than a bad cd?  ""The Burdens of Being Upright.""  I don't even know where to start.  I bought it because I really liked the first song ""Mother Mother"" (which is the only reason why Tracy Bonham even gets 2 stars from me)... and I was completely disappointed with the rest of the album.  The songs aren't interesting and the whole thing all in all is just simply not worth the money.  Unless its used and only costs like, two bucks.  Actually, when I went to to trade it in at the record store, they only offered me 25 cents for it because they have so many copies of it and nobody wants them.  And I took the quarter! If you like grunge music, there's a chance that you might like this, but you most likely still won't"
5,"I also do not understand the negative reaction to this album.  Fine, its not what many expected...its better!  Saddoes, get over it...this the Best Album Of 2006.  Their sound has matured and if its not your style move on, don't pan it.."
2,"I didn't like this album that much. Only songs i liked are The MC, Step Into A World, A Friend, Can't Stop Won't Stop. Just To Prove A Point song was horrible and i don't know why he tried to do a rock song. Putting Puff Daddy on the Step Into A World remix was a terrible decision by KRS. The songs were too short on this album also."
2,wow. i've never really been a fan but i respect their lead guitarist.He's done alot of great work... but damn this cd ain't even catchy one bit.  you can hear the pitch fixer on benji's voice throughout the entire cd... it's bad. like realllllly bad. and it's way over produced..
5,"As a devoted Jigga fan, this album was everything and above what I expected. Every track from beginning to last consist of stellar production with complex rhymes. Jay shows off his wide array skills and versatillity with backshots at Nas(Takeover), radio cuts(I.Z.Z.O), emotional wordplay(Song Cry). Highlights include ""Girls, Girls, Girls"", ""Never Change"", and is topped off with ""Renegade"" which in my opinion CONTAINS HIP-HOP'S GREATEST VERSE OF THE PAST 10 YEARS by Eminem. Even the bonus tracks would be leads for the next rapper. Jay has been called commercial, but who ever says that ain't listening."
5,This CD captures the experience of a live performance with Elvis.You realize again what a unique voice Elvis possessed and how much you miss him. I liked the CD and recommend it to Elvis fans
1,"Raven on her own is sophisticated, but cheetah girls is for little girls - cheezy! As are most of these tracks not by real artists with CDs, just kids stuck together. 2 of Jesse Mccartney's worst songs - sorry! Some Chisty C. Romano tracks. ""anyone but me"" is a gem, get her EP instead. Hayden's ""My Hero..."" is great also, this girl can sing! She's also on the Ice Princess Sndtrck (""I Fly"")which i recommend in addition to ""Go Figure"" If they let her, she has a huge future"
5,I was given this cd as a gift for my newborn daughter and it is wonderful!  I am buying it again because it is starting to skip I have played it so much.  It doesn't get old and I even enjoy falling asleep to it while I am listening to the baby monitor
2,"Mack 10 couldn't do it twice.  His first album is tight, but this one  lacks good beats.  Also, his rapping style is too lame to carry the off  beats.  The only way could have saved the album is if he would have had  alot of guest rappers and producers"
5,"This album contains the Classic Rock song ""Smokin' In The Boy's Room"" which a lot of my peers did back in High School.Back then they used to smoke filter cigarettes. Sadly these days the filter cigarettes have now been replaced with a more potent addictive drug. Anyway back to the album. The guitarist and singer of this band Cub Koda was a Wild Man of Rock who was always great to watch in action as he jumped from one place to another on stage. They don't make them like him anymore. This album ROCKS so play it LOUD and forget about the neighbours!!!"
1,"I wish I had never owned the original recording of this album because THIS ""version"" is a sorry compilation disc distributed by BMG/Sony that hardly compares to the original. If you can find the original, get THAT, for this compilation disc does not contain some of the selections and suffers greatly for it"
5,"The best country music Christmas CD I have ever heard.  I have always been a fan of Randy Travis.  During Christmas, this CD is continously being played on my stereo.  I would recommend this album to anybody who likes  Christmas music not just Randy Travis fans"
5,"I heard this CD when I was watching an indoor track meet. One of my dad's runners showed me the CD and I listened to it. My Mom bought it for me back in 1997 as one of the first CDs I ever had. It is probably the best classical music CD I have ever owned or to which I have listened. If you run cross country or track this CD is a must as it gets you going gradually, especially the song ""Titles."" A must CD for runners and anyone else who likes nice classical background music."
5,"We've been listening to this one every night for 16months, and we still love it.  The music is beautiful, not cloying or sweet.  And maybe it's just because we don't understand the lyrics, but it doesnt' get tiresome or seem condescending like so much children's music does. Not every song is a winner - there's one that's slightly annoying -- but basically, this is music I'd listen to even if I didn't have twins. Plus, as soon as it goes on my kids start nodding off.  Maybe it's just a Pavlovian response, but hey, whatever works"
5,"This is what punk is all about. Fast music, ripping bass solos, and good ... lyrics. The casualties is what hardcore punk is all about. I highly recomend this to any hardcore punk fa"
5,"great album, super tracks and nothing more you can ask for, just simply amazing album! i highly reccomend it! SCOOTER 4ever"
2,"Steve Martin has become a cultural staple in the comic community.  With hysterical films and outlandish Saturday Night Live performances, it would be obvious that Martin would be a great choice to do a comic album.  Well, in this film guys opinion, you are going to need to be a big fan of Martin to stomach this album.  His humor is offbeat, never quite following a pattern or direction.  Instead of actual jokes, he resorts to making noises on the album that I am sure are funny in person, but listening to it just comes off a failure.  His ""Cat Handcuffs"" bit is humorous, but the rest becomes obvious that somebody was looking to cash in on Martin's popularity.  I would have loved to see Steve Martin in concert during his younger days, I am sure that he would make me laugh my socks off, but it just doesn't translate well to day's style.  I am sorry Steve, but I liked your other album better.  Grade: ** out of ****"
1,"YAAAAAAAAWWWWWWNNN! Don't even bother buying and listening to this CD. Every song on here lacks emotion, meaningful lyrics, and any type of memorable melody. Standards are set so low that any untalented fool can get a record deal, sample to their hearts content, and win a Grammy. Skip this and get Stevie Wonders greatest hits collection"
2,I saw Draco on a tv show and I liked the song he played so I read some reviews looking for a CD and I ended up ordering Vagabundo.  I did not like any of the songs from that CD.  His lirics and music are not that great
5,"Texas is home to many different musical styles, and Adolph Hofner is one of those artists who seems to capture nearly every one of them in his recordings.  What strikes me is that while many would label his music as &quot;diverse,&quot; Hofner would probably have just called it &quot;music.&quot;  The fact that Hofner is not well known and celebrated nationally puzzles me, for I believe he is one of the great Texas recording artists of all time, which puts him in grand company"
5,"What an amazing DVD, not only the music is great the visual effects are extraordinary.  A definite must buy"
2,"It feels as though she has lost her energy, she has become a distant memory of what she used to be with Mecano. Still a sweet voice, the songs chosen for this CD are mediocre. Her first solo CD was good, this was is not. The music just doesn't click, the art in the sleeve doesn't click either, maybe she needs new composers, a different producer. The Pink Floyd track is regrettable, she should not sing in English, she can sing in Spanish and French but I would suggest her to refrain from doing it in English. Maybe the Cano brothers should compose her new material, maybe Mecano should make a comeback..."
2,"this not a terrible album, but it is not that good either, and this, when  coupled with the fact that there are many other bands doing very similar  things much better than knapsack, means that it probably isn't worth the  investment. i have never heard any of their other albums, but this one had  neither wonderful guitar work nor intriguing vocals, and the lyrics (which  have been called brilliant by one of the official reviewers) leave  something to be desired. the first time you hear this album, you will  probably like it, but after three or four more times all the way through, i  think you will probably be either skipping half the songs, taking the album  out after three songs, or running to your local used cd store to get some  of your poorly invested money back. it just doesn't have that lasting  quality that a great album has; this album does not leave you wanting more,  as a brilliant album would do. in short, not a terrible album but not worth  paying full price for, especially when there are so many bands out their  which are doing the whole emo-punk-pop thing much better"
5,"Yes, it is missing some good songs from ELO (I would've like to see All Over The World from Xanadu on here and Rockaria, my favorite ELO song, among others). But this is a Greatest Hits album, not a 'All the good songs from ELO' album. This isn't for die hard fans, it's for casual fans who heard a few songs on the radio and want a greatest hits album to hear some other tunes. The songs on here are great and will probably influence them to buy ELO's other full length albums."
5,"From the intimate clubs of the world to the stage at Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, Lynne Arriale continues to prove why she is the First Lady of Melodic Jazz.  I do not believe that I can adequately describe her music and that of the great Lynne Arriale Trio, and so I would encourage you to listen to some of the ""cuts"" here at Amazon.  Not only is Lynne an excellent composer, she and her trio interpret the music of other's like no one else.  Listen to their interpretation of Burt Bacharach's ""A House Is Not A Home"" and see if it doesn't rip your heart out.  I cannot recommend the music of the Lynne Arriale Trio enough.  Why not take a moment and enrich your life buy making a purchase of the Trio's latest release: Inspiration.  And, while you're at it, if you don't have their other recordings, may I suggest to add them to your music library as well.  You will NOT be disappointed.  I am happy to end this review in the way I most often like to:  DAYTON SAYS:  BUY THIS CD"
1,Were is my boy Prince man this really ticked me off he is only on one song first disc just another sucker then you dont hear him anymore maybe they were alking about us if your a prince fan dont buy this unless you collect his songs like i do cause just another sucker is all you get for a person that collects i dont have that one
5,This often overlooked CD is probably the very best all around recording of Kenny's.  It's got everything!  It's bluesy and beautiful and the material is very well rounded.  The tune &quot;Since I Fell For You&quot; sounds  like it could have been written for Kenny and &quot;'Round Midnight&quot;  maybe the definitive version of an often recorded masterpiece. Buy this  record.  You won't regret it
2,"I'm a metal head but I'm not a fan of this type of metal but the quality is good and these guys are somewhat from my area, but I'm just not a fan of the Rah, Rah, Rah, Blah, Blah screaming mess. I love the guitars and the band itself just NO vocals and melody. It's very one dimensional, but different strokes for different folks. If you like war hooting and demon squealing Death Metal then you'll love this. Sorry guys not a fan of it (just an opinion though, don't get bent over it)"
1,"The album is rushed, being produced just in 8 days.  It did not showcase Casey's talent and sales charts speak even louder. Poor Casey. She deserves a better album than this"
1,I was suckered into buying this years ago and the sound was so bad that I immediately sold it as used for pennies on the dollar.  I strongly suggest you buy another anthology of their music instead
1,"Damn Yankees was a supergroup containing Ted Nugent,Tommy Shaw(STYX),Jack Blades(Nightranger)and someother guy. All talented musicians, who are best heard in their prespective groups. Damn Yankees just doesn't rock,like it should. I've given it a chance and just can't get into it. A lot of talent involved, just doesn't do anything for me"
5,"Every track on this album is a standout.  An instant classic from a classic band.  The boys have never rocked harder, sang better, and grooved groovier.  I can't get this CD out of player.  I can't get the hooks out of my mind- I go to sleep at night humming one of the tunes, usually the Joseph Williams-sung chorus on ""Bottom of Your Soul.""  I absolutely loved the guest musicians on this record- James Pankow(Chicago)and Ian Anderson (Jethro Tull) especially.  I don't know if you can Call Steve Porcaro a ""guest-musician,"" especially with artistic work with the overall sonic ""canvas"" and cool timbres he is able to evoke.  He is a genius. Why these guys can't get any radio airplay in the States anymore is beyond me.  They are so much better than all of the crap that comes out on the radio nowadays. I hope they tour the US hard for the next couple of years and win over old-fans and new converts."
4,This Band is pretty good i think it had potenial to become better &quot;BoneThrower&quot; is prob the best song on here but i could be wrong all of the songs are worthy and could be hits its alot better than Limp Bizkit and Puddle Of Mudd which come from the same record company as these guys.....but i put this band in the standards of SoundGarden which is saying alot if you like SoundGarde
5,This cd rocks!  I bought it years ago and still listen to it all the time.  I love the indigo girls
5,"Owning most of their output, this is my favorite, followed by ""Mirror Conspiracy"" and then ""Cosmic Game"". Re-mixed tunes from obscure (to me) artists segue into one another for over an hour's musical world tour, Thievery-Style.  Their musical perspective explores the best elements of each choice, moving on at the perfect time to keep you interested and wanting more. Unlike a lot of CDs, this set stays strong towards the end!  Stand outs: 'International Flight' 'Sea Groove' 'Cramp your Style' 'Re-return of the Original Artform' 'Expo in Tokyo' 'My French Brother'  Super-nice artwork and cover treatments.  Take this to a party only if you never want to see it again"
5,"This album is a classic...every f-in track....it'll take you back....waaaay back....it'll make you bounce,it'll make you angry,it'll lift you up,and it'll make you cry...a C.D. you cannot quit playing and always nice soul food to go back to...you gotta get it and you gotta get it now "
5,"A recording that will stand the test of time and serve as a reminder of just what a genius Schenker is with a Gibson Flying V.  A lot of my friends listened to this CD for the first time and simply said; ""Holy smokes! Where did he come from?"" I then tell them he recorded this 25 years ago and was way younger than most of them.  They were all utterly speechless and now are fans.  What a great solo effort and Schenker came out of the gates with guns ablazing.  Incredible material, song writing, production and performance by all band members.  Simon Phillips is a very talented drummer and lays down some serious tracks.  Highlight of this CD is the solo at the end of ""Lost Horizons"", that is mind boggling guitar work that is beyond replication.  This is a staple for anyone who follows extreme guitar talent and has an appreciation for master guitar work that will live on as long as music is played.  Awesome!"
5,"Van Go Gan is excellent. I'd been waiting many months to recieve this cd and was thrilled and surprised once it arrived. Every song is strong in it's arrangements and vocals. In my estimation every track is interesting but with ""Kiss Life"", ""International"", ""Sunrise Sunset"" being standouts. This cd also contains a unique spin on ""Now Sue"" and never get tired of hearing ""I Need You"" which has interesting harmonies and background vocals. As one reviewer stated some songs are simple and uncluttered, it's just the vocals and a guitar done acoustically. This cd is always in rotation in my player and highly recommended"
5,"As a jazz guitar player, i personally love stan getz, and to hear him with ray brown, one of my favorite and greatest bass players ever. This was also the first i have listened to Herb Ellis play, his parts are a bit quiet but hey all guitarist were quiet until Charlie Christian. All in Four Really great musicians playing together, if you like this , check out russell malone, ray brown and monty alexander's Cd."
4,"In the 1990s, the Country Music began to go through some transitions. Country music which had for the most part stayed in a vacuum began to go mainstream and embrace other genres of music. As a result, the sound started to change. One artist that led this transition was Faith Hill.   Faith Hill had previously released two albums, but it was her 1998 breakthrough album ""Faith"" that helped her break into mainstream music.  Surprisingly, while ""Faith"" did cross-over into the mainstream, there still is a strong country element on this album.   By no means do I consider myself a Country Music expert.  The nice thing about ""Faith"" is that I believe it caters to a fan like myself that may not be deep into Country Music, but can appreciate many of the elements Country Music can bring to the table.   While ""Faith"" could be directed to a more casual fan like myself, I think the collection does an admirable job at addressing the fan who is deeper when it comes to the Country Music genre.   Faith Hill brings an interesting formula to this album.  Faith's role on the collection is primarily of vocalist.  Since she is focused on vocals, she is dependent on a solid cast of characters (musicians and songwriters) to support her effort.  On ""Faith"", this doesn't appear to be a problem.  She is surrounded by many top notch studio musicians and is given an oustanding slate of songs to work with.  Given this solid infrastructure, Faith is able to provide stellar vocals and produce a great product.   The interesting twist to this formula is that Faith Hill is a co-producer on all 12 songs.   Therefore she just isn't a ""vocalist for hire"".  She ultimately is deciding what the songs should be and how the final product should sound.  This is why ""Faith"" is a solid collection.  ""This Kiss"" was the song that made Faith Hill a household name on the mainstream music scene.   This was also the song that was my first introduction to Faith Hill.  In 1998, I first heard this song on the radio and it completely blew me away.   One reason why this song made it into the mainstream arena is that it does have qualities that make it sound like a ""pop"" song.  However, there is a true country element to this song - complete with Steel Guitar and Fiddle (played by Glen Duncan).    This instrumentation gives the song a most unique flavor.  The song features some very clever and catchy lyrics such as ""It's a centrifugal motion; It's perpetual bliss; It's that pivotal moment"".  The vocals are delivered with a very up-tempo pace (with little rests between the words) and that also contribute to the unique flavor.  This song features some great background vocals by Chris Rodriguez (who provides background vocals on several other songs on the album) and Beth Nielson Chapman (who is a co-writer for this song).  At first, upon purchasing ""Faith"", I expected it would basically be ""This Kiss"" and not much else.  However, after my first listen to this collection - I realized that this was not the case.   There were many other terrific songs that are included on this collection.   The second song ""You Give Me Love"" is also pretty catchy.  This has much more of a country element on this song.  This song is highlighted by some terrific drums and more Fiddle by Glen Duncan.   Although not as catchy a song, ""Let Me Let Go"" is worth mentioning.  The highlight of this particular song is background vocals by Vince Gill.  Gill is a master in the domain of steering Country Music toward the mainstream, but not abandoning the Country Music element.  This song clearly has a Country Element and it works.  This song also features a string section of viola players.  The Country Music element is alive and well in the song ""Better Days"".   This song was co-written by former Fleetwood Mac vocalist Billy Burnette.  This song also features Duncan's Fiddle.    The Country Music element is also present in the song ""My Wild Frontier"".   This is a powerful and sad song about a woman, who with her family moves into the Canadian Prairie.  Tragedy then strikes when the woman's baby son dies in his sleep.  This song is a great example of some of how a very well written song is made even better by some very emotional and powerful vocals by Faith.  The best song on the album is ""The Secret of Life"".   This song was co-written by Gretchen Peters, who is a songwriter that worked with Bryan Adams on ""On a Day Like Today"" and his ""Unplugged"" album.   The song is about exactly what the title says - telling little bits on what ""the secret of life is"".   No loss of a solid country feel in this song - including more great fiddle by Duncan.  Simple lyrics like ""The Secret of Life is in Sam's Martini"" (Sam is a character that is referred to in the song) or ""The Secret of Life is a Good Cup of Coffee"" give this song a very special quality.  Two other country element songs are that are solid are ""Just to Hear You Say That You Love Me"" and ""The Hard Way"".  In ""Just to Hear You Say You Love Me"", Faith does a terrific duet with her husband Tim McGraw.   As for ""The Hard Way"", this is very powerful song (more great Fiddle) and is best described by the lyrics ""I Keep Livin and Lovin and Learnin The Hard Way"".  Finally, ""Me"" is another good song - this song has more of a pop element and deals with a woman changing who she is.  On a side note, Sheryl Crow is a co-writer of ""Somebody Stand By Me"".  Not a great song, but worth mentioning.  All of the lyrics, studio musicians, songwriting and production credits are listed in the liner notes.  This album should appeal to Country Music and Mainstream fans.  Highly Recommended"
1,"Lie to me and Wander this world are so much different and much much better, if you are a blues fan. I bought it for ""Give me up again"", which is in a very good version on the Clapton DVD ""Crossroads Festival"". The rest is more like a Prince style, Pitty, hardly any guitar, Jonny is slipping away from the blues"
4,"Just saw the ""kid"" the other night and the tracks he played from Long Time Coming blew the house away. What is missing on the studio versions are the blistering (understatement) leads he incorporated. The title track and Give Me Up Again both earned well deserved standing ovations. I can't wait for a live album. Myself, I just mixed a CD incorporating the best of all three albums and Long Time Coming makes it an all around great listen."
5,"As for these songs great!!! The cd in general cover and all super great!!! 5 stars on Westside Connection. This is probably my second favorite cd 1 after (2 Pac) these guys (Mac 10 WC and Ice Cube) they can rap and there beats these are the kinda songs I have bumpin in my ride all the time, this is what I call hard core oldschool rap. This is the kinda rap thats true not this rap crap!!! of today. I cant explain to you it's just the lyrics and the way they rap to them. You just put it all together and you get a really sick cd like this one (bow down). Now I have to say this is to another cd that I like every song on it it's just like the knew akwid, I love every song on that cd but on this 1 I do have favorites like of course (Bow Down, Gangsta's Make The World Go Round, Do You Like Crimainals, The Gangsta The Killer And The Dope Dealer, Westside Ho, Hoo Banin) damm!!! thats like most of the cd but I got to tell you all the songs are great this is definitly a must bump in your ride cd believe me  this cd will have you bumpin. westside connection you doin fine!!!"
1,"I don't need ""MISFITS"" wannabe's in the good ol' united states so I definetely dont need some woah woah ooh crap sung in japanese! Buy Earth a.d., Static Age,Walk Among Us,Legacy of Brutality or hell even Evilive to see what these losers wish they were. Just cause your songs are like fater than hell doesn't mean their good"
5,"This is undeniably a tragic yet great album.  A friend of mine can't play it anymore, because he can't stand hearing a soul in torment, which is what the album is.  It's so naked emotionally.  Spence just bears everything, his very being, his very soul.  The only other albums that come close to this is Nick Drake's final studio album, Pink Moon, and Lee Hazlewood's emotionally wretching Requiem for an Almost Lady.  I won't recount Spence's back story, for other reviewers have done it very well.  The songs go right to your very being.  There is no BS here.  This was who Spence was at the time, warts and all.  It is a testament to another sensitive, young soul destroyed by celebrity, the ""business"", drugs, etc., etc..  This was Spence's only real solo album, and it's a true masterpiece, mysterious, moving, and beautiful. "
2,"This work was recorded at Eastern Sound in Toronto under the worst of creative conditions,produced by Vinnie Testa who's only claim to fame was supposedly being aquainted with Shadow Morton who produced the Fudge.The album was released on MGM Lion and followed the release of the single Lost Son which was a London Parrot single. Now the facts:Earth Omen,New Horizon and Lost Son were in truth composed as a trilogy by Jon Wearing who had been working with another Michigan artist and associate Dick Wagner after the demise of the Frost.Wagner went on to form Ursa Major and Wearing who had been working in the Detroit music scene since 1966 with the Tidalwaves and had a hit Farmer John signed with Pink with the agreement for the first work 20% of his writing would be distributed equally among the other members of the band who were totally lost and down and out. Testa and Wearing could never see eye to eye, the management had no idea what they were doing, IRS and legal issues and the entire project was a wash and Wearing left to form a very good R&B influenced rock band called Deluxe. Deluxe toured with Joe Walsh, James Cotton, Atlanta Rhythm Section,opened for Seger and many others.Dallas Hodge,Ray Craig,KimballLee,Greg Caulder and Wearing comprised the band that had been targeted by Epic to sign. Leo Fenn part of the Alice Cooper business organization and Wearing pal was the manager until heads got out of control in part do to Johnny Winter's medling and then John Sinclair became the manager and demise of this fine act. Hodge continues to work with Canned Heat overseas and Wearing still provides moments with the Detroit based Ghostband.Wearing attempted to provide some quality to Pink however was stiffled by the mis-management of Clyde Stevers and Marv Wilson. Enough for now, The Truth"
5,"This greatest hits collection is a nice overview of Jermaine's work from the late '70s, through to the early '90s.  There are some great upbeat dance tracks along with some slow jams.  The only downside to this collection is that it doesn't include &quot;When the rain begins to fall&quot;, a duet that he did with Pia Zadora back in 1983/84.  This doesn't take away from the other classics like &quot;Do what you do&quot;, and &quot;Dynamite&quot;.  I seemed to have a few singles of Jermaine's from back in the day, so it's nice to have his songs on CD to enjoy for a long time.  There are other greatest hit collections out there, but I opted for this one because it was released by Arista, which was one of 3 labels that Jermaine was signed with.  It sounds clear &amp; clean, not screechy like some other older recordings converted to CD do.  If you like some great r&amp;b, then Jermaine Jackson's &quot;Heritage Collection&quot; will hit the spot"
1,"I bought this never having problems from Amazon.com before.  They did not state that this was a Sony product and when I received it, all the CD had on it was a root kit virus.  It would not even play in my CD player.  When I tried to read the CD to copy and burn the ""WAV"" files to a new CD so I could just listen to the music, all there were on the CD was executables and no sound files.  Sony is very poor quality now and I do not want to buy it again"
5,it's hard to imagine getting all these artists to perform on one single recording of this magnitude. my hat goes off to mark for this extremly important work of ar
4,"I was downloading some shows when I came across a show by some band called  Galactic. I liked it but didn't think much about it. Then last week I saw  Counting Crows and LIVE in concert. When I got there, there was this band  jamming out. I saw the second half of their set, all the time wondering  &quot;who are these guys?&quot; Then they announced that they were  Galactic. The next day I went and bought this CD and I could not be  happier. The blend of funky blues-like singing, jazzy horn play, and the  rock guitar riffs is awesome. This band reminds me very much of a jazz trio  called Medeski, Martin, and Wood. However, Galactic offers great singing  and horns giving them a much more diverse sound. For me, this is one of  those CD's that I don't know any of the song titles because whenever I  listen to it, I listen to the whole thing straight. If you like jazz and  you like jam bands, get this album"
1,ITEM NEVER RECEIVED. IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTACT BY EMAIL THE CUSTOMER SERVICE. MY LAST PURCHASE ON AMAZON 
5,"Great song. I love Patti Smith's version but this one's even better. That song alone is worth however much you pay for this album. Plus you get other rare gems (and great Bruce songs) such as Fire, Seeds and Paradise by the ""C"" (great title!), not to mention killer versions of Bruce classics such as Rosalita, Born to Run, Thunder Road, Badlands, Darkness on the Edge of Town, The River, Independence Day, etc. Whether you're a completist or a huge fan of The Boss (I fall in the latter camp), you really should pick this up."
4,"this  makes awesome workout (elliptical, running, treadmill) music for interval training; wonderfully paced..... can just SEE a Martha Graham choreo. to it while you work out"
5,"I got this album because it was recommended to me by Amazon.com's computerized recommendations system. Being adventurous, I bought it on a whim. I was very pleasantly surprised! Unlike many other popular trance anthems with female vocals, this one is not at all cheesy or monotonous. All of the tracks feature high-quality production and skillful mixing: no amateurish boom-tss filler anywhere on this single. Mavie Marcos has a gorgeously supple voice (reminds me of Kirsty Hawkshaw) and nice pronunciation (I know that it's not politically correct to say this, but it bugs me when the vocalist sounds like a chavette who has gone through accent-reduction training). I highly recommend this CD to anyone who has good taste! Even IDM snobs will appreciate the intricate layering of sound in these tracks"
5,"Yes, I was once like you.  Enraptured by XTC's more lush productions like Skylarking.  But maturity encouraged me to pay closer attention to GO 2 and it has proven to be their finest hour.  Pure, raw, creative energy captured on tape.  This is what Andy and Colin are capable of when not distracted by their more Beatlesque leanings.  There are lots of good tunes on the later albums, of course.  Drums and Wires and English Settlement are personal favorites.  But XTC never exploded with this level of combustion again"
5,"Does &quot;XTC&quot; mean &quot;mannered, pretentious, overworked drivel&quot; to you? Well, then. Twenty years and more since I first heard them, I think that this is their best album, with Drums and Wires a close second. By Black Sea they were sinking into the Sergeant Pepperization process that would reduce those countless later albums to meaninglessness. This is raw, vital rock music, wonderfully edgy and surprising, from a time in the band's history when they were effortlessly creative, instead of belaboring us, as the Rev. Partridge eventually ended up doing, with their attempts to Have Something To Say"
1,"This is one of the worst, not to mention most downright annoying albums to come out in recent memory.  Anyone who claims to like this overrated insult to underground music is just trying to sound cool, and failing miserably.  In fact, I'll go out on a limb here and say that anyone who says they like this album hasn't even heard the damn thing, and probably just saw it on a pitchfork list somewhere - and if pitchfork says it's good, it must be good, right?  Wrong.  This album sucks.  It's sad to see people so desperate for indie cred (which, I hate to break it to you, isn't that cool either) that they degrade themselves by publicly admitting they enjoy this album.  However, I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys hearing Steve Albini ramble on like a douche, with mediocore music being played in the background.  Everyone else, save yourself the trouble and the $10"
4,"When Harry Reser wasn't leading the two best hot white jazz bands of the 1920's, the Six Jumping Jacks and the Clicquot Club eskimos, he was making these incredible banjo recordings. Think of Harry Reser as the Les Paul of the 1920's. His fingers were the fastest in the world and his technique was jaw dropping. He seems to playing chords and picking at the same time or is he playing two banjos at once? This particular album will appeal more to guitarists and musicians than to those seeking twenties pop music. For those, grab the other Harry Reser albums on Amazon"
4,"This recording of Messiah is an attempt at using period instruments (either authentic or replicas from the Baroque period) and performing it in the correct manner of ""Baroque performance"" (at least as best as we can know).  Clearly there are many difficulties in trying to accurately pull this off, but the result does seem to be very Baroque.    Reviewers have two main objections, which the prospective listener should keep in mind.  Many Messiah fans are used to ""un-Baroque"" performances of Messiah--a 100+ member chorus singing with a full tone, a large orchestra, large dynamic contrasts, and slower tempos.  When people accustomed to such performances hear Hogwood's recording, it is often labeled as ""dry,"" ""unemotional,"" or ""light.""    Other reviewers object to the quality of the performance itself.  I think that the soloists could do a better job.  The bass is strong, but he could be better, and I think there should be more ornamentation overall.  I personally like the sound of boys singing instead of adult women in the choir, but others may differ.  Other Baroque recordings such as Gardiner, McGegan, or Harnoncourt are also good period recordings.  If you want more traditional interpretations, take a look at Thomas Beecham's or Robert Shaw's recordings.  If you're looking for a complete, scholarly interpretation, however, I think this is a great recording.  Oh, and the accompanying booklet is great, too--very thorough."
5,"Beautiful music and a nice variety, what you would expect from Windhill.  The only flaw, tracks five and six are switched from the list on the album cover; #5 is &quot;First Noel&quot; and #6 is &quot;Christmas Is Coming&quot;.  Highly recommended"
1,Pure pretention.  Anyone really interested in true post-modern art can find more compelling works elsewhere.  Minus 5 stars. 
5,"this is one of those bluegrass albums. you cant be without, i love everysong from this album not a bad one at all. bluegrass albums are my favorites by him i was raised on bluegrass music. and i know alot about ricky skaggs, from my dad who is also a mandolin picker and singer and he had the great joy of meeting ricky's sister at a studio once... would love to meet the man himself someday if your a bluesgrass or a rickyskaggs fan then get the album you'll be glad you did"
5,"I love this album!  It takes me back to the islands, basking in the sun, sipping a mai tai, w/ some local cats playing under the palapa.  I'm a big fan of the Aqua Velvets, and Miles playing is stunninly gorgeous on this cd  as well"
5,"I saw a great show at Fishlips in Bakersfield last Wednesday: Wayne ""The Train"" Hancock. He sang like a modern-day Hank Williams, and had a great band, just Jake on stand up bass, and Johnny on the Telecaster. Wayne just strummed an acoustic guitar, one stroke per beat, but was always right in the pocket, his guitar was holding down the tempo while the electric guitar filled in when he wasn't singing, and the bass just kept the beat going like crazy. It is a testament to the trio's chops that they could inspire someone to dance right from the first song. They had a really crazy rhythm going and it never let up. And there was not even a drummer in the band. The bass player was always pushing the beat, but with perfect placement, and intonation, which ain't that easy on a fretless stand up bass.  Wayne played for about 2 hours, and he let his girlfriend Gina play a few songs while he took a break. I took that opportunity to get Wayne's autograph. When he got back on stage he sang and talked about all the counties where he was incarcerated. Quite a few.  I loved the show, it was a prodigious display of musical virtuosity. If you closed your eyes you could have sworn it was Hank Williams, yet he had his own style, and wasn't just a clone of Hank. He was what Hank would sound like if he were alive and just a little bit older than Hank Williams III, his grandson is right now.   The songs on Tulsa are great, and whether he is live or in the studio, he sounds fantastic. Wayne Hancock refuses to compromise his music, to sweeten it, to make it more commercial, to do anything other than play music he really feels deep down inside, and to make you feel it deep down inside, too. "
5,"Along with the one song I've been looking for, this has a lot of great songs"
5,"Clocking in at a little less than 60 Minutes, 'Scratchology' will definately take you through the study of Scratching importance in Hip Hop history. The next time you're thinking of taking a drive or a walk, pop this CD in your player and let it ride, because it will definately take you down memory lane with flavor added by The X-Ecutioners"
2,"Censored &quot;bits&quot; of Lenny Bruce.  His earliest work, but not nearly as great as he was to become.  Has some great stuff but not really his best work. Get a live performance for the real reason people love  Lenny"
2,"I bought this CD based on the fact that I liked Ultra Dance 2.  I thought the third one would be another good CD to listen to for the summer.  I was disappointed when I got my CDs and listened to them.  The mixes on these songs are terrible, with the exception of two tracks.  On the other hand, Ultra Dance 2, which is mixed by DJ Encore, is much better in comparison.  Although the songs on Ultra Dance 2 are last year songs, it is worth more than this one.  Trust me, you are not missing anything"
1,"OK. I just got this CD today, and now i'm happy. Was late, but only got this album for ""good morning beautiful"""
5,As another reviewer said. This may be the easiest CD to wear out in 10 days
4,"At a rather hip friend's insistence, I first heard this album in mid to late high school (circa 1995).  Seeing as that those years were ground zero for teenage angst and all that comes with being hormonal, confused, and lovelorn, I seized onto this band with a fervor (right along with Mineral, Seam, and a few others).  To this day, when I hear the opening bass chords and the swelling drums of the first song, I instinctively grit my teeth, get my rock face on, and prepare to air drum on my steering wheel.  This is a powerful record, one that bends and weaves with a beautiful intensity throughout.  The desperation of hardcore is still very much a presence in TITR's music, but it's bound tight with melody, memorable time signatures, and pop-savvy structures.  Granted, Garrett's voice can drive people away from the band if they aren't willing to give it time (he's more than a tad nasal), but the songs stick with you. Definitely an album to purchase if you're even momentarily interested in the mid-'90's tail end of the ""emo/post hardcore"" movement. As for the guy who suggested that the EP was better than this full-length, don't believe it.  Get this, and dig in"
1,"In the 70's there was American  British and Canadian rock. Its a shame that most living outside of Canada didn't get an opportunity to hear a lot more of the Canadian product. My biggest beef with all of the April Wine ""greatest hits"" compilations was the fact that most of the rocking early years has been largely ignored. Who put these compilations together? Where was lead singer/songwriter/guitarist Myles Goodwyn during all of this? Where is ""Fast Train, Bad Side of the Moon, Drop Your Guns, Electric Jewels, Weeping Widow, Just Like That, You Could Have Been a Lady, Anything You Want, Victim for Your Love, Forever for Now, Cat's Claw, Come on Along, The Band Has Just Begun"" etc etc etc? The albums ""Electric Jewels, On Record and Stand Back"" as well as ""Live at the El Mocambo"" are much more representative of April Wine. Canada rocked, we really did. You just wouldn't know it from this pap."
2,"I have to admit that I had not really listened to Mika before I saw him in concert in Stockholm. He does what he does reasonably well for this genre. Good falsetto voice although it gets a bit loud and annoying during the show. Here is what made me lose all respect for this artist. During his show in Stockholm he only played for 60 minutes, including an encore. I am sorry, but no artist worth anything would walk away only playing 60 minutes. Overall I would say ok voice, pretty weak songwriting, and pathetic live show. I lost what little respect I gained for Mika during the first few songs. Weak, weak, weak."
1,"This CD is just plain horrible.  It lacks in real talent and it is as cliche as you can get.  Hey, The Grateful Dead was a good band, but new hippie-wanna-be bands just don't have the talent.  The only people who buy  these albums are just 14 year old freshmen in High School looking for an  excuse to be &quot;popular.&quot;  Well, my bashing has been done, so I  will leave you on this note;  If you hear twinkle-twinkle-little-star music  once, doesn't it just get plain boring"
1,"I Purchased the Winter Solstice Vol #3 thinking that it would be as good as the rest,was I disappointed. Tracks 5,6,7,10,11.13 are atrocious,the rest of the tracks are good.I cant get to my CD player fast enough to skip over them when they start playing.I now sample every song on the CDs and dont take for granted that all Winter Solstices are created equal.People,please start giving honest reviews and stop the false advertisement"
5,"I noticed this CD because of the name of the band and the suggestions from other Amazon customers. I must say it is one of my favorite CD's! The songs have great rythmn and the energy of the artists translate beautifully even though I don't speak Spanish or Japanese(one of my favorite songs!)Everyone-aged from 17 to 83 that has heard this CD, will request me to play it when they visit. Pepe's voice reminds me so much of Ricky Ricardo, that I'm surprised the album isn't called ""Latenight Lucy""!! Can't wait for the release of their next CD.  "
2,"I heard ""Heart of Mine"" in the closing credits for the movie Runaway Jury.  After listening to the album, I found that was really the only tune I liked.  Peter Malick is a veteran of the hard-charging James Montomery Band (who I have seen tear up stages of Northeast blues clubs), which is why the sleepiness of most of these pieces mystifies me.  You could argue that he is going for a ""relaxed"" feel, to which I would repsond he succeeds all too well.  Norah Jones can sing, and sing well- no argument there, but these songs are not great.  The lyrics I found to be a little too clever, like some music student's term paper.  For most of the album I felt like everyone was trying way too hard to do something deep and meaningful.  Having said all this, ""Heart of Mine"" is an excellent record, and might even be worth the price of the CD.  Of course, to get the one good track, you could try downloading it for a dollar from itunes or your favorite MP3 site."
2,"Jill Sobule really hit it big with her first hit &quot;I Kissed a Girl&quot;, which is on her second self-titled album &quot;Jill Sobule&quot;.  This first album  isn't really all that good; like she was  still finding herself.  For a better album, check out her &quot;Jill  Sobule&quot; album or even better &quot;Happy Town&quot;"
5,"This album deserves to be (at least) as popular as Led Zeppelin's first two albums or Deep Purple's ""In Rock"" and ""Machinehead"" albums. Simply great. And by the way, you should check out Ten Years After's ""A Space in Time"" too. The high point of the album, which includes many fine tracks, is ""Come Together in the Morning"". And the original version of ""Wishing Well"" is so much more powerful than the better-known version by Gary Moore, which just doesn't do the song justice. While many reviewers rave about Paul Kossoff's guitar work, I think this album is a real showcase for Paul Rodgers, one of rock music's greatest singers"
2,"I know that this review will be followed by several saying that I am stupid and am not aware of how awesome Shadows Fall is, but I still think it is worthwhile to let other people know my opinion. I was excited for this album, Shadows Fall shows so much potential at times but this release is such a disappointment. While it isn't terrible, it just is not good. It suffers the pitfall of many metal releases, all the songs follow identical formats and never keep your interest. If you don't believe me, scan through this CD and let me know if almost all (with the exception of one or two) aren't : a kind of cool guitar intro that might lead to something cool, then drums come in with the same predictable snare on every beat,and then mediocre vocals singing some of the most lackluster vocal in recent memory.  Don't buy this album looking for some sort of blistering heavy metal experience. Don't buy this album if you want something you may replay again. If you want to buy a mediocre heavy metal album then I guess you should buy this album, but I say take a stand. Don't just buy whatever Shadows Fall puts out in front of you. The War Within was a good CD. The follow up bonus track CD was just a desperate attempt to make more money with nothing new and this CD is just a group that didn't really try and put out some music.  I'm sorry to all the die hard Shadows Fall fans, and you may enjoy this album which is great for you, but I really felt like Shadows Fall underachieved and didn't really put enough into this release. I know they could have done better"
2,"I bought this to assist my recovery from a long bout with Lyme disease.  I found it minimally useful.  It is relaxing, but I was hoping some more creative visualizations directed toward healing one's body.  Perhaps it is intended to heal the soul, which may ultimately heal the body, but I was disappointed"
4,I was hapy to receive this cd and almost all of the songs play correctly but the last two songs will not play unless you do it manually. I Have a High end Harmon Kardon System so that is not why. I cleaned the disc but still no straight playthrough.   My wife is p'od since she doesn't know how to manually start these two songs. 
1,"If you wish to learn something interesting re the fact that the keys of b minor and Bb major share the note D as their third, you would do far better to consult a decent recording of Beethoven's Hammerklavier Sonata than this navel-gazing narcissistic atrocity"
1,"THIS SHOULD PROBABLY GO TO CUSTOMER SERVICE, BUT YOUR RETURN POLICY SAYS YOU CAN'T RETURN OPENED CDs so if I can't return it, perhaps others can learn from this what can happen when you order online. I thought I was getting the whole CD and when I opened it and put it on, it turned out to have the song Not Ready to Make Nice, one other song and then some video of Not Ready to Make Nice. I checked with a friend who has the album and she said there should be lots of other songs on it. Can you send me the album I thought I was buying"
5,Get this cd! The entire cd is a joyous experience. This is R&B Soul at it's best......
2,I was hyped about them coming back after they rocked on DJ Quik's Rhythmalism.that album was slammin'but this disc is about 5 years past the pull date on style.Up 'N Da CLub is tight.straight up DJ Quik is a Musical  Genius.but he can't pull this disc off Properly.AMG is banging on the track  but overall it's missing something
1,"Unfortunately, perhaps, I am a performing musician (voice, keyboards, flute, guitar, and a smathering of other instruments)as well as a composer, and also a fan of fresh, innovative treatments of familiar tunes. I search out and buy two or three new Christmas CD's each year and listen to them non-stop for the month of December. I had great hopes that this Liebert CD would be inspiring and was disappointed that it was the opposite. Each tune follows the formula of the rhythm section playing a straight-ahead version of whatever song with Liebert playing a totally traditional, single-note melody on top, often co-mingled with a couple of motifs from another Christmas song. The rhythm section plays the same traditional chord progressions again while Liebert &quot;jams,&quot; using the same trite, tired riffs. BORING"
1,"Admittedly, I don't scour the surface of the Earth for hard to find B, C, and D-class tracks to add to my metal collection. If you do, you may agree with the novelist who wrote the first review on this set. As for me, this is one of those items that you just have to admit to yourself was a mistake and file it with sanitation engineering. Luckily, I got mine on clearance"
1,"One of the best pieces of rock ever recorded, one of the worst reissue I ever heard. Do not buy this Japanese import! If you know what this album is suppose to sound like then you will want to cry when you hear Sony's butchering of this reissue. I am not being over critical here, this mix will make you cringe, or maybe we are just getting spoiled by Rhino's superb job? It's a cryin sham"
5,"The music set to Midsummer Night's Dream arranged here by Boswell yields good things but is not entirely great. For instance, since the movie had the story set in Tuscany, Italy, there are a lot of  songs of the opera, since opera was founded in Italy and it makes one feel more at home with the movie location. Also, Intermezzo from Cavalleria Rusticana, an opera intermission music by Mascagni, is heard here. I think these things are all out of place. There should be more emphasis on the music of Shakespeare's time- oboe, flute and Renaissance instruments. The soundtrack to &quot;Much Ado About Nothing &quot; is even better since it does manage to remain Shakespearian. But otherwise this music is beautiful, especially the Midsummer Night's Dream Music by Mendelsshon -the Overture is a delightful, sunny piece to hear and then there is the famous signature Wedding March. I recommend anyone to get the entire classical work- the Scherzo is just as good and other selections. This cd is good but not great. In opera, it has featured its brightest stars- Fleming, Domingo and Bartoli. But a great cd nonetheless"
5,Byrd&amp;Burrell really stand out here.The Music here is very essential to the ear.Donald Byrd has Been Bad for SO Long that it's Amazing at his Depth&amp;Talent.The Music Here is in a Class all onto it's own.A Must have  from Two Legends.The Arrangements&amp;Productions are tight
5,"If you're looking for a collection of just the hits, stick with 2003's SOUNDS OF SUMMER. If you need a nostalgia fix for the Beach Boys' best albums of the Sixties through the mid-Seventies, pick up the two-fers of their classic albums from SURFIN' SAFARI through SURF'S UP. However, if you want a solid overview of America's most influential band and why Brian Wilson is regarded as a genius, wrap your ears around this 5-disc GOOD VIBRATIONS box set. Brian Wilson and company take you on a  magical history tour from their debut single ""Surfin'"" to their final No. 1, ""Kokomo."" ESSENTIA"
1,"Save your money and buy something else. The Dylan performances are few and uninspired. The rest -- peformances of Dylan -- are sometimes good, sometimes amusing, sometimes odd, but don't amount to much as a collection. I wanted to see the movie until I heard the soundtrack"
5,This album blew me away from the moment I heard it. The only downside is there are not many songs with vocals on the album. If you like old funk or soul then this album is for you. These guys will leave footprints in the history books of this genre
5,"This new album by former Mr.Big guitar player Paul  Gilbert is a nice surprise! Beatle-esque melodies coupled with good leading and backing vocals, not forgetting the intrincate, fast melodic guitar riffs and chops  make this a delicious CD. Highlights include the first track &quot;Get  It&quot; with its infectious theme and the ballad &quot;Kate is a  Star&quot;. Listen to flying dog and have a good time"
1,"I have purchased (and returned) four, count 'em, four Green Mile soundtrack CD's because of numerous skips. I keep going back, hoping the problem has been fixed, but no luck. I wrote Warner Brothers about this and I have not received a response to date. Has anyone else run into this frustrating problem"
5,"Satch is full of surprises. Thats the very reason he still has such a strong fan following and keeps getting more popular. In this album he made the right decision by brining in Nathan East, Manu Katche and Andy Fairweather Low as his studio musicians. The virtuosity of every musician on this album is astronomical. Songs like If, Cool no9, down down down, etc are the Satriani you never have heard of before."
5,"Throughout his musical career, Chris De Burgh has offered albums filled with beautiful, creative and imaginative songs.  The Storyman carries this idea to its zenith with a collection of incredible tracks.  ""One World"" is the perfect expression of spiritual and secular equality.  Performed and sung beautifully, it is one of De Burgh's finest moments.  The heart wrenching ""The Shadow Of The Mountain"" and uplifting ""Raging Storm"" are both utterly beautiful.  ""The Sweetest Kiss Of All"" is a touching love song with a fantastic melody.  ""The Mirror Of The Soul"" is classic storytelling in musical form while ""The Storyman"" is a synopsis of all that is De Burgh and his career in one song.  The album, as a collection, is complete, cohesive and well recorded.  Each track stands as an example of the best in songwriting from practically any artist in popular music.    I am personally devastated by the power and beauty of this album.  Chris De Burgh has impressed me once again.  It's an incredible musical accomplishment"
5,"After listening to &quot;Into the Light&quot; and &quot;flying Colours&quot;, I began a search for more music by Chris De Burgh. Although the music differs somewhat in sound from his newer albums, from the moment  I heard Hold On I knew I would enjoy this album. My favorite is probably  Windy Night. But all of them are good respectively. I must say I found it  interesting how he was able to blend alittle of each song on the album onto  the lyrics of the end song, Goodnight. I also can't help but wonder if a  lyric from Satin Green Shutters didn't inspire a later song of his,  Forevermore. Whatever the case this is a wonderful piece for any true CDB  fa"
5,This item was delivered quickly (in time for Christmas) and cost me a lot less than buying it at any music store
2,"Classical music is beautiful and rewarding.  Can't it be rewarding on its own terms, rather than as a &quot;fast track&quot; to the Ivy League and financial success?  When I was a child, my parents played classical music  for us because they loved it, and they hoped we would, too.  I do the same  for my own kids.  But my siblings didn't much like classical music, and  despite the insulting and ludicrous claims made on this CD, their SAT  scores were in line with my own. I think that if Beethoven or Mozart knew  that their beautiful, timeless music was being cheapened into just another  &quot;get ahead quick&quot; scam, they'd roll over in their graves"
5,Harry was one of the great trumpters.  It was a pleasure to listen to his best works again
5,"The Stills are a Montreal indie rock band who write expertly woven melodies crafted in the familiar niche of swirly-80s-post-punksters like Echo & The Bunnymen or The Church, but add a unique neo-vibe which finds them comfortable next to say, Interpol or Bloc Party.  This is their best release by far, every song heart-wrenchingly wrought forward with layered guitars and superb lyrics.  If you like a comfortable mix of brit pop influence, a dash of romanticism and depression, finely crafted into guitar heavy pulsating riffs, then this is for you!  Fans of The Walkmen rejoice--this is the better purchase of the two~this LP is packed full of college radio singles, including ""Gender Bombs"" and ""Changes Are No Good."
1,Sorry but this didn't cut it for me.  It sounded more like a amateur rehersal tape than what i expect from the Beach Boys
5,"Every tune is fab! Thankfully, the remastering has not diminished the old scratchy sound typically found in recordings from this era.  This is why I hate most modern jazz. This has genuine feeling, a raw sound, natural flow, and catchy licks--things lacking these days, IMO.   Pick this up if you are not a huge jazz collector, but just wish to add something worthwile to your otherwise ecclectic collection of music"
2,"Although this album is a bit more insightful and less materialistic than his previous work, with the exception of BluePrint which is a classic and in a class of its own, I wasn't so anxious about him coming back or this album in general. He should've retired after Blueprint if he wanted to do it while he was ontop. The Black Album was alot better than the BluePrint2 which was one disc so-so to good and second disc made of 90% filler.  While this album shows a more storytelling, poet side of Jay-Z, it ain't exactly his best work. Actually this falls down at the bottom, right beneath his 1997 Vol 1 album. While his maturity as an artist has improved, his lyrical content has suffered. The first 5 songs are classic Jay-Z and the last two songs are classic hip-hop but the rest of the album in between sound more like demos of MC such&such. In my opinion, he has faltered quite a bit on this album, this is right under BluePrint2; BluePrint2 should've never been two discs let alone be a sequel to a hip-hop classic. Kingdom Come has a few good moments starting with the intro and leaving at Lost One, then coming back with Minority Report and ending altogether with Beach Chair, which could've had a better song title given the point of the song. Beyonce, Usher & Ne-Yo, John Legend and Chrisete could've been more utilized than singing hooks, let alone singing hooks on so-so songs. More thought could've been put into the album to make it a 3, and more could've been covered to make it a 4. But Jay is starting to let his Def Jam position affect him."
2,"There are two stellar tracks on this: &quot;McCarran Airport,"" sounding like a lost Jimmy Webb classic, and the wistfully gorgeous &quot;Spring Time.&quot; A quick look at the credits show they're the only two from the pen of brother Bruce. As for the rest -- think Kenny G meets H/D/H. Sadly, that stands for Hallmark/Doggerel/Hallmark. And that's too bad, as the vocals and sparse arrangements are right on the money. If there's to be a follow-up, give Bruce free reign"
2,"This album features 70s re-recordings of ET's hits. His Texas Troubodors at the time were a good band, but Ernest's voice had coarsened quite a bit by then. You can now get the original 40s and 50s recordings of Ernest's  hits on the Hall of Fame series. Even the 1958 remakes originally on the  Decca/MCA &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; and &quot;Ernest Tubb Story&quot; were  pretty good...but this album is for completists only"
5,"This album's music is well arranged, with a seductive blend of Spanish guitar and violin.  I've enjoyed every track, and have recommended his music to my music loving friends!!"
1,"What's wrong with BHG? Besides everything? Is it possible for them to write more than one good song in their pathetic lives? My sister burned this CD from a friend, most likely because she likes the Bad Touch song, and I'VE been the one having to hear it in the morning when she's getting ready for school. It's pathetic. I don't know how much I can stress the word ""pathetic"", but it's the only way to fully describe it. Out of 18 tracks, there's one, count it, ONE good song, ""The Inevitable Return of The Great White Dope"", because it's nothing like their other songs. Everything else on this album is just like ""Fire Water Burn"", ""The Bad Touch"", ""Hell Yeah"", you get the picture. Palm-muted, droning, songs with extremely explicit lyrics, which is the only reason people will remember them. Isn't it about time to come out of the 13-16 year old stage? Having lyrics about sex won't get you any. Bands like Blink-182, Sum 41, and System of a Down have funny songs, but they have their limits. About the ""music"": 1)Palm-muting doesn't make a song good. I get it. You can palm-mute. So can most people who play guitar or bass. 2)Make your music more diverse and varied, or at least change your patterns. Elastica's self-titled album has 4-chord patterns, except they play faster, and the songs aren't much longer than two and a half minutes long (not that I'm comparing BHG to Elastica). 3)Do what you do ""best"", and don't try metal. ""Magna Cum Nada"" is BHG's horrible attempt to make something metal-ish. Stop. The problem with Bloodhound Gang is that they just won't die. People like them somehow, and so they feel compelled to squeeze out more and more crap that gets worse and worse as it progresses, not saying that they were ever good.  Why don't we go through the songs and rate them, shall we?  1. I Hope You Die: See track 15 2. The Inevitable Return of The Great White Dope: Best song by BHG, but still not great. 3. Mama's Boy: See track 15 4. Three Point One Four: See track 15 5. Mope: See track 15 6. Yummy Down On This: See track 15  Catch my drift yet? I don't think I can fully show my displeasure with words. ""1 star , because 0 is not an option"" is exactly correct.  People, if you actually want Bloodhound Gang, copy it from someone. Maybe if they see their record sales go down, they'll actually think about quitting.  p.s. Track 15 is called ""This is Stupid."
5,"Winterheart's Guild(2003). Sonata Arctica's third studio album.  Unlike most people on this site apparently, I DON'T hate power metal. I'm not one who slags the whole genre off upon the discovery of other music like progressive rock and other styles like a lot of people do. When I first came across the genre years ago, I was in heaven. There were a lot of really cool albums by bands like Stratovarius, Labyrinth, Dream Evil, Blind Guardian, Primal Fear, Hammerfall, and others that brought forth the nostalgic sounds of some of my favorite 80s metal bands, though with the benefit of modern production technology. Sure, the subject matter among many of these bands can come across as goofy (almost bearing a Manowar quality at times), but most people seem to miss the point that none of it is meant to be taken seriously.  Of course, my interest in Power Metal has waned since then, but only because after a while, most of the bands I came across started to sound a lot alike with very little to separate them apart from others and make me want to come back for more. It seemed like all the bands had the same machine-gun double bass drumming, Malmsteen-inspired guitar solos, harpsichord keyboard soloing, and Geoff Tate-inspired singing. In short, I needed more _variety_.  Thankfully, bands like Sonata Arctica, Kamelot, and Nightwish are around to show the rest how to make a good, memorable band.  To me, Sonata Arctica sounds like a bigger, better, more realized Stratovarius. I'd known about the band for a while, and I've always loved the song 'Power Of One' off of Silence(2001) which was my first introduction to them. I finally saw one of their albums in the store the other day, and since I'm always looking for good music, I figured ""why not?"". After listening to this album several times now, I can honestly say that this was one of the best purchases I've made all year. While I do like Stratovarius, the problem I had with them is that their albums would have a couple of really outstanding songs on them, followed by several by-the-numbers tracks which they've formulated to death over and over again. Sonata Arctica has no problems like this. This band takes Stratovarius's sound as a main template, and infuses their own creative songwriting melodies and lyrical topics into it, creating a very memorable and varitable collection of songs. Their singer has that familiar Finnish accent, though it's combined with a real passionate performance. The guitarist always seems to play the right riff at the right time, varying it up from soulfull crunchy riffs to great solos that bring Glen Tipton of Judas Priest to mind. Keyboards go from solo-esque battles to goosebump-inducing atmospheric passages that compliment the melodies.  Picking out favorite tracks on this album is a very difficult thing to do, but the ones that seem to stand out the most are 'APBE', 'Gravenimage', 'The Cage', 'Silver Tongue', 'Champaign Bath', and 'Broken'. 'APBE' and 'The Cage' are two of the fast speed metal tracks, while 'Gravenimage' and 'Broken' both sport unique, melodic overtones to them. 'Champaign Bath' is fast, fun metal that takes you for a hellova ride. Then there's two nice ballads to top the album off: 'The Misery' and 'Draw Me'. These ballads thankfully aren't syrup-drenched like a lot of ballads can get. There aren't any bad tracks in the bunch, and there's something to please anyone that is looking for variety.  Replayability: High. Makes for a perfect power metal fix.  WG proved to be a great starting point for me, and I highly suggest anyone else who sees this album in the stores to give it a shot. They also have a new album out, Reckoning Night(2005) as well as two earlier albums, Ecliptica(1999) and Silence, which many consider their best work. If WG is any indication, then I can't wait any longer to hit up on the other albums. One of the lyrics in the song 'Gravenimage' asks ""Can I still recognize a beautiful melody?"". Yes, you certainly can, and you're certainly one of the best bands in the business at it.   Other recommendations: -Any other Sonata Arctica album. ALL are outstanding. (judging by the soundclips) -'Visions' by Stratovarius -'Epica' and 'The Black Halo' by Kamelot -'Oceanborne', 'Wishmaster', and 'Century Child' by Nightwis"
1,I hate this band.THEY WERE THE LEAST RESPECTED GROUP IN THE 70'S.THE ONLY GROUP WHICH MATTERED IN THE 1970'S WAS PINK FLOYD.I JUST CANT UNDERSTAND THAT WHY IN 2006 WOULD PEOPLE WANT TO LISTEN TO THESE TALENTESS DI**HEADS WHEN THERE IS SO MUCH BETTER MUSIC AVAILABLE THAN THIS.GET PEARL JAM'S SELF TITLED ALBUM INSTEAD.BUY THIS STUPID ALBUM IF YOU ARE STILL LIVING IN 1970'S.ZERO STAR
2,"I loved ""Come Away With Me"" the first moment I heard it.  I also had the opportunity to see Norah and her wonderful band in concert ... the experience was absolutely FANTASTIC! I couldn't have asked for a better! So naturally I waited in eager anticipation for her new album ""Feels Like Home"" which after only one listen made me feel narcoleptic.  It was a good thing I didn't try and listen to it while driving.  To be perfectly honest, I haven't listened to it since. She is so talented, I wish this effort had been as successful as the first, but not everyone hits a homerun each time at bat. But I still hold out hope that her next album will be better"
5,"This is without a doubt the best texas music album I've ever heard, and quite possibly my favorite CD I own.  I just don't get tired of it.  There's simply not a weak song on the album, and there's a good variety of upbeat songs as well as slower, more somber ones.  Pick this one up. "
1,"I hate this CD. I have most of the other Chieftan CD's, and their collaboration with other artists has always worked in the past. This collection runs the gamut from mediocre to ludicrous. To paraphrase a line from Spinal Tap:&quot;There's a fine line between clever and stupid.&quot; This one's over the line.  &quot;Tears of Stone&quot; is my current fave"
4,"I saw them open for KISS in 76 and they blew me away. But for some reason I never bought any albums. I never heard them on the radio. I always thought they were  another Skynrd type band but they are NOT! They are just kick butt rock and roll! I love it! I love the live versions so much I wanna get the live album now. Reminds me of Saxon or UFO live. Awesome. I'm sorry I didn't listen to them before. Train TRain, Wishing Well, Queenie and the kickin' Good Morning are just killers! If you think they are just some southern band think again. Highly recommended for any hard blues rock fan. Buy Blackfoot"
5,"The SWEET shock a few of their fans here and jump from bubble-gum to Rock. From the first 30 seconds of track one ""Set Me Free"" for good or bad, you know those days are gone for ever. In the process they acquire an entirely new audience. The SWEET have attained their adolescence. Although they do not have total control (yet) of the final product, they are now penning many of the songs and are breaking free from the nest. This gives the band new energy and motivation which is evident in the final product. As adolescents, gone is the ""goodie two-shoes"" image. The topics now range from fast cars (Rebel Rouser) to bi-sexual women (AC-DC). In the 70's the ""moral majority"" still ruled over freedom of expression, so these subjects are dealt with some subtlety and an occasional bit of humour.  Oh yes the music...I could decipher the music for pages but I'll let YOU do it. Someone once wrote that SWEET was a fly by night, 3 chord churning and ""very limited talent wise"" band. Alright then ""smarty pants"", compare Pat Benatar's cover of the song ""No You Don't"" to the original SWEET version. Compare the drums, guitar and vocals. Then you can make-up your own mind...   GREAT STUFF!!! An excellent deal with all those extra tracks."
5,"""Berlin"",  which was Reed's follow-up to his highly succesful ( both musically and commercially ) 1972 album ""Transformer"", showcases a radical change in Reed's direction. Whereas ""Transformer"" was a mostty light and musically catchy album, ""Berlin"" is a more complex and darker album; both musically and lyrically.   No tracks have the commercial appeal which characterized many tracks on ""Transformer"", and the album contains no new hit-singles. The album works much better to be listened to as a whole, and only few tracks are suited for ""Best of"" compilations. Songs like ""Caroline Says"" and ""How Do Think it Feels"" would be the most obvious selections to put out. This doesn't mean that this is not good album; on the contrary; it may be his artistically most  successful. Musically it's very varied in style and instrumentation.   The ""Berlin"" theme seems to have influenced the arrangements of the two opening tracks; especially ""Lady Day"" ( Kurt Weil ).  The songs are generally longer than on Reed's two previous albums, but you are never bored when listening to the album; and once you have gotten to know the songs, you'll notice that it is really a very melodic album, with no unimportant tracks.  This is Reed's Dark Masterpiece"
2,"Gun in hand, formula of flesh and bury me were 3 excellent songs but the rest of the tracks on the album just sounded like filler. not really my kind of stuff i guess"
2,"Despite breaking through with the Kanye West-assisted This Way in 2004, Dilated Peoples have created a niche for themselves, devoid of mainstream hip-hop's frills and the eccentric creativity of the left-field. Their once-commendable stoicism now translates as banality, not aided by this lacklustre set, filled with beats that Eminem would be ashamed of. The malaise even extends to some very ordinary scratching from the usually impeccable DJ Babu, while it takes guest Talib Kweli to deliver the LP's best verse on Kindness For Weakness"
5,"I have had this videocassette for years and its so worn I'm so glad to finally get a CD!  Jewel's voice is beautiful and some of the classics like Joy to the World and O Little Town of Bethlehem are the best versions I have ever heard.  I could have done without the non-traditional songs which don't quite fit into the holiday arrangement or match the beauty of her voice but its well worth the purchase for Gloria, O Holy Night and Ave Maria. If you like to sing along, I highly recommend it."
4,"The Alice Cooper Band's second album sees the band still recording for Frank Zappa's label.  The music starts to turn in the direction of the material that would later make them famous.  No real macabre stuff yet, but the album is definitely a progression from their first one.  The album was produced by David Brigs who is probably best known for working with Neal Young.  The opening track, ""Mr. And Misdemeanor"" has always been a favorite of mine and a great example of Alice's talent for playing on words.  ""Shoe Salesman"", ""Below Your Means"", ""Return Of The Spiders"", and the short but cool ""Refrigerator Heaven"" are all good tunes.  The finale of ""Beautiful Flyaway"" and ""Lay Down And Die, Goodbye"" is also a great way to end things.  The Alice Cooper band would be signed to Capitol and hit the big time with their next release.  ""Easy Action"" would be a strong stepping stone to get to that point. "
4,"If you are looking for a disc with first-rate interpretations of some of the standards in brass band literature, this recording (and its somewhat more refined Volume 1) begs your attention.  All of the performances are extremely clean and precise, and the technical requirements of these works are often extensive.  There are the moments of overly sentimental playing and wobbly vibrato that was so off-putting to Vaughan Williams in his Henry V, but nothing outside of the standard practice in most British Brass Bands. "
2,first of All KRS-One is One of the Greatest Rappers&Story-Tellers Ever&Ain't nobody out now in Rap Can even Hold His Shoe Laces when He breaks things down.having said that&understanding He didn't fully want this Album out He still hasn't knocked me out with a Album all the way through in way over a Decade.He has had some tight Jams&of course His Flow still will just leave you dizzy but the Music&Subject matter are pretty much the same&He hasn't challenged His Full powers as a MC in quite some time.He still has the Words&Flow to Roll you over but Albums like this&others of recent time just don't even begin to do this Man Justice when you remember&Grew up on His Best stuff.but regardless I'll always listen to Him.He truly changed&Flipped the Game
1,"First of all, THE DELIVERY MAN isn't that much of an album.  Why would anyone want a bonus disc of bad remixes or live versions???  You folks are right - this reissuing business is just plain stupid.  I've been a Costello fan for over 25 years, but I'll tell you what, my collection stopped at the Ryko reissues!  As for the stuff he's put out since the Universal switch - I've burned them all off the copies that my local library system gets (at least one person on their buying staff is a Costello fan - ain't I lucky?).  Sorry E, but I spent too much of my (and other people's) money on buying these ""elusive"" rare tracks - that are still in print all these years later.  I'll believe this stuff is rare when Rhino ceases the bonus discs and just reissues the old catalog in their original 11-20 song discs.  In the meantime, I've got a box of old Costello 45s and picture sleeves for sale.  Any takers"
1,"This is the worst lp in recording history.  The covers are embarassingly bad, and especially their cover of Lou Reed's ""Sweet Jane"" which is down right hideous and I'd be suprised if Lou Reed wouldn't beat the living daylights out of all three of these losers if he ever saw them.  If you think Grand Funk Railroad covering the Stones' ""Gimmie Shelter"" was ridiculous, that's nothing; this is far, far worse.  As for their big hit single, ""Smoking in the Boys' Room"" here's a newsflash:IT'S a NOVELTY song, nothing more.  The rest of the songs are ""me wanna hump you"" caveman songs ineptly play that make Bad Company sound sophisticated.  I'm sorry Cub Koda died young, but there is a silver lining in that cloud: HE'S NOT RECORDING ANYMORE.  Rated 1 Star because ZERO wasn't available.  Avoid at all costs.  Unless you want a ten dollar mini frisbee that comes with a jewel case"
5,Doesn't get anymore classic than this ! Two legends just sitting down and doing what they do best
5,"There is mention of As Wichita Falls, so Falls Wichita Falls in the movie The Ice Harvest...does anyone know if there is definite connection between this album which is much older and the film which played around Christmas 2005? I am not big Metheny fan == was looking for something else when I ran across this album.."
4,"Really the thing that gets me is not Dolphy's playing at all.  It's Bobby Hutcherson's.  He is a master on this album, proving solo after solo that his taste is something to be reckoned with.  If you are a fan of the vibraphones, and want to hear them used the exact opposite of the way that the Modern Jazz Quartet used them, grab your keys, walk out of your door, lock your door, walk down the path in front of your house, out of your front yard, shutting the small latch on your gate, get in your car and go to a music store.  Once there, head to the jazz section and get this album.  Or, you know, click BUY.  Either way.  It'll work"
2,This band is more punk than rock with only somewhat easy flowing songs
2,"Wow! What a horrible album! Its tracks are filled with a bunch of predictable outcomes and very cheesy vocals. The only two tunes that I have found to be interesting were Eleven and Sydney. Eleven is actually my favourite tune. Gabriel & Dresden had the potential as they made some quality productions - although most of them were a bit too commercial, but still quility - throughout years 2002-2004. Then they released the awesome, their best in my opinion, track Arcadia. After the release of Arcadia, I just thought it couldn't get better than this - an awsome production without any of that cheesiness that you would find in their earlier works. But the reality was that from that point on it just went downhill for these two. And this album just proves it. All of these tracks are well done and finished, but too finished and too uncreative. It actually didn't surprise me after hearing their Essential Mix back in spring. Basically they have great production skills but absolutely no ideas. I would recommend just buying track Eleven on 12"" or mp3"
4,"I've always loved the way John Mayer takes his songs to the acoustic side of things and this album highlights that talent. The songs have a different feel to them. They don't sound as deep and emotional as the full orchestrated Continuum versions, but (with the exception of Waiting on the world to Change - which sounds identical to the Continuum version) both Belief and Slow Dancing (the two strongest on this album) have a more personal sound to them.  The production is spotless and it sounds as though the album was recorded in the studio as opposed to live, and result is a definite additon to your John Mayer collection.  The only fault I have is that there isn't a longer track listing"
5,8 years later and this album still rules. this is by far the best children of bodom album and hatebreeder comes in second with tokyo warhearts. don't waste your time with new bodom if you haven't heard the older stuff yet especially something wild because you will be missing out on what COB really are. Deadnight Warrior and Touch Like (the) Angel of Death amazing
4,"this disc is blazing but not quite as deep as Romantic Warrior.but still Chick,Al,Stanley&amp;Lenny give up the Rock,Jazz&amp;Funk and Fuse a strong brew here.Celebration Suite Part 1&amp;2 take this disc to another  Level.the Playing is very Intense&amp;tight.when folks say so&amp;so is one  of the Greatest Guitarist of All-Time they have to Include AL DiMeola. his  solos ain't no joke.Lenny solos and they are banging.Stanley is incredible  as usual&amp;Chick Corea has no-Limits"
2,"The mixing on some tracks is awful, and at one point, vocals are lost altogether on The Rascals track. I love this music -- the soundtrack of my college days -- so having it on one disc for traveling (I commute 50 miles round trip every day) is great, but the quality could be lots better"
5,"THE END OF THE INNOCENCE is Don Henley's other best solo album, along with BUILDING THE PERFECT BEAST. The title song, like ""The Boys Of Summer"" from the previous album, made me realize that looking good for my favorite actresses was more important than attending food-related reunions at my old school, especially since most of the staff I knew are gone and many of the changes there have not been for the better. ""I Will Not Go Quietly"" and ""New York Minute"" made me realize that looking at photos of attractive female celebrities is a good way to inspire myself to avoid an individual I've had issues with BEFORE I do myself in over it, whereas ""Little Tin Gods"" and ""If Dirt Were Dollars"" skewer hypocritical preachers and gossip columnists, respectively, and ""The Heart Of The Matter"", like the title song, is about letting go, whether of a lost love, a grudge, or your past. Overall, THE END OF THE INNOCENCE is an album with great music and multilayered lyrical messages. The fact that Henley believes that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indonesia on drug-smuggling charges was wrongfully convicted makes this album an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience "
5,"Its doubtful that there have been two jazz musicians more suited to record together than Ben Webster and Sweets Edison. Alumni of the Ellington and Basie bands respectively, these two mainstream swing players have marvelous  chemistry on this session. The charts are perfect vehicles for Webster's  warm tone and silky phrasing as well as Edison's blues-ridden melodic style  that matured in the mid and late 1950's. Most of the tunes swing hard  anchored by a solid Basie-esque rhythm section. You'll wear this one out"
5,"I have found that anything that Jegg Golub does is absolutely wonderful. He has managed to take artist like Eric Claptan, Johnny Lang, Stevie Ray Von, BB king, Seagar and the list goes on, and gives you alittle of  everyones style all in one song and then mixes his own style in to boot.  All of his work is a must hear. If you like soul, blues, and jazz. here ya  go. Brenda Burnet"
4,"This has 4 stone cold rock classics on it - Hotel California, New Kid in Town, Life in the Fast Lane and Victim of Love. For these songs alone the album deserves 4 stars. The rest I can pretty much do without. I'm not a big fan of the slower songs sung by Don Henley, such as Wasted Time and The Last Resort - he sounds much better singing the grittier rock songs. The guitar work throughout is amazing - i still get chills listening to the guitar solo on H.C. even after all this time. Felder and Walsh sound great together. I hear they're recording a new album for release late this year and it's a shame that Felder is no longer in the band. Anyone who plays guitar like he does is going to be missed, if not by the band then definitely by us listeners"
5,"Very nice collection of mid to late 60's top 40 tracks. First time true stereo on ""Love Is All Around"" and ""Whiter Shade Of Pale"", and even the ones you may have already sound better than ever. I might have left off ""Keep On Dancing"" for something that hasn't popped up on a dozen other compilations, but that's a minor gripe. I don't think that any oldies collector will be disappointed with this CD.  Like the other guy said, just buy it. "
5,"Bach wrote very, very few variation compositions like the ""Goldberg Variations,"" but the one's he wrote are most memorable and monumental.  Early in his career, he wrote a magnificant ""Aria with Variations in the Italian Manner"" (BWV989).  Its repeating aria at the end along with the alternating fast/bright and slow/contemplative variations foreshadowed a model in these so-called Goldberg Variations  - one of the towering 'summation works' Bach wrote late in his life at Leipzig.   With a full quiver of splendid recordings of Bach's keyboard music, it is not hard to believe that Angela Hewitt is the top-selling musical artist for the British Hyperion label.  And this recording of her personal favorite Golderg Variations is another worthwhile CD in the series.  Angela Hewitt's Goldbergs - and really all her Bach or Couperin in general - may be most simplistically characterized as having a more gentle, graceful and heartfelt style.  She particularly excells on bringing out the joyful rhythms in the many Baroque-era 'dances' and as well as the inherent songfulness within the music.  Technically, her smooth-as-silk long legato line, tasteful ornamental infusions, and intelligent progression all combine to create a delightful experience with Bach as heard in this fine recording.    Additionally, Hewitt is a master tonal colorist and is not shy to tactfully use the pedals and nuances of the modern piano to create a greater richness in the music - while taking care to avoid blurring her individual lines.  Accordingly, she elects a wide dynamic range for this recording to elicit maximum expressivity.  Where a pianist like Glenn Gould goes for maximum clarity of parts by completely avoiding the pedal (creating razor-sharp articulations within a very-forward recorded sound), Hewitt strives to balance crisp articulation with tonal beauty through such pianistic nuances as well as through a somewhat-spacious (but clear) recording ambiance.  Her creativity in ornamentation and well-chosen shifts of tempo in the repeats (which she observes here) adds stylistic interest - but without straying too far from Bach's musical intentions.   In comparison to other Goldberg recordings (such as Perhahia's Award-Winning disc), Angela Hewitt's readings here seems to possess a more introspective, pensive tone and mood overall. Perhaps in the back of her mind she is tempering her expression in light of the legend that Bach wrote these pieces for his student Goldberg to play at night to help his employer, the insomniac Count Keyserling, pass the time during his sleepness nights.  Hewitt's expressivity in the opening and closing Aria is as expected, thoughtful and beautiful.  But, in the famous 25th ""Black Pearl"" Variation, she creates a somewhat veiled atmosphere with a slower tempo not unlike a funeral march.  Personally, I felt it a bit too heavy rather than the more poignant and optimistic mood of Perahia - but such is art and individual preference.  Contrastingly, in the brilliant fast variations, Miss Hewitt brings an ebulient clarity and precision to the music that is refreshing to mind and spirit.  But, it is not the fully unleashed joy that Murray Perahia finds (in movements like the first variation) which overflow with a special vivacity.  But Hewitt's readings here overall are no less enjoyable or admirable as such nuances are often purely personal.  I tend to prefer Perahia's sparkling version on a sunny morning and Hewitt's more contemplative recording when reading late at night.  Other notable Goldberg recordings come from the Bach legend Rosalyn Tureck whose recordings are often a model for any serious student of the piano. Hungarian pianist Andras Schiff has also recorded some gorgeous Bach that often has a similar ""sweetness"" of style as Hewitt.  As for Glenn Gould, his landmark 1955/1982 recordings rightfully caused a stirring in the music world and have a striking individuality and brilliantly clear articulation of voices (assuming you don't mind his intermittent humming and the less-than-perfect sound quality).  Many others have also given great performances.  Hewitt's Goldberg CD received strong ratings from from many of the top reviewers like Penguin Guide and Gramophone and stands with a few others among the finer recordings.  ClassicsToday was a bit more critical, giving this CD a rating of 8/10 for Artistic Quality and 9/10 for Sound Quality (noting a tendency for emotive restraint in some variations).  I mostly agree with this last (8/10) assessment - out of Hewitt's Bach discography, I found her Goldbergs very enjoyable but just not quite as magical as her others.  But, an additional highlight of this Hyperion CD is surely the superbly annotated notes revealing some history of this music and Ms. Hewitt's musical insights and approaches to each of the 30 variations.  The notes alone might make Hewitt's CD preferable to others if you already have a version you really like.  All-in-all, a most attractive and admirable recording (4.5 stars); but, like other reviewers and Gramophone conclude, Perahia's sparkling version (5 stars) strikes me as very special and takes top honors here in my opinion"
1,"With the exception of Missy, and Lil kim track, this whole cd will make a great coaster at best. The only who can truly enjoy this album is someone who has a one track mind for partyin' only. This is no hip hop compilation. Straight dance to the fullest. Pop for the most part. And tracks of hits that i didn't even no was hits, by a rapper almost no one cares about. Even though I do like some of what he puts out but still, addin yourself on hits album just make people diss him more"
5,"I agree with other reviewers here -- much of the music on the CD is simply supplemental to the film, is forgetable, nothing really stands out, there is a lack of melody.  Only one track (# 14) ""My Name is Lincoln"" -- stands apart, offering a theme, melody, choir and resolution -- it is a signature bit of composing that, for me, is really worth the price of the CD"
5,"I have to say that I prefer Handel's Tamerlano for musical reasons. However, Vivaldi's opera on the same subject is very enjoyable and entertaining. Like it has been said of the operas of Haydn, Vivaldi's operas are not great operas, but they do contain great music.  Europa Galante, directed from the 1st violin by Fabio Biondi, is in great form and I've never heard them play better. I have their older recording of Handel's opera Poro, and I enjoyed that one, too.  The singers here are an excellent ensemble. I like the dark and expressive voice of Ildebrando D'Arcangelo - he was also marvellous as Leporello in Gardiner's Don Giovanni. David Daniels is fantastic, as usual, and he is possibly the best operatic countertenor in the world at the moment. Patrizia Ciofi is best heard and not seen - sweet voice coming from a madwoman (check out the DVD!). Vivica Genaux has been hyped to within a centimetre of her life recently. She has a nice flexible mezzo voice. A little too much vibrato for my tastes and she looks like a chipmunk when she attacks coloratura passages. Marijana Mijanovic sings well - she was excellent as the neurotic Penelope in the Christie / L.A.F. DVD of Monteverdi's Il Ritorno d'Ulisse in patria. She is alarmingly thin - possible health problems? She doesn't engage with the conductor or orchestra at all in the DVD - the only singer who doesn't. Elina Garanca looks beautiful (and healthy!) and sings beautifully. She has a lovely contralto voice. I hope I see and hear more from this artist in the future.   I am not a big fan of Vivaldi's operas - I enjoy them as collections of arias. I wonder how well Bajazet worked on stage? I'd love to have a DVD of this production, I would like to see how a Vivaldi opera works on stage. Vivaldi's operas don't have imaginative scorings and the orchestral passages are fairly prosaic. A lot of what goes on in the Vivaldi operas I've heard (I have a few in my CD collection) is pretty routine. However, I am open minded on the subject and I would like to see how well a Vivaldi opera works on stage."
5,"Melanie White and other reviewers have wondered what else out there might be similar to ""Appalachia Waltz."" I highly recommend Oliver Schroer's double-disc ""O2"". Same fusion of folk fiddle idiom and classical violin. In places astoundingly brilliant. Lovers of Bach will see many influences here (yet I wouldn't call Schroer's work derivative.) In the liner notes, Schroer talks about making his work not just polyphonic but also fractal--funny thing is, the more you listen, the more ""fractal"" it sounds. Unbelievable."
5,"A wonderful CD with the power to thoroughly relax even the most stressed-out people. Easy enough for background playing during dinner or a conversation, and serious enough to be full of magic when listening to it  exclusively. Great buy at a great price"
1,Beef is an excellent source of protei
1,It is laughable to read some of these other reviews. But whats not funny is how bad 50 Cent is. He is the worst rapper of all time a total disgrace to hip hop music. He has no love for the music only for the money. I don't know how he sells so many records but that just shows how many people don't know real music
5,"Carpenter really knew what he was doing when he got Walker to help with the score.  Makes super background music for Quake II.  The sounds are FAR more detailed than in EFNY.  It's the bomb, as they say.  I've had it for  two months, and I still get a kick out of the main theme and the motorcycle  chase.  Kudos, Carpenter"
5,"i had a very colicky baby from 2 weeks old to 10 weeks old and this was the best cd of all the ones i tried (classical, lullabye, ocean sounds, television, etc) to calm my baby and most importantly, to keep him sleeping longer. the last track was his favorite, the sound of the rain. he sleeps so much longer now that i play that track on ""repeat"" all night long. and i can get things done during his naps because the rain sound covers up the noise of me in the kitchen, etc. And, when he is really cranky and there's nothing else i can do for him, i can put him down in his bed and play the whole cd from start to finish and it calms him and puts him to sleep 75% of the time, which is a huge improvement from other attempts."
5,"I've never written a review for anything (I'm pretty sure). It's just like: ""Whatever"" to me, but I read some guy's review of Keep it Like a Secret by Built To Spill (by the way: couldn't recommend that album any more highly. Buy it now.). I lost my train of thought, but  Here's what I'm getting at:  This album changed my life. Not even kidding.  Besides, maybe, Giant Steps, this is the most important piece of music of all time. Of all the time in my life, of course. I don't know about yours.  Do me a favor and pick it up now.  Seriously, I couldn't even quantify or qualify the effect this album has on me with words or numbers or any other means of expression beyond this: This album changed my life.  Seriously, you don't even get it.  God man, I've been listening to this album since I was in second grade. My all time favorite.  Buy Ruby Vroom, too. Stay away from El Oso. And Mike Doughty's solo stuff. I mean, get it if you want. I don't care.   Just go read some Soul Coughing lyrics. Just take like, 2 minutes out of your day. You're not even doing anything important right now. Are you? No.  http://scug.net/, man. Thats all. Just go there. Read some of the words. Look at the pictures.  Seriously, you don't even get it. I took the liner notes out of the case (which I lost) and taped them to my wall. I'm not even kidding.   sigh  aklsjdfl;asjkdfkl;asdj   -wilso"
1,"I am so dissapointed in this CD. I bought it because I have ""Blow By Blow"" and ""Jeff Beck with the Jan Hammer Group"" and I love those CDs. This crap sounds like somebody that heard those recordings, practiced for one week and tried to do an imitation of them. I don't like one cut on the entire CD. I only gave it one star because I couldn't find a way to give it less."
2,"judging by the clips offered from amazon, this cd sounded like it could be as good as gba material, but i was dissapointed after the first spin, and i haven't put it back in since. It's not bad stuff, just that the jams are  lacking in creativity, and the true funk feel is missing. Try Greyboy  allstars(who are the BEST live), or try the next level in jambads: PHISH"
5,I love every kind of music and I recently was introduced to Tom Waits. My faviorte genre is metal but I cant stop listening to this guy. His voice is amazing and all his songs are wonderful. Pasties And A G-String (At The Two O'Clock Club) and Step Right Up are my faviorte on this cd. I own a few other cds by Waits and I have yet to hear this guy make a bad song
2,"This performer deserves all the latitude necessary, as she may yet develop into a relevant, insightful, and original interpreter of the music she offers. I truly hope she does not choose to compete with Eliot Fisk in the Indy-500 or the 24-Hours of Le Mans. Based on the samples, I won't be buying this CD as I can program my computer to play just as fast or even faster, and just as clear. Instead, I recommend the Frank Bungarten recording (also available on Amazon). But Ana Vidovic does show a lot of promise, and deserves encouragement"
5,"Un poco triste que Reyli ya no forme parte de ELEFANTE. En este disco nos muestra (aun mas) su gran talento pero como solista.  Sus canciones: ""Amor del bueno"", ""Desde que llegaste"" y ""Calma"" son hermosas.  Y quien no ha escuchado el tema musical, ""La descarada"", de la muy popular telenovela Rubi? Comprenlo hoy"
2,Aphrodite must have been preoccupied when he mixed this one. For the most part the tracks drag on with no end in sight or build toward some invisible (and unmelodic) climax. There are a few with powerful beats and creative touches such as tracks 14 featuring Jungle Brothers and 13 featuring N.W.A. But for the most part the rappers take center stage and Aphrodite doesn't add much. If you really want to sample his talent buy his self titled CD
1,"I List Hezekiah Walker , Donnie McClurckin and Micah Stampley as gospel vocalist with the most range and you hear how much range he has at the end of lift him up, he is almost singing soprano. This album takes awhile to get used to.There is a Mix between live songs and studio songs, different from all of the rest of Walkers' albums.My favorite song is lift him up, and im pretty much satisfied with the album because it lifts me up when i listen to it.I was  blessed to see Hezekiah Walker live and he sung lift him up, ive played in my car ever since and its hard not to shout off of it.I must say I like the live recordings better because i love live instruments .The one thing i must say is that Hezekiah Walker does not dissapoint and his music is about ministry and not about all the technical stuff that musicians and song writers worry about. Hez carries an anointing nobody else carries, he is a pastor first and a singer second, his albums are not about lyrics there about ministry and lifting up jesus.so if you are someone that cares more about lyrics than anointing you might want to  try someone else whose anointing is not as powerful as Hezekiah Walker"
4,"As ballad pop goes, Journey is there. These are the songs which were played at proms throughout the 1980s. Filled with romance, emotional passion and Steve Perry's unrelenting voice, Journey's ""The Essential Journey"" are a mix of hard, mild and melodic pop rock.   Occasionally, the band would turn out mediocre music, like ""Girl Can't Help It,"" but most is still worth listening to. ""Be Good to Yourself"" sounds like a bad movie soundtrack song, and is not worthy of this otherwise amazing CD.  There are two disks, with more music than the average listener is familiar with, and only hardcore fans with know. A few hits are missing, leaving a real best-of CD still out there.  Journey was a pop band: Simple lyrics without a heavy message. Distinguishing them was their willingness to step out of the known musical formulas. Club music was coming into its own in the 1980s, with DJs sampling and mixing. Their music doesn't sample well, and they risked being a radio-only band. As their hit list grew from ""Lovin' Touchin' Squeezin'"" into a rich repertoire, their concerts became packed into stadiums. Those are the songs here.   It is 1980s music in every sense of the term, but better than just as music from the period, just like James Taylor is better than just being a musician from the 1970s. I fully recommend, ""The Essential Journey"" by Journey.   Anthony Trendl  editor, HungarianBookstore.co"
5,"This is a great CD with the Dance Movements being my favorite.  UNT plays wonderully, intonation is great.  Highly recommended band literature"
5,"This album is fantastic.  I can't really compare it to other Melvins albums since they all have something different about them, but take my word for it that this one is great.  This one is unique from every other Melvins release for two reasons:  1.  They have a second drummer on this thing, and  2.  There are TONS of vocal harmonies in this album.  My thoughts on both:  The two drummers thing, awesome, the fills and solos are amazing, I never thought they'd find a way to make Dale Crover's work even better, turns out they did, they had another amazingly talented guy drum with him.  Its astounding.  If you play the drums, you need to hear this album.  The vocal harmonies thing, really cool too.  It makes the sound very unique, gives it another layer.   All that said, the album itself is also unlike the other Melvins albums in that most of it is really fast.  The Melvins are characteristically famous for their sludgey, slow sound.  They still toss out a few slow numbers here, but by and large its chock full of incredibly intelligent, speedy metal songs.  And they're awesome!  The Melvins sound great playing fast!  The intro to ""The Hawk"" just TEARS!!!  I don't even know how to compose my thoughts about this album other than to say it carries the fine Melvins tradition of doing something to vastly alter their sound on every album, and also, its fantastic.  It rocks so hard.  I mean, if you thought The Maggot was an awesome fistfull of metal, check out A Senile Animal, its even better.  I should also point out that this is probably their best starter album.  Meaning that if you don't own any Melvins albums and never heard of them, this one is the best place to start.  I know it's not their classic sludge sound, but the Melvins are not an accessable band.  Their music, while intelligent, awesome, and incredibly powerful, takes a while to figure out.  You have to give the Melvins a good couple of listens before it just sort of clicks in your head and you realize how brilliant these guys can be.  Take their self titled album (or ""Lysol"" to the diehards), for example.  Its a great brilliant Melvins album; one of their best, as most fans will tell you.  But if you were trying to expose someone who's never heard of the Melvins to their music, you wouldn't dare start them out with Lysol, it would go right over their heads.  So thats why its nice to see a Melvins album like ""A Senile Animal"" come out, becuase the intelligenece and the power is still there, but overall its a much easier experience to wrap your brain around.  So thank you, Melvins, for making yet another wonderful, unique, challenging-yet-still-accessable (not to mention HEAVY) album.  And those of you reading this not knowing a thing about the Melvins, buy this album.  If you're a metal fan and you have half a brain, you'll love it.  Then pick up The Maggot, Stoner Witch, and Houdini.  Now that you realize that this is one of the best musical acts still performing today, go for the golden material with Gluey Portch Treatments, Bullhead, and Lysol.    As a side point, how can Buzz still be doing this?  Its been like two decades and he's STILL making some of the best metal riffs in existance.  How can you go that long, putting out album after album, and still be tossing out all these fantastic, wonderfully heavy metal riffs left and right?  Its inhuman"
2,"Hate to admit it but this just isn't very good.  Been a fan since 'Slowhand' so i've been frequently disappointed and underwhelmed by Clapton, but this is just amazing.  This has everything going for it but it just doesn't come together.  The featured review by 'Woomer' mirrors my feelings that nothing since 'From the Cradle' has been worthwhile barring 'Riding with the King' and that was helped immensely by King himself.  Toss this onto the heap along with 'Reptile' and 'Pilgrim'"
1,"Unless one considers ""Planet Waves,"" Dylan's 1974 studio album with the Band playing backup, to be a Band album, ""Cahoots"" has no competition for the title of the worst Band album ever. Yes, the first two tracks are good (""Life is a Carnival"" - great rhythms, great horns, OK lyrics; and Dylan's ""Masterpiece"" -- does nothing for me, but I understand many people love it), but they are available on other compilations, so the reason to shell out for ""Cahoots"" has to reside in the remaining tracks if anywhere, and they are AWFUL. The songs, that is, not the performances. The boys sing and play as well as ever, but their efforts -- particularly some fine Danko vocals and Hudson horn playing -- are wasted on songs that are utterly tuneless, charmless and brainless. There is not a single memorable musical phrase on tracks 3-11. Nor do the bonus tracks on this reissue rescue the enterprise: all are either available elsewhere in equivalent or superior versions or are unworthy of inclusion on anything (a RADIO COMMERCIAL?!). Save your money for any of the worthier products of this wonderful group of musicians"
5,"The fact that this CD includes the stunningly-beautiful ballad ""Miracles Need Wings To Fly"" should provide incentive enough to buy it. This great compilation brings most of Teena's greatest romantic ballads together for the first time--and at a budget price. Given her enormous talent, it's (almost) incredible that Teena has rarely gotten the mainstream recognition she naturally deserves. If you can only get one Teena Marie CD this is definitely THE one"
5,"I'm probably looking for something different than proper techno-heads, but I found that the entire album is good dancing music (Latin...think Cha Cha or Samba if you're REALLY athletic) or at least fun to listen to. My favorite by far is #5, of course"
2,"This time around, we get a fair amount of 7"" versions and edits. Track times:  1. Born to be Alive (6:05) (12"" edit) 2. rock your baby (6:26) 3. you make me feel mighty real (5:29) 4. don't leave me this way (5:43) 5. macho man (5:14) 6. in the bush (3:35) (7"") 7. hot shot (3:34) (7"") 8. bad girls (4:59) (album version) 9. he's the greatest dancer (6:15) 10. planet rock (6:24) 11. swearin to god (4:04) 12. this time baby (5:53)(edit"
5,"This is my favorite of her two Albums and one of my favorite CDs in my entire collection. I love devitional music, and this album is totally upbeat with tastefully interwoven Flamenco guitar, Indian Percussion, Tablas, among more modern sounding back-beats, and dance grooves. Perfect for meditation, Yoga, and even Just Getting Inspired. To me this Album has a whole lot of Aries/Libra Balance about it. It has a very FREEDOM LOVE feeling about it and yet it is very clear, balanced and awake. This album, I hated the first time I listened to it! So I sold it. The second time I listened to it, I was absoluetly shocked to Love it, and It is now one of my most favorite albums, and more frequently listened to, without ever getting sick of it. Maybe that is how I love it so much. Somehow this album merged with me in a non-conscious way, and totally snuck up on me! Wow, A very magical abum of peace and freedom in Devotional Modern Style~ very  Very Highly recommended."
1,"This is sabotage rather than a tribute to Tupac.  This doesn't do him justice.  Listening to this CD, I thought of ""This is Spinal Tap"" - the part where they have the miniature version of stonehenge, and everyone is looking around thinking ""what the hell is going on?""  That must have been how Tupac felt at this show.  The part of the CD where you can actually hear someone flipping through ""all eyez on me"" trying to find the right song...that was when I knew this CD was crap.  Tupac put great pride into the quality and sound of his work.  This is an abomination.  Well, what more can you say?  Death Row needed a little extra holiday bling, I guess.... My recommendation - don't buy it.  You might as well just listen to All Eyez on Me and sing along. "
1,"22 stellar reviews of this, I am flabbergasted.  I looked this up because we were talking about it on a messageboard:  patrick posted this on Aug 25th, 2006 at 09:59:53 am this looks and sounds ill in a conceptual way, it doesn't sound like Steppenwolf, right?  Peter**********IsDead posted this on Aug 25th, 2006 at 05:56:23 pm Steppenwolf have a few bangers, c'mon  and one of the best LP covers ever - [IMAGE]  i cant find a good size pic of it but if you own it you know PERFECT 70s dirtbag vibe on the cover  the_real_***** posted this on Aug 25th, 2006 at 07:11:16 pm that Steppenwolf-Monster LP has songs called Fag, Monster and Suicide, has the best cover art ever and it still totally sucks.  Negative*** posted this on Aug 25th, 2006 at 07:56:21 pm I was all stoked when I picked up monster at a garage sale. I owned it for less then 3 hours before I put it in the trash. The cover is GREAT though.  youth****** posted this on Aug 25th, 2006 at 09:18:05 pm Those song titles (Steppenwolf) are incredible beyond belief.   diffrn't strokes I gues"
5,a Solid Title here because not only are the Songs Here Very Soulful&Timeless but the Artists Featured here are whose who that Brought Soul Music out.back in a time Period when it was a Honored to Be Called SoulFul.these Songs Represent a time Period that Brought out the Best in R&B Radio
4,"Like others have said this cd is much more harder than City of Evil, and a little harder than Waking the Fallen, but still is a good cd. If your a new fan of A7X, I would suggest getting City Of Evil first, but don,t overlook this cd"
5,"Mid Eighties SST indie rock classic! This was the very first Sonic Youth album I owned. I got the vinyl in 87 at the age of 15 and it blew my mind and has ever since! The best song on the album in my opinion, and one of Sonic Youth's best songs period is ""Expressway to yr Skull,"" aka ""Madonna, Sean and Me,"" aka  ""The crucifixion of Sean Penn."" Whatever title you prefer, this song is a beautiful, powerful masterpiece that hits you in the soul every time. It's the most special melodic guitar masterpiece I have ever heard. Chiming scree infused with bliss, It builds to a mind melting crescendo and goes completely over the top, then the way the bass, drums and guitar work together into the mind bending recovery is aural art for sure. If you are lucky enough to hear it live you are in for a religous experience. On the vinyl it ended side 2 with a locked groove, meaning that when your turntable needle reached the end of the song instead of running out and ending it went around in a circle, playing the droning end of the song forever or until you turn it off.  While ""Expressway"" is a highlight, the rest of the album is awesome as well. Lyrically and sonically one of the things the sonics were into at the time this was recorded was the psychology and mythos surrounding the manson family and that era,  but that is only one aspect of this album. Another interesting thing about this album is the atmosphere it creates; many of the songs are different from one another sonically, yet the album is cohesive. Songs like ""In the Kingdom #19,"" with its narrative style and crazy stuff going on in the background evoking thoughts of D.Boon's tragic death, and ""Marilyn Moore,"" and ""Shadow of a Doubt"" just transport you atmospherically. I have recommended this album to many new listeners of SY, some find that they don't like it as much as ""Sister"" at first, because many of the songs aren't as ""immediately accessible"" as the gems of that album,  but with more listens it rewards them, it grows on them and they like it as much or more. Bublegum is a cover, I believe of an old Kim Fowley song and was not on the original release, but was a B-side (of the Starpower single if I remember correctly) added in the CD age. It seems somewhat out of place, especially following expressway. In any event, this recording is one of SY's best, and in my opinion one of the best period. Buy it, it's magical. "
5,"I loved this album when I first heard it in 1993. Since then, nothing Blues Traveler has created can compare, really. It all pales in comparison. For the best Blues Traveler you'll ever hear (although it would be nice if that weren't the case), get this CD"
5,"Without the soulful voice of Richard Manuel, this album would be drowning in MOR. But he lifts the music into an indescribably emotional area - Right as Rain, Georgia on my mind particularly. He performed almost the same miracle on Northern Lights, Southern Cross. Maybe Islands contains markedly inferior songs and some lacklustre performances, but it is nowhere near as bad as it has been painted. Listen to Richard..."
2,"While I purchased the CD for the title song, I was a little disappointed in the rest of the CD. I guess I didn't know the group's repertoire as well as I thought"
2,"I have tested this CD several times and the results came out the same: I still could not sleep. It must work for some, based on the other reviews, but I found the melodies distracting if not annoying."
2,"I was very excited to own this album knowing that this was a jazztronica album from one of the ECM masters. After struggling to listen to this album several times I have to say Molvaer would do better to stick to the more straight ahead, or perhaps find another producer for such outings. The electronic textures and ambience are fine, and the playing is nothing less than you would expect. Really it's just the beats that make this album unlistenable to me. Extremely cheesy and extremely cliche. My friend commented to me that it reminds him of a 90's movie soundtrack. I think that's about right. Molvaer is a great player, but he's a bit out of touch with some of the genres he was hoping to capture on this record. For jazztronica I would go with Dave Douglas' ""Freak In"" or the aforementioned E.S.T"
2,"2 and a half stars.  This is not an accurate representation of Bay Area Hip-Hop. It's a mediocre attempt in trying to appeal to the mainstream audience. Bay Area artists that signed major deals never made an album that was creatively better than their independent releases. Don't waste your time with this record and buy his last album ""I Give You My Word"".  Highlights of ""The Rock""- Frisco Stand Up, Planet Fillmoe, So Young, Way More Than They Can See, Pimps & Hustlas"
2,I bought this for my mom and even though she's a big fan she only liked the first 5 songs. The second disk is a complete snooze
2,"I bought Usher's 8701 on tape long ago, and I remember liking it. Then a couple of years ago, I bought it again on cd, listened to it, and wondered why I wasted my money.  Maybe it's the fact that I've grown, but this album sounds so un-soulful now. It is just lacking any spirit, sort of like an over-produced record: all studio magic, but no magic from the singer. Even the songs that are SUPPOSED to sound heartfelt, don't. The album sounds dated, not transcendent of time and era like all the albums that become classics. The songs are very forgettable, and I don't see any of them being seen as classics twenty years from now.  Usher has yet to make a masterpiece.  Addendum: I was a little unfair in my rating. The album deserves 3 stars, not 2. Unfortunately, I can't change it."
1,"This presentation of Mr. Boone's deserves a 1 for effort, a 5 for the best bad thing I've ever heard.  He made of mess of Little Richard's ""Tutti Fruitti"" way back when.  So, in keeping with such destruction, he went after our precious metal hits.  Funny stuff, though.  I keep thinking of the those sad off the strip casino bands trying to entertain folks who just want a $1.99 breakfast and a win at the nickel machines. "
2,"Conventional Karaoke titles use CD-G formats.  This should have been labelled a Disney Sing along Album.  Printed lyrics do not make a Karaoke CD which is entirely misleading the general consumer.  Fortunately the variety of songs and quality of the recordings still give a strong entertainment value for your child.  If you want the variety of Disney music, here it is.  If you want a sing along album, especially if you do not have a Karaoke player, you have your wish.    If you want a Karaoke format, look elsewhere. "
1,"I can not believe this is marketed as a karaoke CD!  This is just a regular music CD with the lyrics inside the package.  The lyrics do NOT show up on the TV screen when put into the karaoke machine.  No fun at all if you have to hold the microphone with one hand the the lyrics in another, under good light because the type is so small!!!!  Oh yeah, great fun for a 6 year old.....NOT!!"
1,"I like most of AC/DC's music, but I can't stand their latest album Stiff Upper Lip.  Stiff Upper Lip is the only AC/DC album where you can play it all the way through, and not even hear one good song.  Stiff Upper Lip doesn't even come close to being as good as Back in Black or Highway to Hell.  Every song on it just bugs the heck out of me.  Listening to one song off this album is enough to test my patience; but enduring all 12 of these musical abominations is enough to drive me crazy!  The overall sound is very similar to their earlier albums like Highway to Hell or Back in Black.  BUT...those CDs had variety, they were semi original, and they were actually pretty good.  THIS CD is just completely worthless.  I have heard some cra ppy CDs in my lifetime, but none of them were more pain to listen to than this.  The vocalist sounds about 10 times worse than he did on their earlier albums, the music is chunky, repetitive, dull, and boring, and most of the songs sound the same. Stiff Upper Lip is so bland and dull sounding that it sounds more like the monotonous droning of an electric fan than a rock n roll band.  The music is so repetitive and similar sounding that its more like listening to the same annoying song for 60 minutes than 12 separate tracks.  This CD is just unbelievaby terrible.  It is a disgrace to this band's legacy, and the band members should be embarrased by it.  Oh well, I guess they probably only made this album because they needed to fulfill their record contract, so I guess they don't care about how awful it is anyway.  All I can tell you potential buyers is to stay as far away from this piece of garbage as possible.  It is a TOTAL piece of cr ap and it is not fit to listen to.  Go buy a GOOD AC/DC CD like Let there Be Rock, High Voltage, Powerage, Highway to Hell, or Back in Black.  Stiff Upper Lip suc ks so hard it leaves a big purple bruise.  It's so awful I'd rather listen to the new Nickelback CD than this!"
2,"They had a swagger at Monterey 67 and were in the right place at the right time.  I like about 3 tracks on this album (their first and best).  I can't recommend it to the masses, I purchased this mainly for historical purposes.  You MUST listen to Jefferson Airplane (first 2 albums only), Peanut Butter Conspiracy (first 2 albums only), Grateful Dead (skip first 2 ablums) before you dig this deep for lost nuggets"
5,"Pat Benatar is a natural. This compilation has been thoroughly reviewed, so I will focus on four very different songs. Her phenomenal voice comes piercing through on ""Heartbreaker,"" a jaunty tune with catchy lyrics & intense energy. In ""I need a lover,"" she deciphers a females self-awareness that is rarely heard from in this genre of music. ""We Live For Love,"" is a smooth sensual song that appeals to the romantic in all of us. This one is good for dancing or driving on a breezy autumn day. ""Hell Is For Children,"" a deeply disturbing tune with its descriptions of child abuse. It brings out any decent persons protectiveness towards kids everywhere. Lastly, in ""Love Is A Battlefield."" She takes the listener on a roller coaster ride of emotions. The honest lyrics & her perfect delivery makes one ponder the title. All of her fans will be pleased with this entire compilation. It has no flaws"
2,"I was very excited to own this album knowing that this was a jazztronica album from one of the ECM masters.

5,"Whatever happened to melody, creativity, individuality and good old  beats?  Somewhere along the line it has been replace by singers who can't sing, write or play an instrument, songs without melodies and beats as monotonous as a flywheel.  Fortunately the Eurythmics are of the former school - turning out original, quality hits that showed a spark of genius at times.  (""Sweet Things"" is perhaps the most famous song of the decade - deservedly so.) The haunting voice, odd instrumentation and artistic approach to every track makes this one a winner.  My grade: "
5,"I'm writing this review to respond to a reviewer's frustrations that the liner notes he received were those belonging to the ""Sweet Dreams"" album.  This happened to me as well when I bought the CD from Borders.  So, I got a refund for it, bought a copy from Barnes and Noble, and the same thing happened.  Finally, I took my money to Best Buy, and found the correct liner notes!  So, the Barnes and Noble/Best Buy shipments must have been faulty.  For those interested in purchasing the album, I found it quite enjoyable.  I'm too young to have had the original LPs, so any bonus tracks released were nice to have.  I found the photos intriguing as well, once I had the correct booklet!  In my opinion though, it was worth the effort to have the correct liner notes"
2,"Jim Messina has played in a some great bands. He played in the Buffalo Springfield, a group of young legends.  He also played in Poco, probably the most under-appreciated and under-rated band of the era.  With these credentials, you can put Messina's name up there with the likes of Stills, Furay, Young, Nash, Crosby, Frey and Browne.  Then he teams up with Kenny Loggins, and things get bad.  I picked up this album, expecting greatness from these two, and I simply didn't find it.  What I found was two decent tunes surrounded by silly and annoying pop.  Most songs on here have simple lyrics, and are over-produced.  I do like two songs on here.  ""Till The Ends Meet"" is a nice, easy tune, and Loggins sounds very nice on this one.  The other song I like is ""Angry Eyes."" The intro is very cool, and the singing interplay between Loggins and Messina is fun and interesting here.  The main point here is that this album does not live up to expectation in the least.  There's no folk, no country rock, no free and easy feeling to this one.  This is blatant pop-music.  If you like bouncy pop, this might be for you.  If you're looking for anything like Poco or Buffalo Springfield, you will experience a huge bummer."
5,"Mr. Farlow came along years before Wes Montgomery, and never achieved Wes's level of mass appeal. Listen to this 1956 album, however, and you will be amazed. This expanded CD has 63 swinging minutes of guitar, piano and bass, but the trio sounds like a quintet at least. The old standards are recognizable, the tunes written without lyrics are interesting, and the absence of horns or drums isn't noticed at all. I wanted this when it was an LP but never got my hands on it. I have coveted it on CD the last few years, looking for a bargain price, but finally settled on something close to full retail. It's worth it. Enjoyable all the way through, I could see how a real guitar lover might declare this to be his favorite jazz disc ever. I expect to hear this one a lot over the next year or two, and to be fully satisfied. Read the other reviews posted here for &quot;why&quot; it works, and &quot;how&quot; Tal was so good. As a non-musician, all I can say is &quot;This one is great fun and what 50's jazz was all about.&quot"
2,"I love Morton Feldman. I have a lot of his music, and I especially like the Second String Quartet. Triadic Memories leaves me indifferent. It may be the performance, I don't know. But the music is boring. And repeat listenings only confirm my experience"
1,"Let me start by putting out a couple of my biases before getting into this review-- first, I relaly don't care for remixes as a rule, unless they're dramatic and severely restructure a song, I generally find they add little. Second, I really don't care for ""The Hand That Feeds"".  Having said that, the piece is presented in three mixes, the album version, the Straight mix, and the Dub mix. The album version has a catchy, circular guitar line and a straightahead drum beat that's actually decent until the bridge with this bizarrely irritating spoken wordish section. Just doesn't work.  The remixes fare no better-- the Straight mix adds different rock beats and an extended introduction that eventually becomes tedious, the dub mix layers a grating sustained guitar note over a beat and a mumbled repeated take on the chorus.  If you're a fan, get it. If not, skip this one, there's good reasons it wasn't released in the U.S"
5,"When you're young, it's quite fashionable to bemoan the lack of authentic individuals. When you grow older, you learn that you were correct. My Cherokee ancestors believe that adulthood begins at 51, and as I get closer to that age, I realize how right they are. Well, here's an individual for you. Slim Gaillard.   I have a four-CD set called LAUGHING IN RHYTHM. 1937 through 1952 from one of the great innovators in jazz. Musically creative, technically skillful, always soulful, lyrically hilarious, and perhaps an example of somebody under age 51 achieving adulthood. I can't stop listening to it. At home, in my MP3 player on the buses of China... Lemme get nuts here. If you ignore every other review I've ever written, note these three words. ""Buy this one."" It's like that, folks. Slim is da bomb."
5,"What can you say - this is a PERFECT song. There is not a flawed moment in it. I, too heard this on the Before Sunset trailer and was mesmerized by its beauty. Makes ME swoon. Love it"
1,Making it no reason to even consider getting this filler filled P.O.S
5,"Dante XXI  What a fantastic album! A huge achievement by a band that continues to produce excellent music despite a huge amount of criticism from fans of Cavalera-era Sepultura.  It's surprising that people can't get over the fact that Max Cavalera left a whole decade ago. Since then Sep have moved on and I doubt they would have made Dante XXI had Max still been at the helm. Frankly, bands should be applauded for pushing the boundaries of themselves and their fans. If you follow a band, it's sometimes worth having a little faith in them, I feel. I guess we fall in love with a band after hearing a couple of albums and that those albums become the band. But the band themselves have a totally different perspective! The music they produce is a product of the dynamics of the members of the band, their abilities, relative strengths, experience, musical preferences etcetera. All of these factors can change over time; indeed SHOULD change over time. Hence, aspects of Sep's music have changed also. How sad would it be to say that Sepultura had learnt nothing new in the last 10 years? That their music had been influenced by nothing that has happened to them? Why would anyone want them to keep copying the sound of their earlier work? Would you really want Sepultura to just regurgitate Arise and Chaos AD tracks? Wouldn't that just put them on a par with bands like Status Quo? How utterly tragic that would be.  When playing live, they play a huge number of older songs because they know we want to hear them too. So, if you want older stuff, don't expect it on a new album - go see them live. They're better live than on a disc any day!  Dante XXI is certainly more consistently thrashy than their other post-Cavalera output. (So, if you've been missing that aspect of Sepultura: here it is!) Green's vocals are awesome; there are terrific riffs and fantastic rhythm. It's hard to pick a favourite, but if pressed, I'd recommend you listen to 'Fighting On' - and turn it up VERY LOUD!  With Dante XXI, Sepultura continue to successfully broaden the musical boundaries of both themselves and their fans.  So, set aside your preconceptions and give this album a good listen - you'll love it. "
2,"I have been a fan of Oregon's since they surprised me at the 1974 Newport in New York jazz festival. They walked onto the Avery Fischer Hall stage in saffron gowns, grabbing their tablas, sitars, and other Indian instruments, and all I could say to myself was, ""Oh, THIS won't be jazz."" Their electrifying performance proved otherwise. It was the best set I heard in the entire festival, and Oregon went on to be a progressive force in jazz for many years afterward. However, I found ""Prime"" to be much like the homogenized music that populates the ""smooth jazz"" airways. Though their performances are still of virtuoso quality, the compositions on this CD struck me as formless, generic and unmemorable. I will always appreciate Oregon's body of work, but I cannot recommend this CD as one that is representative of their prodigious gifts"
1,"I am so happy you sent me this e-mail.  I purchased this CD for my brother for Christmas and you sent me the wrong CD - I received something called WHORACLE by IN FLAMES which is not what I ordered and I am really disappointed and I would really like it if you would send me what I ordered, which is the Jimmy Buffett CD - THE ULTIMATE COLLECTION......... Please get back to me.  Thank you, Rosane Cassell"
5,"Of course I remember back when I first heard this song; I was still in high school (yes, the 80's), and it was not from the BHC movie either (I wasn't allowed to see it in theaters). It was at a local club a few years later. This song has not only a KILLER beat that ANYONE can dance to, but KILLER lyrics, singers, and that it was produced by Prince himself - so naturally this song WAS a winner. Still is. It rocks, baby. And I PROUDLY have several copies on CD, cassette AND mp3. A little obsessed perhaps???? Not really. But this literate one-hit-wonder was an indeed dance-club classic, similar to Eddie Murphy's dance hit class one-hit-wonder ""Party all the Time"".  I love singing along to this hit song. And the singers are sharp, focused, and are actually VERY GOOD VOCALISTS. The music flows very smoothly throughout the song, especially the break, where the girl says, ""I don't like this groove....give me something I can CROON to.....catch my drift???""    PEANU"
1,Not nearly up to the standards of their first CD.  Includes too many sophomoric teenage love songs
1,"there is good tune you can dance over and over again ""LET IT WHIP""  by the dazz band. the rest are  funky wild music not for elective taste"
1,"I purchased the Adaptation soundtrack thinking the song from the trailer and the V.W. commercial would be on it. The soundtrack is nothing more than very horrible sounds, nothing from the trailer and very expensive. False advertising at it's best"
2,"Modest Mouse are reported to be living somewhere inside this album.  I, however, cannot find them.  This is the first music they have released that is completely forgettable.  It comes out of the speakers, into your ears and then disappears.  All of the previous MM releases, and I've heard, loved and lived them all, are unique, enduring and beloved pieces of music; this record is not of that ilk.  And that's a real shame, MM are one of the finest bands of the past 10 or 15 years, right up there with the likes of Ween, Built to Spill and all of the Jagjaguwar bands.  Oh well, a rare miss.  I'm still a huge fan, still gonna go see them whenever the tour rolls around (definately go see them live, when Isaac isn't too drunk, the shows can be legendary), still gonna love the freak rock phenomena that is Modest Mouse, just can't seem to get behind this release.     "
4,"I'm not usually a fan of ""power metal"", but this was a pretty good cd all the same.  Some of the songs sound basically the same but there are few that stand out.  Great guitar riff on song 5 The Edge of Paradise. Overall worth buying!"
1,"I hate this music because it is boring, stupid, and downright weak. Let's go over the songs.  1. ""The Tide Is High 0/10 I hate this song! Blondie is the worst group in music history.  2. ""Dancing Queen"" 0/10 I hate Abba to no end!  3. ""I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself"" 0/10 I hate Dusty Springfield until armageddon comes. I hate this album because it does not have any music of the macabre, sinister, and devilish. So if you want music then look somewhere else, otherwise, stay clear of this mess"
4,Of the songs on the CD Heaven Must Be Missing an Angel was the best.  To dance or roller-skate to it was a blast
5,"wilder than louise armstrong of the hot 5's, more adventurous than miles davis in agartha, more rock than the millions and millions of american garage bands since 1960.  i was there.  this is it"
5,"As the review below states, ""The Tokyo Blues"" is one of Horace Silver's best albums.  But with all due respect to Mr. Jones, let's write reviews that tell the people a little bit more about the CD they are thinking about buying.  Recorded in July 1962, six months after a successful and impressionable tour of Japan, ""The Tokyo Blues"" is Silver's way of saying thank you for the generous hospitality he received while on the other side of the Pacific.  Each of the disc's five tunes has a title that refers to an aspect of Japanese culture or tradition.  But don't think Silver went so far as to incorporate Japanese music on this album, for this is classic hard bop from one of the master's of the genre.  The band here is the famous Quintet of 1959-63 (Blue Mitchell on trumpet, Junior Cook on tenor sax, Gene Taylor on bass) with one exception -- John Harris Jr. replaces Roy Brooks on drums, who was ill at the time of this session.  While ""The Tokyo Blues"" may not quite live up to ""Song For My Father,"" it is as good as anything else this quintet cut, including ""Silver's Serenade,"" ""Finger Poppin"" and ""Blowin' The Blues Away."
5,"how do you know when a production in the music business is awsome? because more than 2 years from its release, people still write and talk about it. Progressive House, House, Deep House. This CD is a MUST HAVE for every person who likes music regardless the type of music.  Global Underground 010 - Danny Tenaglia - Athens does represent what electronic music is all about. If i were to pick up a few CDs for another culture (martians) and let them know what ours is about, this would be one of the ones i would pick"
2,"I am a big Brian Setzer fan going back to the Stray Cats. He quite frankly is one of the few artists out there whose music is just fun, lively, and makes you feel ""Hey man, this is music"". Setzer is as talented on the guitar as Jerry Lee Lewis is on the piano and in my mind no better compliment can be paid to a musician.   Every new iteration of Brian Setzer has been enjoyable: Stray cats, to the Swing of the Dirty Boogie, to the Rockabilly of the Comeback Special, and the superb tribute to sun records.  But, he missed it on this CD. The song writing is silly and sophmoric. I do not expect to find the meaning of life hidden behind the lyrics found in Setzer's CDs but the majority of songs on this CD have all the same elements. Some songs are riddled with rhymes children in the first grade use, and are repeated endlessly. Such as in the song ""Bad Bad Girl in a Bad Bad World"".   For example here is a small snippet out of the song mentioned before:   She's a bad bad girl in a bad bad world A bad bad girl in a bad bad world It's not her fault she's a bad bad world It's so sad it's a sad sad world She's a bad bad girl in a bad bad world A bad bad girl in a bad bad world It's not her fault she's a bad bad world She's a bad bad, bad bad, bad bad, bad bad girl  What garbage! By the end of the little chorus you just want to give the CD a toss.  Many of his songs are riddled with the disjointed tempo changes found in punk music. Setzer has been able to do this subtly in the past without calling attention to it, but there are a few songs on here that just sound confused. Definately not a Setzer trait.   There has never been a Setzer song that I absolutely cannot stand, until ""Really Rockabilly"" and ""Bad Bad Girl"". The first two bad songs he has done on the same disc. There is not one single song on here that compares favorably with any other of his songs that have come before.   I have to mention that I hold Setzer to a very high standard, which until now he has never fallen short of. This CD is still far better than 95% of the crap that is being released in today's market.  To summarize I would encourage Setzer to get beyond this CD, and return to his thrown a top the music landscape"
4,"A potentially and stunned melodic death metal album. I'm not considder their best work but this album is their most complete. Incredible melodies, excellent musicianship, stunning guitar riffs. An awesome record by this guys!!"
5,"For many people they only think of Mary Martin or Mitzi Gaynor in ""South Pacific"" so this should be a new and enjoyable experience. I love getting different performers takes on roles that is why I purchase so many different recordings of the same title. This recording sounds remarkable with all the new technology they use to preserve these recordings. It was really great to listen to this because I have heard so much about this limited production so many years ago. I think Florence Henderson is a natural for Nellie Forbush, I think she is a very underrated stage performer and singer.So many people tend to just think of Ms.Henderson as that famous Mrs.Brady role. One shall be quite surprised. Another surprise on this was Giorgio Tozzi his operetic voice brings such depth and masculinity to his role as Emile, it is a perfect match for Ms.Henderson's in their duets. The rest of this cast sounds fine and it is one of Rodgers and Hammerstein's best scores. I think the best things about this recording is that this availability gives people more avenues to enjoy and explore this classic work"
5,"Boyz II Men's Coolhighharmony is 1 of the best CD's i ever bought. I LUV IT!!! first, i was only getting the cd for the hit, ""End of the road"". when i had just got the cd, i listend to the entire thing and soon i wasnt skipping tracks to go to end of the road, i was listening to the whole thing. Every song on this cd is good. its been almost 9 years and i still favor this cd"
5,"Ive listened to ever possible Sinatra era from Dorsey days to the final Reprise days. His voice never seems to falter like most reviewers claim. It would help if I knew when this cd was recorded, but it really doesnt give any information about the dates of the performances. The whole cd proves why Sinatra is one of the greatest entertainers of all time. Ive heard ever live cd by Sinatra and enjoy all of them. I highly recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys good music. Anyone who gives this album less then a four, need to listen to the cd again. Excellent Sinatra concert!"
1,"Wow.  I didn't know music could get this bad. I just didn't.  No words can describe how awful this CD is, but criticizing it is too easy.  Let me list the reasons why you should not buy this travesty of an album (even the word ""album"" is used loosely - at best, this collection resembles a group of theme songs from various C-Grade Telenovela series):  1. THE VOICE :  There is no voice. Granted, JLO was never known for her vocal ability, but having taken vocal lessons and practice from husband Marc Antony, one would think she would sound better, but NO. If anything, Jennifers' weak voice is showcased as being even more weak as she literally whines her way through over an hour of the most godawful caterwauling ever heard this side of the Nanjing Massacre.  2. THE MUSIC :  There is no music. The first single ""Que Hiciste"" has some Spanish sounding instruments thrown in for that ""authentic Mexican experience"" (yeah, right), but from then on out, its one disgusting ballad after the other. There is no melody, and at one point, I was wishing that SOME poor B-side from her ""On the 6"" album would pop up to put me out of my misery. Let it be clear - the music on this is non-existent, and Im not just saying that for effect.  3. THE ACCENT:  JLO is not a genuine native Spanish speaker, but she has definitely worked on her accent. However, its a bit sad when Beyonce's new Spanish version of ""Irreplaceable"" sounds more authentic than anything on this godforsaken CD. Jennifer sounds very forced and gimmicky here, enunciating her Rs and Ts with gusto and a very misplaced conviction. The efforts only lead to what one can call an overwhelming sense of underwhelmingness (the term has come into existence upon the release of this CD)  Jennifer, what went wrong? You had the best producers (though, when you think of it, Marc Antony's only claim to fame in the US is his horrendous ""You Sang to Me"") and enough moolah to pull this off. Inexcusable.  More than that, it proves that the global Spanish revolution that sort of began in the late 90s with the Ricky Martin craze, is definitely over. Jennifer is done with, and when I start respecting her lesser, more vapid counterparts such as Thalia, its a sad day indeed.  True Spanish language albums have CLASS stamped upon them - the only shining example of this is 'Fijacion Oral Vol 1' by our girl Shakira. This album still gives me goosebumps two years past its' release.  'Coma Ama Una Mujer' is a failed effort for all concerned. And if you respect music and your money, you will definitely need to look elsewhere for fulfilment.  Vaya con dios, JL"
5,I picked this cd up after hearing a single freestyle from a mixtape like 2 years before this dropped and knew I had to have it. Im so pleased w/ this album (and all of supas music) that everytime I listen to it I like it a little more. One of those cds you can just pop in and listen till it's over. I just got deadline in the mail today and it's not even in the same league as this album and still better than most cds Ive listened to this year. You can see how he really strives for greatness and is constantly evolving. A true masterpeice and future classic
4,"What a Girl wants is a soundtrack with some cheesy music and some poppy princess music, which inbalances it. The music in the movie well fits the scenes that they're in, but it's just very ""cheesy"" and ""princess poppy"". Some of the music is very upbeat and some of the music changes your attitude as you listen to that song, giving you a mood the song has. But overall, the soundtrack is pretty worth the listen to.   1. Good Life - Leslie Millis 5/5    2. Out Of Place - Gavin Thorpe  3/5  3. Crazy - Meredith Brooks 3/5   4. London Calling - The Clash  3/5  5. Who Invited You - The Donnas 2/5  6. Long Time Coming - Oliver James 1/5   7. Kiss Kiss - Holly Valance 5/5 8. What's Your Flava? - Craig David 5/5    9.

5,I am 31 - but grew up on country music.  I love all music - but especially older country music.  I love Hank senior Johnny Cash etc.  This CD is one of my very best purchases ever.  I have a large music collection.  If you enjoy his music -this is a must buy.  Don't think twice. The best music is a souls essence released in song
2,"If Axiom of Choice have a great talent, it's for getting their music fairly widely known.  But a lot of the music on this cd sounds like an absent-minded jam anyone could have in their garage with a friend.  There's some richer music on this cd, a song or 2, but not really.  For music like this, I recommend other people such as Vas, Rasa, Stellamara, &amp; even Loreena McKennitt"
2,"Why does this cd not appeal to me? Well, it doesn't have what it takes (in my opinion) to reach inside of me and make me tap my foot to the beat. His previous songs did that. Sure, Will is growing and I hope he continues to grow but this cd was a disappointment to me. I expected more. Should you buy this cd? Sure! If you're a fan of Will then go for it. If you want a totally different style of Will then give it a bash. If you're looking for some upbeat music that will make you bop your head at a party or while driving then I suggest you pick another cd"
1,"The Item you sent me was not the right item. I think?  Then you sent me the same item back to me.? Did ask for knowledge on what the difference was on REISSUE and REMASTER. I could have already purchased this item, REISSUE, at the store down the street for less the amount that I spent at Amazon.  Sorry not a satisfied customer"
4,"This soundtrack comes with the .hack//sign vol.4 limited  edition dvd. The soundtrack has great new versions of tons of songs from the anime. If your colledcting .hack, it is a must have."
5,"From all the other reviews, you can pry tell what they sound like so I will just rate the songsw with my opinion  Bombtrack--5/5---Hard rockin with some damn good rappin mixed in  Killing in the Name--5/5---When you listen closely, you can hear the message, put in an amazing rock hit.  Take the power back--5/5---Funky, enjoyable, rockin, what more do you need. Some great riffs in this  Wake Up--4/5---Don't listen to this song very often because you wont want to hear it too much.  Settle for nothing--1/5---terrible, slow with too much goddamn screaming. The one song by this band that I hate  Know you enemy--5/5---funky rock.rap song that is a lot of fun to listen to  Bullet in your head--4/5---Great bass lines, but a little annoying with too much screaming  Wake up--4/5  Fistful of steel--5/5  Township rebellion--3/5--- a little annoying, but fun for a little while  Freedom--5/5---Great album close"
5,"Now this is very good. A CD set with some of the best post-punk material to come out of Liverpool and Manchester. there is unfortunately some great overlap with the Martin Hannett story CD but this set is overall more satisfying since it is more varied and also contains more stuff as well as a few rarities that everybody will appreciate. Indeed, in additioon to Buzzcocks, the Fall and New Order, which were obvious choices there are also some old favourites like Ludus, Crispy Ambulance and Big in Japan that merit to be heard. If you are interested in thie very special period in british music history then this is an essential acquisition."
4,"Ok, well I have to admit that I am as much a fan of the guitar sounds as I am Adam Duritz's voice. I would have rated this as a five star album, yet every once in a while (on maybe two or the songs total) Adam will get caught up in some moment singing and the dud gets kind of whiny. This guy is one of the best singers on the planet, though and this cd is still one of the best that the Counting Crows have ever produced. Okay, well, the guitar sounds are much more raw, very retro and vintage sounding, I wouldn't be suprised if every guitar, amp, and effects pedal are 30+ years old. My favorite songs are definitely Raining in Baltimore (amazing quiet version), Long December, Have You Seen me Lately?, Recovering the Satelites, and Round Here. If you like retro music with strong raw vocals you should love this stuff. I've heard Adam's voice coompared with Rob Thomas of Matchbox 20. Although I would say that they are very unique I admit that for comparison they are simalar in style (Adam's better though). I hope you like the album. Enjoy"
5,"In 1962, it had been three years since Sonny Rollins had released a record.  Frustrated with what he felt was his own limitations, he took sabbatical to work on his form, practicing at the Williamsburg Bridge.  This odd habit led to his comeback album being named ""The Bridge"".  A quartet record featuring guitarist Jim Hall, bassist Bob Cranshaw, and drummer Ben Riley, invariably this album and it's story is the stuff of legends, and deservedly so.  Rollins is on fire throughout-- playing mostly standards (with only two originals), it sounds as if he was itching to get in the studio again, his playing is powerful, focused (""Without a Song""), lyrical (one of the definitive readings of ""God Bless the Child"") and emotive (""Where Are You?"").  Rollins' support is generous and sympathetic, particularly on ""God Bless the Child"", where Cranshaw in particular feels like he's breathing in time with Rollins.  All in all, a worthwhile effort, and an essential point in Rollins' catalog.  It also may be the best place (either this or ""Saxophone Collosus"") to begin exploring Rollins' catalog.  Highly recommended"
2,"Gotta go with the folks who are DBT fans but think they missed a step on this one. Yeah, ""February 14"" and ""Gravity's Gone"" are good tracks, but other than that it's pretty forgettable. I'm especially bummed by Jason Isbell's tunes - what the heck happened? The tracks he wrote for ""Dirty South"" and ""Decoration Day"" were far and away the best songs on amazing records. Now he sounds like a Doobie Brother or something equally silly.   C'mon guys, get it together! "
5,"After churning out psychedelic sludge with Vanilla Fudge, bassist Tim Bogert and drummer Carmine Appice joined the blues-rock gold rush of the early '70s. Entertaining in a Spinal Tap way, Cactus spew fantastic riffs as strutting metalhead Rusty Day plays badass frontman. ""Rockout, Whatever You Feel Like"" is a best song of the ages.best album in years fantastic best as it gets"
2,"""Teach Me Sweetheart"" and ""Waiting To Know You"" get a lot of play around my parts. Likeable, but heavy on the weirdo synth sounds. Ease off the Pro Tools knobs man"
2,Like other reviewers of this CD I bought it because I liked the song Livin La Vida Loca which is played a lot on radio stations and to be honest it's the only song I like on this CD! The other songs just don't appeal to me. He is a good singer though
4,"This is a good collection but I think the previous albums are better. There are a couple of nice tracks but you can feel something missing in most of them. All in all a worthwhile buy if you are a big fan, like me ;"
4,"Dope CD, I liked it, some phat beats and lyrics, everyone does a good job on this CD. Didnt like I couple of songs, but apart from that I loved this"
2,"I was very excited when I finally received this CD because of all of the great reviews. I listened to the first song- it was good. I listen to the third- it was okay. By the time I reached the very end, I realized all of the songs sounded the same except for one.  The music is mostly composed of the traditional rock guitar with a combination of techno sounds. The melodies have been slightly changed, and some have a slower tempo than the originals. I don't mind any of these things. The problem I had was with their lack of a variety of different instruments and styles. All of the songs are semi-hard rock with techno sounds from late 80's music (I can't stand those cheesy saxophone sounds).   I wish they added a few vocalists to the music, used a combination of styles, and not try to fill every second with a barrage of sounds. I suggest you buy a couple songs, but not waste your money on buying the whole CD"
5,"Still haunting and mysterious just as the first two, this would have to be my most favorite out of the Harry Potter installments. Each track on this soundtrack gives you a clear idea of how the movie is like in your head, having the same theme of the last two movies, but making it more eerie and more amusing to listen to it. Having loud tracks, some tracks are beautiful; such as Track 6 and Track 15. I'm very happy that most of the tracks are over 2 minutes long, not having to change the track in like a minute and able to enjoy the melodic score. John Williams is an excellent composer. I highly recommend this to anyone!   1. Lumos! (Hedwig's Theme)  5/5 2. Aunt Marge's Waltz  4/5   3. The Knight Bus   4/5  4. Apparition on the Train  5/5 5. Double Trouble  5/5 6. Buckbeak's Flight  5/5   7. A Window to the Past  5/5  8. The Whomping Willow and the Snowball Fight 5/5  9. Secrets of the Castle  4/5 10. The Portrait Gallery  5/5    11. Hagrid the Professor   5/5  (Sounds Renaissance) 12. Monster Books and Boggarts!  3/5  13. Quidditch, Third Year  4/5 14. Lupin's Transformation and Chasing Scabbers  4/5  15. The Patronus Light  5/5   16. The Werewolf Scene 5/5  (Exciting)  17. Saving Buckbeak  4/5   18. Forward to Time Past  5/5   19. The Dementors Converge  4/5   20. Finale  5/5  21. Mischief Managed!  5/5  Hope you enjoy!   Jordan Overall grade* "
5,"The greatest thing about this LP is the songwriting.  Sexsmith writes songs about overcoming a difficult upbringing, dealing with mortality and being average.  I think he tends to write too many love songs on his other albums but on Other Songs he creates a great diversity and depth.  Mitchell Froom's production is perfect for the songwriting (it's almost as good as Kiko)"
4,"By the way, the 'Tumblin' Tumbleweed' version is by 'Roy Rogers & Sons of the Pioneers', not 'Riders In The Sky"
2,"I don't know what happened with this effort.  I have yet to stop listening to Hellbilly Deluxe and Sinister Urge.  However,I have listened to Educated Horses (through) once, maybe twice. I just cannot make myself listen to it.  And that is really sad because I love Rob Zombie and his music"
1,"Don't believe any positive review of this CD - there is not ONE track that is remotely tolerable music.  This is prime, grade AAA, amateur musical trash ...  if considering this CD, do yourself a favor and just flush the money down the toilet so you can skip the agrevation and the shipping costs. In the past I have given ""CD reviews"" a lot of credence ... NO MORE!!!!  This is foolishness"
1,Ruben Did Not Do This Song Justice. If You Are Going To Cover A Song You Better Do A Better Job Then The Origal. If You What To Hear Flying Without Wings Song Like It Should Be Check Out Westlife
1,"Lets get 1 fact out: IRON MAIDEN DOESNT CARE ANYMORE!!!  How can they be SO brilliant with # of the beast, Piece of Mind & PowerSlave & then put out 5 terrible records in a row starting with X-factor?  This record is soooo boring! I bought it based on Wickerman which I found to be OK, reminiscent of  the old Iron Maiden & then they just ran completely out of material. Track 2 on sounds exactly the same, long boring slow tunes that never end.. going track after track, album after album. Does ""Dream of Mirrors"" ever end? I cant ever tell.. I just lose my attention due to its such a GD drag. Then they hit me with ""Thin Line"" which is even less interesting than the most boring professor I had in the most boring class in my entire college career.   You cant listen to the original ""Iron Maiden"" release & then seriously listen to this new crap & release it, unless you just dont care. Obviously they dont CARE!! This record is TERRIBLE!  If they did care they would relisten to the first 6 or so & rethink thier efforts & either improve the sound or just end Iron Maiden & come out with a new band named ""Too old, too tired!"" & quit defiling the great name of ""IRON MAIDEN"""
1,"unlike other more chill travis discs like ""the man who"" and ""invisible band,"" this cd is really pretty heavy.  I gave the cd away to a buddy of mine who likes hard rock and he loves it.  This is not a cd to put on and relax to"
5,"I'm also 33 years old but my parents actually had the LP of this great album.  (What's a CD?)  However it's been collecting dust for 25 years since it's too worn out to listen to.  Plus, where is that darned old record player anyway!  After recently acquiring this LP on CD, trust me, you'll be glad to hear this fine &quot;tribute to the best&quot; in true 21st century hi-fi sound (CD quality).  Oh yeah, the songs are all good to, but I've loved this album since the '70s. Ahh Haa"
5,"This is by far Modest Mouse's best album. It is hard for most people to understand at first. This album has a whole different feel to it than the rest of their albums. This was the first Modest Mouse album I ever heard, and I couldn't get into it and didn't want to at first. But a friend convinced me to sit through it 3 or 4 times, and now I can't get enough of it. Do yourself a huge favor and buy this album. Close your eyes and listen to it all the way through one or twice, and if you still don't like it, you have poor taste in music and you suck. If you love this album like I do, you'll also love the Ugly Casanova album titled Sharpen Your Teeth. Another great Modest Mouse album is The Fruit That Ate Itself"
1,"basically... kenny wayne is one of the worst excuses for a blues guitarist ive ever seen. i mean sure hes got a little speed but he's pathetic in comparison to pretty much any other guitarist out there! seriously he can't even solo over chord changes! i've heard him compared to the likes over SRV. whoever thinks that is plain deaf. if you want some real hard hittin blues guitar.. go listen to stevie ray, freddie king, albert collins or johnny winter. i feel bad for any music fan who wastes their money on this cd"
2,"I love the other disturbed albums-this one though is somthing of a letdown. with the exeption of ""liberate"" its the same tune from begining to end.   Not great.   I love ten thousand fists though that whole album is teriffic"
2,"I am not sure why this compilation garnered such high scores so far. Maybe because I am into a different brand of dnb, but the tracks on this CD are among the least musical pieces of noise I have heard, with rare exceptions. The beats are rather cliche dnb, which in itself is not too bad. The deep sub-basslines sound great production-wise, but the patterns are often nonsensical.  Generally, if you like very repetitive hard and fast dnb with powerful bass and sinister yet musically simplistic soundscapes, then by all means, get this cd. However, if you expect something fresh, clever, or something that has at least a little bit of musical value, look elsewhere. This is not Roni Size, Aphrodite, or Pendulum. This is dumbed-down Dieselboy"
4,I absolutely love this album!!!  1.) Strong Anything 4/5  2.) No End In Sight 5/5  3.) The Breakup Song 4/5  4.) I Want A Cowboy 5/5  5.) Unbreakable 5/5  6.) Flowers By The Side Of The Road 2/5 ( I don't like songs like this.) 7.) Drop Dead Gorgeous 5/5  8.) Normal 4/5  9.) I Won't Say Goodbye 5/5( My Favorite song on the album)  10.) Home Running Away 4/5  11.) Prelude To The Kiss 4/5  
5,"I loved this Cd by Enrique Iglesias.  I was never a big fan of his until I heard this CD.  The music was so beautiful.  I didn't really know what the songs were about because I do not know much Spanish, but the songs moved me.  Some of them were so beautiful I wanted to cry.  This Cd is well worth the money of buying"
2,"This CD Was uttely boring it sounded like Dianne didn't even care that she was singing. It was a disappointment to me becuase she usually is pretty excting. I felt like she didn't do enough to make this CD perfect. I mean if it was just a regualar person putting out their very first CD, it wouldn't sound like this, becuase it wouldn't sell! Okay so, I have to give it 2 stars becuase at times it sounds relazing and nice, but then I think that every Christmas CD should be as excting as Christmas really is"
5,"What a warm gift.  Thanks Faith!!  This CD was well coordinated and crafted.  The kind of CD you bake cookies, cut greens, make pies, kiss and hug family, kids, while playing. "
1,"I know that this CD set is great, that is why I ordered it. I however got an e-mail after I had already ordered the item that I found on the website saying they refunded my money because the price was wrong and the ""quality of the item wasn't good."" What sort of bad advertising is that? It isn't my fault that they priced it wrong, and if there was a mistake I should have received it anyway. It isn't fair, and I want everyone to know that they obviously did not do their jobs in making sure all of the information was correct to be displayed on the website."
2,"What drugs do I need to take to make this sound good? So many raved about this group so I bought a cd. Big mistake, HUGE. I'm such a sucker"
5,"If someone were to rush up to me and hold a gun to my hand and insist that I recommend one and only one Jesus & Mary Chain album to someone completely unfamiliar with their music with the proviso that it be THE album that would bring that person the most enjoyment, I would be in a complete quandary (though why some insane person would be wielding a pistol in such a nutty undertaking I won't speculate about).  On the one hand, PSYCHOCANDY is unquestionably their masterpiece, not merely a great album, but one of the great precursors of the emergence of alternative music in the nineties.  Yeah, alternative went pop when Nirvana hit it big with NEVERMIND in 1991, but the Jesus & Mary Chain had already copped all the right attitudes and struck all the right chords with PSYCHOCANDY in 1985.  With that album they go down with the Velvet Underground, Television, and Big Star as bands that wield an influence vastly in excess of their collective record sales.    But as great as PSYCHOCANDY is, I'm not sure that 21 SINGLES:  1984-1998 doesn't have better songs.  The collection of singles pulls together not merely the very best songs off PSYCHOCANDY, but a host of great songs off other albums that either weren't as good or weren't very good at all, but nonetheless had a couple of great individual cuts.  For instance, back when I was collecting Jesus & Mary Chain discs, I stopped with PSYCHOCANDY, DARKLANDS, and BARBED WIRE KISSES, two albums and an anthology.  This means that I missed out on some really great cuts that are collected here.  For instance, I was completely blown away by ""Head On"" the first second I heard it, but because I didn't get AUTOMATIC, it was completely new to me.  Same thing is true of ""Blues from a Gun,"" the very scary ""Reverence,"" ""Sometimes Always"" (with guest lead vocal by Hope Sandoval of Mazzy Star), and the wonderful pair of cuts from MUNKI, ""I Love Rock N Roll"" and ""I Hate Rock N Roll.""  These are just great songs, and they really make me regret that I stopped my collecting of their music when I did.    So, I truly hope gun-toting maniacs stay away from me, but if saner, more everyday folk want who are unacquainted with one of the great bands of the eighties and nineties want to dive into their music, I would strongly recommend both PSYCHOCANDY and 21 SINGLES: 1984-1998.  This music is as crucial as anything that arose during the period"
4,"Yea, it's all about the sellout but who cares.  The first song on this album spews acidy alien blood and tears @ss from there.   Paul Leary is quite underrated and Gibby Haynes finally decided to quit being weird without a cause. But they still have a lot of weirdness and that's where some of the filler comes in, but then I never even skip past the German guy.  Bloodlust said everything I needed to say but I'll just back it up- this album is blistering space rock, like Kyuss with the muffler blown off and sped up during the best parts and slowed down at times but all the while complemented by jibberish vocals.   Dust Devil is one of my top 5 favorite songs ever written.  ""Got the power of an upright in his g****m hand! Bahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.  Bahaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"
5,"i haven't finished listening to this cd, it's playing as i type now. much that i've heard lacking in a lot of recordings from the late 70s when mr rollins seemed to be exploring a more popular sound for younger audiences has been recaptured and reshaped, that tone and timbre, his big, full sound, the wonderful improvisation, the sly americana references, the calypso blends, it's all here.  and my best regards to the group, bob cranshaw on bass, steve jordan on drums, bobby broom-guitar, kimati dinizulu-percussionist, and to clifton anderson on trombone, who really knows what it's all about"
4,"Wow! Can you handle derangement recorded on tape? The riffs are tremendous, and the mix is insidious and evil. And then there's Mr. Yow. He's just on another planet"
1,"i have awaited the release of this particular Art of Noise LP onto cd for 20 years. this title was my all-time favorite Art of Noise record. upon opening up the cd & quickly jumping to track 2 - ""Beat Box"" only to find out it has been replaced by the version that appeared on ""Who's Afraid of The Art of Noise"". you can imagine my disappointment! i thought for sure after 20 years i would finally have the original break dance classic of ""Beat Box"" in the digital format. Anyway, being a true Art of Noise fan for many years, this was definately a let down"
2,"To compare this with the Smiths the Furs and the Cure..? is a sacrilege. It is far from those bands, not remotely in their league, and not even close to their sound..  Its lite bouncy uninspired pop. Which is fine, but please be honest with musical comparisons, perhaps listen to the refered bands before using them as a reference"
2,"I was dissapointed when I listened to this cd.  All I wanted was the original version of the Perfect Drug.  This cd only has the remixes.  So if you're buying this cd for the original version, you should just as well buy the soundtrack for the Lost Highway instead"
4,"Loved the movie, really like the CD. It's good music that makes you remember the movie. Perfect addition to a holiday music collection"
5,"You will not be disappointed by this delightful album!  This may be  sacrilege, but the Chieftains can get old after a while (well, they ARE  old)...and Altan is certainly a breath of fresh air.  These folks know what  they're doing, and you can hear it in their whimsical reels.  I look  forward to getting more of their stuff.  Highly recommended"
4,"Very solid release that lacks the radio friendly songs that made Cracker Soul &amp; Kerosene Hat college favorites.  Overall i found the guitar work to be great, same good lyrics and much better vocals from Lowery.  A more creative effort than Gentleman's Blues with less screaming.  I don't know if i agree that this disc has shades of Camper Van Beethoven but this release does remind me more of their first effort Cracker Soul"
5,"It is almost impossible for any album on Amazon to receive nearly a hundred reviews and still get an overall 5 star rating, yet DIFFERENT CLASS has managed to do just that.  Although Pulp has several really good albums, this is their best in my opinion.  It isn't just that the songs are musically compelling; lyrically the songs are frequently and unexpectedly complex.  When this album was first released in England it was one of the rare times when an album achieved simultaneously intense critical and popular acclamation.  Critics declared it a masterpiece, and fans bought it in astonishing numbers.  The album also is deceptively political, in that it features class difference in a large number of songs.    There are many musical highlights on the album, but what I find most remarkable is that there are several songs so good it makes the other songs seem bad in comparison, while one song in particular makes even the other great songs suffer in contrast.  Fans will always differ on their favorites, but few will question that the album starts off strongly with ""Mis-Shapes.""  ""I Spy"" is one of my favorites on the album along with ""Disco 2000,"" which follows it.  ""Sorted for E's and Wizz"" is another stunner.  But seriously, all the songs on the disc are at least good, most are very good, and two or three are great.  But the best of the bunch is unquestionably ""Common People.""  ""Common People"" is simply a great song on multiple levels.  Musically it is incredibly compelling, one of those tunes that once you hear it you can't get it out of your head, with an upbeat tempo that makes you want to get up and dance around.  But this would merely make it a good song; what makes it great is the story the song tells.  An art school student is noticed by a fellow student, a rich girl from Greece, who declares to him that she wants to learn about what it is like to live as one of the common people.  There is a definite sexual come on, as she says that she wants ""to sleep with common people, like you.""  At this point you think you know where the song is going, to a nice if somewhat standard narrative of two people from different classes who have a romance despite it all.  But the song instantly takes you in a different tangent.  What follows is as extraordinary as it is unexpected.  Our hero takes the girl to a supermarket and asks her to imagine being there with no money, a notion she laughs at.  At this point the song turns very serious and dark, as he tears into her for her calloused desire to slum and make a game out of taking on a mode of life that is for others a fairly desperate affair.  He tells her that if she is laying in a bed watching roaches on the wall she can just call her dad and her problems would be over, but to truly find out what it would be like to live like ""common people"" would mean learning what it means to have no choices, no outs, no control.  He sings:  You will never understand How it feels to live your life With no meaning or control  So instead of the song of romance and love that we think we are getting at the beginning, we get an impassioned condemnation of anyone who would make light of the struggles of those who are less well off.  I know of no other song like it.  Pulp has done a number of really fine albums and a host of great songs, but this song has to go down as one of my all time favorites.  It definitely goes onto my all time Top 40.  There are four Pulp albums that I think any serious music fan should own:  HIS 'N' HERS, DIFFERENT CLASS, THIS IS HARDCORE, and WE LOVE LIFE.  If one were bound and determined to own only one Pulp album, one might go with HITS, but this DIFFERENT CLASS is so good that I just can't imagine anyone not wanting this and others as well.  Trust me:  if you don't own this album you need to get it today.  Your ears will thank you"
5,"Say what you want about Bruce ""getting old"", but I strongly believe that this album (which showcases Bruce in his late-40s/early-50s) puts many rockers half-his-age to shame.  All the songs are great, especially the ones that are re-arranged, such as ""The River.""  For a special treat, Bruce throws in the rarity, ""Don't Look Back.""    And yet, of all the songs on this live album, I believe the most impressive is Bruce's acoustic version of ""Born in the U.S.A."", where Bruce plays an acoustic 12-string.  For those of you who have Tracks, but not this, trust me when I say LINYC's version of ""BITUSA"" makes Tracks' acoustic version look like nothing.  ONE WARNING: Though I personally have no qualms about the song-selections, some of you who want to hear the ""staples"" (i.e. ""The Promised Land"") might be dissapointed.  And yet, when it comes to preferences of Bruce-fans, the term ""to each his own"" is definetely applicable.  Is it an extensive treasure-trove of live performances a la Live 1975-1985?  No.  Is it worth it nonetheless?  Yes"
5,I'm listening to NOW 19 right now!!!!!! I love the fact that NOW puts the latest cool songs onto one  GREAT CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! For Christmas I'm getting Now 20!!!!!!
2,"I just recently heard ""Buffalo Stance"" on my local college radio station, and it brought back memories of the first time I heard it in back in the winter of 1989. It isn't difficult to see why this song was so popular back then; it had all the infectious grooves an excellent pop song should have. But there's a problem with the overall album of Raw Like Sushi: all the songs that surround ""Buffalo Stance"" don't even come close to matching its catchiness. Even the inexplicably praised ""Manchild"" is dull.   Find the single for ""Buffalo Stance"" if you can, and pick up a Salt & Pepper album as an alternative to Raw Like Sushi.  "
2,"Although you get alot of songs for $25, you get a lot of garbage which has been typical from MoS in the past two years.  The best songs are from the album that features hits from the past.  You can't really go wrong there.  You'd be better downloading the 10 good songs from iTunes and saving $15"
1,"I didn't buy the CD...I couldn't make it past the samples. I loved Constantine on Idol. I didn't think he was the best there, but I thought he was near the top. Performance wise though, this guy can perform on stage...I just love him. This music though, not impressed. I understand why he would want to promote his original band, but he really needs to give it up and go out on his own. He did so good on Idol and had so many fans. Granted, I'm sure some will buy this CD just because they are a fan. And I'm sure that there are some that will love it. I'm not one of them though. I really wanted to like it, but I just can't. That said though, I would really like to see the Constantine from Idol make his own CD. Now that one I would buy"
1,"CONSTANTINE MAROULIS may be easy on the eyes, but thei s cd is awful.  A bit to hardcore for a debut albumn.  Maybe payback for not getting further in AI, I really think he can sing and does have talent, when he did David Cassidy's I THINK I LOVE YOU, it was a good take on a old 70's song. Then when he did Queens Bohmeian Rhaposdy it sent shivers down my bones, (no Freddy) but not bad. Sorry this is just a disappointment, better luck next cd.  This may have been a let down  to his fans, not to mention that AI  has a large pre teen audience not to mention how many parents would go out and buy this cd, for it surely would have a explicit warning label on it"
2,"2 1/2  Competent though disappointing, this highly referenced trance album cannot escape it's plodding, dated backbone of a beat, no matter how refined and professional the production tries to be. Of course, listening to the album 13 years later, one immediately feels the bland, aged thump soaked into the generic sequencing and tonality, which is not to say the album was not worthy of the praise it garnered upon release-in House-centric circles that is. The thudding, ever present, 4/4 layering of a pulse that guides entirely too much mainstream electronic music out there will vastly undermine any of the dreamy atmosphere heavily present on this ambitious little club-hopper, rendering most of the Yanni-with-edge keyboard melodies banal. Thankfully once in a while, particularly at the start and finish of the disc, a semi-potent spell is afforded these static conditions, allowing Dreamland to shine in refreshingly unrestricted ways"
2,"I own four other albums and all of them are great.  When I pop in a Hootie CD I expect to be relaxed by the soothing voice and the familiar sound that accompany one of my all time favorite bands.  I buy CD's and keep those CD's on the premise that the entire CD is worth keeping.  I am not buying a CD for one or two songs, but the CD as a whole. I just bought this album the other day.  Half of the songs had the familiar feel but the rest could go to waste.  I am giving it a 2.5, because half the album is great. "
1,"Don't buy songs from this racist bastard!!!! And if he so-call ""hates everyone"", why does most of his titles of his b-side songs start with the ""N"" word? Damn hick"
5,"Waterfalls are some of the most primitive things in nature. With this cd, you can't help but think you're right there next to the waterfall. Close your eyes or lie down, and let the natural sounds permeate your mind"
4,Great CD for decorating the house.  It was good to hear some of my favorites singing the holiday songs.  It's very nostalgic
5,"...while we keep hearing the same all tracks every other DJ/Producer is mixing, Sasha comes with a totally different sound that keeps evolving. Can't wait for his next one, awesome."
1,"This item is billed as ""The Best Of "" Shatner and Nimoy..Now I really do have to wonder about the use of the word""Best""here...Neither Shatner nor Spock can sing,so this album exists as a goof...But there really isn't anything funny about the material contained on this disc...indeed,since at the time it was recorded both performers took themselves and thier efforts very seriously,the sides on this album were never intended as joke material..The fact that they HAVE become joke material still does not excuse the fact than any of these sides,by either of these two actors,were ever recorded...Now I like a good joke when I hear one,as well as the next guy,and I appreciate comic tunes,but the dull,tedious,often over-wrought balderdash that is to be found on this album stupefies rather than entertains... Getting back to the use of the word""Best"" as a descrition of what is contained on this album...If this stuff is the""best"" that either man is capable of I can only shudder at the thought of what the stuff left off this compilation must sound like...""Best""...as in The""best""manure the cow has to offer?..As in It's ""Best"" to shoot oneself in the head rather than endure these tunes?Or maybe ""best"" as in IT WOULD BE ""BEST""TO AVOID WASTING YOUR HARD-EARNED MONEY ON THIS FLAPDOODLE....That is a use of the word ""best""that is appropriate...."
2,"That's right, I said it.  I love this album, and yet I still give it two stars.  Let me explain why.    I am rating this album as I would rate any legitimate album.  I do this because I understand that Shatner was being completely serious about this album, and the dramatic interpretations of the two songs/poems/monologues fused together are supposed to symbolize the duality of man, and blah, blah, blah.  I get all of that.  But still, the album is horrendous.  As you listen to it, you cannot help but firmly believe that Shatner thinks he's pulling off some great artistic feat with this album. However, he is wrong.  Horribly wrong.  The arrangement of each ""song"" is sub-par, the backing band of studio musicians on the album has no life, and then there's Shatner himself.  With his trademark delivery, Shatner leaves his indelible mark all over every track, and that's really not such a good thing.  This album would be utterly forgettable, if not for the fact that it is such a train wreck that it is an absolute must-have.  Let me write that again in bold for the folks that may have skipped over this review:  THIS ALBUM WOULD BE UTTERLY FORGETTABLE, IF NOT FOR THE FACT THAT IT IS SUCH A TRAIN WRECK THAT IT IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST-HAVE.   I actually bought this CD as a British import twelve years ago for twenty bucks, long before it was in print on CD in the States, and even now, when I could have bought it for half the price, it is still worth every penny I paid for it all those years ago.  You see, whenever I'm feeling blue, I pop The Shatner into my CD player, and everything gets a little bit better.  It never fails to bring a smile to my face, especially Mr. Tambourine Man and A Very Good Year.    Honestly, this CD is glorious in it's sheer awfulness.  It is so good on such a low level that it has forced me to create a new word to fully describe it: Shatnerrific.  You cannot go wrong buying this CD.  Trust me on this one.  It's my favorite music purchase ever.  No, seriously.  *Ever*.."
1,I would rather buy a plane ticket from him----
2,"I really enjoyed Bear Family's Robert Mitchum two-fer &quot;That Man&quot; and immediately bought this disc when I saw it. First of all, the content is lighter weight than his other albums. These tracks from his early filmwork are great for the Mitchum fan but someone wanting to actually investigate the man's singing ability should be directed to &quot;That Man&quot; or &quot;Calypso Is Like So&quot;. My complaint (and the reason I didn't give it a higher rating) is the packaging. I thought it was beautiful when I first opened it. A shiny gatefold cardboard package with a clear disc tray and a gorgeous book full of movie posters and a complete filmography with lots of great info. Then the tray fell off of the cardboard backing. Then, the pages started falling out of the book! The whole thing literally fell apart on me! For a pricey import disc such as this, it's totally unacceptable. Maybe I just got a defective one, but I'm not willing to plunk down another 22 bucks to find out. If you feel you must buy this disc, a word of caution: handle with care"
1,"I have always been a huge fan of Kris Parker.  I like what KRS has done.  I like what he is doing.  I like the fact that he has never looked to what the masses are putting out and has instead tried from day one to promote positivity.  Therefore, I find that this effort is laudable in its attempt to bring KRS's spirituality to an audience that has been listening to him for decades.  Unfortunately, it falls flat on its face.  The songs on this album do not manage to live up to the message in the lyrics.  KRS is best known for bringing a message to all people by writing about things that could be understood by all people.  That aspect of his work is forgotten on this album, and his work comes across as his preaching instead of his teaching.  It's almost like he's forgotten the experiences that brought about his spirituality, and instead focuses on the goal without paying attention to the trials and tribulations that got him there.  Musically, the beats are mostly just plain terrible, and feel devoid of warmth or personality.  The lyrics feel forced and while his delivery is excellent, the writing is not up to his usual high standard.  Most rappers these days are known for the beats they put together, or the hooks of their songs.  Few are known for true lyrical ability.  KRS has never before fallen victim to this trap.  The reason Criminal Minded, Boom Bap and Necessary did so well was the mix of good writing, excellent delivery and beats that worked with the material presented.  Everyone who listens to hip hop can quote lyrics from those albums (and many, if not most, of KRS's other offerings) - the same can't be said with this album, as he didn't find the right mix to present the material.  Pick up this album if you want a complete KRS ONE collection - otherwise, leave it on the shelf"
2,"Now, I realize after taking a closer listen to this album that this album is not a gospel rap album. On ''Know thy self'', Krs claims that there are many ways to god which is downright not true. Krs claims that any ''God'' that's worshipped will lead you to heaven. Think about that, Allah, Buddah, Jesus, Aphrodite all have nothing to do with each other! Only Jesus deserves to be worshipped! Jesus is the son of god, He did die, And he's the only one that rose again so we could all have a chance to enter heaven regardless of our sin [Which every man and woman has]. As for the cd, I won't lie, It sounds really good and even features a few gospel rappers [T-Bone, B.B. Jay], and Krs even makes significant quotes of actual bible verses, But when it comes down to it, Krs still fails to acknowledge that Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life. This cd gets 2 stars from me for the fact that at least Krs is done dissing Jesus [Something he did on every album after ''Criminal Minded'' and every album before ''The Sneak Attack''] and at least he still ain't afraid to expose the problems of this world, But Krs, If you're reading this, I think you're an extremely talented rapper and you truly need to accept Jesus into your heart. Hope the review helped. Be blessed."
1,"yo for any body that buys,listens or even believes a drop of what he says on this album you are is guilty as he is. Go to [...]and see the real truth. By the way that is not my web site for those that think im trying to get a financial plug and i make no funds or get any love offerings for ditributing this info. May God through ""the real key"" Jesus Christ forgive you and bless you for being so blind"
1,You have Ike Turner and the King of Rhythm as artists for Buddha Bar VIII? If I were to buy this CD? would this be accurate artists?  I would suggest Amazon check their data base
5,"There are a few tracks that stand out on this album.  Pistolero is fantastic with its spicy Latin sound, and Masters of the Universe is good in the typical way.  The deep throaty vocal samples in the track entitled Badimo are very interesting, and carry a unique vibration.  I wonder what it means...   If you like Juno Reactor, this album is worth a look at least"
5,"This is a complete concept album centred around anime and punk classics...  The CD has 13 tracks and clocks in at about 30 minutes this shocked me at first when I put the CD into my pc yet then I realised throughout every minute of the CD it manages to sound fresh no matter how many times you manage to listien to it, this is where the CD'S charm lies in it's bubble gum pop punk rock. It's fun, it's lighthearted it's not serious yet it loves every minute of it ^_^ If you like anime of manga then the packaging will catch you eye immediatly, which is also nice they included the DVD with it so you can see the videos which show off the band's true vision.  If you want some light hearted bubble gum pop punk, or something completly differnt, then you found it. Who thought you could cover the sailor moon theme, sing about captian crunch and cover a punk classic on one album?"
2,"This live album is well recorded, and the band is the best its ever been. Why only 2 stars? The tracklist! Apart from Can I Play With Madnes (yay!) and Lord of the Flies (yawn), its exactly the same as Rock in Rio, released a couple of years ago, with Dance of Death  instead of Brave New World songs.  Why not play Somewhere In Time, or Wasted Years? Or Futureal (ok Blaze song but still)? or Powerslave? All would have fitted into the theme of the concert well. I don't need to see another version of Hallowed Be Thy Name. Or Wrathchild. Or Fear of the Dark. Or Run to the Hills. Good performance (as expected), but VERY disappointing tracklist"
5,"Absolutely a positive influence for our young people!!! I cherish her music, what a wonderful young woman with an amazing voice...whatever she sings!!!  The next best voice of perfection"
5,Now I do not pretend to know everything there is to know about Tears for Fears...but....I LOVE THIS CD! From START TO FINISH! IT is truely a conceptual masterpiece!  I was fortunate enough to see this performed LIVE in Detroit at St. Andrews Music Hall....incredible band incredible musicians...but ROLAND wrote it all!  He is truely a master...and minus CURT too he is still as good as ever! ITS A DARN SHAME that this did not get airplay and the concert only showed up as a small tiny ad in the corner of the local jam rag...but THE SHOW WAS INCREDIBLE the ALBUM has given to many a spin in my car CD player...it was in rotation there for about an entire year and often times repeated!  References to LENNON and MCCARTNEY are made and i think they are RIGHT ON CUE!  Roland is a true pop genius!  WHO CAN REALLY ROCK OUT TOO! Who ever said POP SONGS had to be boring eh? Just see this band perform one time if you are lucky enough!  Somewhere i see he appologized to Radiohead for playing the song CREEP but i saw him perform it with complete perfection!  The stage was extended with speakers galore and sound equipment to fill a HUGE VENUE in a small tiny club!  The lights and music and show were incredible and this cd is a GREAT one to own! CONCEPTUAL and PERFECTION in a POP RECORD!  GIVE THIS BAND MORE CREDIT!  THE poor website for this album set desolate for more than several years no activity!   Shame ITS A LOW DOWN DIRTY CRYING SHAME .....music has no support for the fine artists such as Tears For Fears...however ROLAND and CURT you have my FOREVER SUPPORT You are BOTH TRUE GENIUS's
5,"Where should I start, Well it was 1997 when my older cousin said let me show you a game. It was of course FFVII, I was BLOWN AWAY by the game. At the time I was 7 years old. I immediatly bought the game and played it straight through.   I always loved the music, it was one of the many fine elements of the game. Nobuo Uematsu did an amazing job with the music he is truly an amazing person, If I saw him walking down the street I would bow before him and kiss his shoes (I bet I'm not the only one who would do that).  Here I am now 15 years old just listened through all 4 (YES FOUR!!!) CD's (which I put on my iPOD. I was blown away, with each song I remember exactly what took place in the game and where I was and what I was doing.   Any fan of FF would love this but even people who never played the series would appreciate it, but if you have played the game straight through you can get the full effect of it.  The price you say may be high but lets do a little math here. All four CD's cost $29.18 now there are 85 songs. Divide and each song will cost about 34 cents, yes 34 cents. You buy songs on iTUNES for 99 cents. It's a great deal, I would pay $100 for this.  If you played FFVII BUY IT!!!!!!!!!If you havn't played FFVII buy the game, it's the best game ever screw Halo 2"
5,"Forget about the pop music of Loggins and Messina. This album is different. This happens to be the best Jazz/Country fusion album ever done. There's great musicianship here. There's EXCELLENT instrumental solos that can take up half of the track as in ""Move On"". This is superb music that never made it to the radio. These tracks are simply too long to have gotten air play back in the 1970s. L&M put together a truly great album with Mother Lode but not too many people have heard it. Sadly, they broke up shortly after this album was released. Afterwards, Kenny made a come-back by going strictly pop."
5,"I have always been quite a hard core Indie fan. I cam across my first Otis Redding song 'Try a Little Tenderness' when I was watching the 80s Teen Flick, Pretty In Pink. It struck me as being one of the most emotional, moving and captivating song I had heard in a long time. It caught my emotions exactly at that moment and now remains a song that is very precious to me. I would like to say thank you to Otis Redding for opening my eyes to different varieties of amazing music, and for creating this incredible album. As someone said before, it is a shame we lost him at such a young age as he had such a unique talent, but i am thankful his music remains to keep his memory forever"
5,"I have been an Offspring fan for many years.  I have listened to every one of their albums serveral times over and this one has came out on top of all of the rest.  In my opinion, the albums from greatest to least are (not counting their greatest hits album):  1. Ignition 2. Self Titled 3. Smash 4. Ixnay on The Hombre 5. Americana 6. Splinter 7. Conspiracy of One  Note that I am judging the album as a whole, and not just by the best songs.  Ignition has not a single ""space filler"" song.  It is a raw, 90's punk rock, consistant album.  Some disagree that this is the best of the bunch and argue that Smash is.  I agree Smash has amazing songs like ""Self-Esteem"", ""Come Out and Play"", ""Gone Away"", and many others that helped boost the Offspring to the mainstream.  But not every song on Smash is absolutely good.  ""Dirty Magic"" is the best song on the CD, if not the best Offspring song of all time.  I think it is overlooked and underrated.  Ignition starts off with Dexter yelling ""F**k"" and shows you were the album goes from then on.  ""Session"" is the first song on the CD and one of the top songs of the CD.  There are many great and catchy songs from then on.  Then hits the more emotional, dark, and mysterious song ""Dirty Magic"".  Then it moves into the drug song on the album which is ""Hypodermic"".  After that comes the pyromaniac loving song, ""Burn it Up"".  ""No Hero"" is also a great example of how the Offsping can turn a simple chug riff into something amazing.  ""L.A.P.D."" is to Offsping like ""F**k The Police"" is to N.W.A.  Another catchy song comes after that called ""Nothing From Something"".  And what better way to end the CD with a great song like ""Forever And A Day"".  Sure this album is no Sgt. Pepper's, but no one has touched The Beatles.  So I highly reccomend this album to people who have heard the Offspring before.  But if you are just starting to enter the Offspring's world, I would suggest Smash for a better feel.  After you get Ignition and if you really like it, their self titled is right up there with it"
1,"I used to like these guys, but the more songs I hear by Minor Threat and TSOL, the more I realize how the Offspring were just copycats.  What a discrace to punk.  I wish bands like the Offspring, Good Charlotte, Green Day, Blink 182, Simple Plan, and New F@g glory would just (...) off!  The only ""American Idiots"" are the ones that buy into this boy band poser punk.  ""WE'RE JUST A MINOR THREAT!"
5,"I had this record when I was little so when I saw it out on cd I had to buy it for my kids.  We loved it this holiday season.  It took me way back in time and was just as much fun now as it was then.  All Christmas, every time we got in the car my kids wanted to hear it.  If you like Christmas, you will like this cd."
1,"The title of that song is ""Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)"" by Baz Luhrmann. It is sometimes also called ""The Graduation Song."" Thought I'd help you all out"
1,The only song I liked off the soundtrack was The Royal Crown song the rest were kind of bland
5,"It's a thrill when a veteran musician puts it all together and every track is a keeper.  Jimmy Smith plays to his strengths (great organ riffs) and gets help from a lot of equally talented friends.  GREAT vocals on this album, sax and guitar.  A real pleasure, among my top jazz albums.  If you you're a long time jazz fan or looking to buy your first jazz album, Jimmy Smith DotCom Blues ought to be on the top of your want list"
5,"I'm no longer as ignorant about public policy and processes and the government as I was when I started listening to the likes of ""Suffer"" and ""Against the Grain"". Now I don't protest things or show support by voicing my opinions for all to hear or through public action like a pretentious prick, but now I do it by voting and posting crappy reviews. And I don't totally agree with Bad Religion like I used to, but, I gotta hand it to them, they definitely  churned out another great album and I love the songs. ""Beyond Electric Dreams"", ""Los Angeles is Burning"", ""Sinister Rouge"", ""God's Love"" are all great. I say, you don't have to support the band view on the current issues and whatnot, but show the love for the band and their musical talent"
5,"Larson's last two efforts (Watercolor Sky, Sepia) were both outstanding, polished albums with Hank Linderman at the helm.  This album is more ""raw"" and stripped down in style.  More of Jeff's contemporary edge comes through on Two Part Confessional, as if Linderman is giving him more production input in the final mixes.  ""Looking at December"" has more of a solo acoustic singer-songwriter sound than we heard before.  ""Maybe Cascade Idaho"" fully has that Beach Boys/Brian Wilson sound Jeffery Foskett brings to the table and as such, more of a Foskett than Linderman sound. ""A Better Day"" sounds more like an America song than Gerry Beckley has done in decades, and since he co-wrote and sang strong backing vocals, it really bears his presence well. ""The Way Outside"" recalls 1973 Eagles/Walsh/Fogelberg ballads, which Linderman has successfully duplicated with his production style. ""Play Through"" has a AAA radio sound to it, with expressive acoustic guitars and simple tight e.guitar, drums & bass.  ""Only Green"" is a beautiful ballad (i.e. Souveniers), and the electic guitar production is remeniscent of Bruce Gaitsch (Richard Marx, Timothy Schmit) on some of his solo work.  A surprise addition comes after the end, as a short instrumental ensues, no doubt the type of thing that usually winds up on the cutting room floor.  All in all a very satisfying group of songs, not a bad one in the lot, which I find amazing in today's music. "
1,"After the nu-metal ship sunk, Dez got rid of Coal Chamber (another terrible band) and started this awful band to keep the paychecks flowing.  In doing this, he's making us think he's a death/black metal fan, but I know that he's nothing more than a run-of-the-mill trend-hopper.  Now to the music, it's lame, watered-down ""metal"" made for the kids who listen to Trivium, Slipknot, and Korn.  Listen to Kreator's ""Enemy of God"" for a WAY better metal album from 2005"
5,"DevilDriver really improved with the release of their dynamic sophomore album ""The Fury of our Maker's Hand"". This CD is excellent. The guitar riffs are amazing, and Dez Fafara is definitely unique with his vocals. The tracks vary in speed, whether it's the up-tempo of ""Hold Back The Day"" or ""Driving Down the Darkness"", or the doomy ""Sin and Sacrifice"". ""Grinf**ked"" is definitely the standout track and a definite anthem. Recommended if you like it heavy.  P.S. This isn't ""brutal death metal"". Brutal death metal is stuff like Devourment, Saprogenic, Gorgasm, etc. Just so that you know."
2,"If you have never heard Mecano before, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE. The new songs are garbage at best. And even as a greatest hits collection, this fails. Buy all of the albums except this one. The best albums to buy for a new listener are &quot;entre el cielo y suelo&quot; and &quot;descanso dominical&quot;. This features 7 new tracks, 1 remake, and 22 of the classics (but they left off several of their all time greatest like &quot;cuervas de esa chica&quot; y &quot;laika&quot; y &quot; el cine&quot;). I give it 2 stars because I have so much respect for the work they've done in the past. But this was a really lame production"
1,"Steve Perry came thru good, but the instrumentation was lousy, and this is remastered! Pfoohey! My vynyl is better. I want my money back. Don't think I'll buy Legacy products again"
1,"These guys haven't put a good album out since Floored.  Lemonade and Brownies is a great metal album and by far their best.  Once &quot;Fly&quot; was a hit, it ruined their sound and they completely sold their souls and sold out their old fans.  When I heard the first single off this album, I almost cried to see how low this band has gone.  I can't believe Mark McGrath was in that Angel's Song for Sevendust.  Now there's a metal band that still puts out good hard albums"
1,"A missed opportunity by Bruce Springsteen to produce Live Box-Set Two. Unlike ""Live 1975 to 1985"", he could of balanced the ledger from his first live project with a much better selection from the final ten shows at Madison Square Garden 2000. At this stage in his career it would not be important to master a selection of live takes from different dates and venues. Instead, a vast repertoire of his music was performed at this one venue, according to the set lists of these ten shows. If Bruce saw this and implemented it, this could have set the record straight with his fans and the bootleggers. A fan's dream I suppose. Otherwise a poor live CD capitalizing on the margin of time it took to release the much better DVD product. It is obvious that some of the most important live songs were included as an afterthought.  I have no problem with Bruce's politics but I am disappointed with the quality of his recent releases on CD. In the end, this is what matters most to me as a fan of the Boss.      "
5,This cd is incredible.  I love their style and the vocals are superb! I will continue to purchase more of their music.
4,"When this CD came out, I ordered it immediately, without watching the movie first. Since I live in Holland and the movie wasn't out here yet. I'm a huge fan of John Powell's scores and I'm glad (again) I bought this score.   The score sounds a little bit like 'The Italian Job' with a spanish flavour to it, because of the percussion and the accoustic guitars. Although the tracks are new and refreshing, I found out that small pieces of music in the film are not on the cd. Like: the 'house fight' part with al the percussion instruments. It's on the cd ('Kiss and Make Up - I believe), and it's a brilliant piece of percussion, but it's not the same as in the movie (that sounded better to me).   Second: the cd is a little on the short side. The total play length of the soundtrack is only 44 minutes. A lot of tracks (20) all relatively short, but... different. So you'll get a lot of different tracks swinged at your ears without to much repeating melody's. Something to get used to after listening to the more monotone Bourne Identity soundtrack.  Nevertheless a brilliant soundtrack, a must have for the John Powell score fans!  (sorry for the dutch-english) grtz, from Holland"
5,"Make It Big is one of the two WHAM! albums with the other being Music From the Edge of Heaven. Of all the three albums released by WHAM!, Make It Big is the better one of the three. With three number one hits including ""Careless Whisper"", Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go"" and ""Everything She Wants"". Another song that made the top 5 is ""Freedom"" ranking at #3. All of the songs on the album r my favorites so i don't have a clear cut favorite. Everyone else haz said wut i wanted to say so there's no use in repeating it except thta i HIGHLY EMPHASIZE that if u r an 80s music lover or love to listen to pop in particular, then u MUST get this album"
2,"PRODUCTION SUCKS THE LIFE OUTTA THIS RELEASE. GIVES ME A HEADACHE. WHINING, WHINING...THE VOCALS ARE REAL PATHETIC. SAVE YOUR MONEY"
1,"See above for reviews that pinpoint some of the problems with this album.  Production quality (or uniquely bad production choices), lack of musical enthusiasm, appalling lack of catchy tunes or lyrics from a band I thought had true capabiities --pick the flaw that bugs you the most.  Any way you slice it this album is a stinker.  Better luck next time CYHSY.  (Your first album was gold.)  Consumers: make sure to listen to those samples before you buy this one.  If you are looking for more great songs like the ones on their first effort then this isn't it.  I'm convinced that the band knew what they had made this time around and that the title, ""Some Loud Thunder,"" must be a witty, veiled reference to flatulence.   "
5,This is a very good collection I stumbled across and has the original (and pretty much best) versions of all the hits - and I disagree with the last reviewer who cited &quot;Chega de Saudade&quot; as being bad without the  lyrics - it's one of my favorites and is such a perfect tune that it needs  no lyrics!  Get this album if you are even slightly interested in Bossa  Nova - it has quickly become one of my staples..
1,"I liked very much the film Black Orpheus, but when I bought this record I hoped to listen the music, not the movie. Most of the tracks has sounds of the movie overimposed to the songs, as would be heard in the movie. Then why not buying the movie? When I listen a cd I care about music, that is contaminated in this record.  And doesn't help neither that songs are changed abruptly frequently. Besides, the art of the cover is very poor, dishonors the movie, and the written comments claim that the sounds of the movie are a plus, recalling the scenes of the movie were the sounds appear, improperly: the ""Oh No!"" sound of ""Frevo"" that is commented does not apear in the movie as said.  As a summary, Verve did wonderfull editions of jazz, but this edition falls far behind the standards of both Verve and the film; clearly, Brazilian music doesn't seems to be Verve territory judging buy this edition"
5,"this warts and all is much better than warts and all volume one..the highlights include a 25 minute version of Kids, a very good timmy tucker and some other extended jams which were good as hel"
5,"If you are tired of the usual guitar playing, with all its already extremely used ways, but don't want to give up listening rock'n'roll, you really should get this album. Not only a guitar player, but also a  songwriter growing after each work, he can give you rock at the best level,  and at the same time showing something new, that will not sound strange to  your years. That's a difficult task you have to admit. And if you think  that this is all, you should get his last online album &quot; Ulysses  (della notte)&quot; even better than this"
1,this was the worst music that sounded like david bowie.  i can't believe these guys have even gotten a record deal....oh the humanit
2,"Daz Nigga Daz & Kurupt the Kingpin are clearly gone. When you hear quality material like ""Dogg Food"" and then switch to this ""Saga"" CD... One has to wonder where the effort went?  It's always a treat to see Daz and Kurupt together doing stuff. They've accomplished a bit on solo projects and dualing on other albums. But this one was a rush-to-the-studio. Daz- has he changed this much? His talent levels have kept him bringing stylish beats in the past- very jazzy, funky with many instruments felt. That's all gone now..... Now it's bass, bass, bass with lost chorus direction and no style.  Daz's delivery isn't even what it use to be. The pitch is very high all the time, even if the production doesn't call for it. Kurupt back in the studio on this one is nice. But we get a lost focus with so many destractions. And what's clearly missing is the other lineups- no Soopafly, Snoop, Nate, Mr. Malik, Bad Azz... so forth. I know, I know that DPGC album is coming out to reveal that all. Well Daz & Kurupt should've waited instead of damaging their album archive.  Album had a couple of nice ones. Overall, not at the level of their capability.."
5,"I guess ""Bible of Dreams"", Juno Reactor's bold foray into territory beyond their techno days, contains the best sounds. Aw, who am I kidding? It's the greatest album in the history of the universe!!!  1) Jardin de Cecile - 4/5. You might call it boring; I call it moody. This is not the standard ""calm & slow"" sound of Juno Reactor--in other words, it's not a droning, monotonous pile of neverending bull. This one actually has character, which is maybe not as evident in the first couple of minutes as it is later. We get some atmospheric, echoing notes that have a nice, dreamy quality to them. After a while, percussion joins in, along with this weird ""sweeping"" noise that pops in every few seconds. About five minutes in, the song undergoes a complete change of style and transforms to heavy percussion and a little synth. A nice intro that gives you a taste of things to come. It's like the POV of someone gradually waking up and joining the traffic jam of everyday life. While stoned.  2) Conga Fury - 4/5. You may have heard this in ""The Animatrix"" or ""Mortal Kombat: Annihilation"" (so sorry for mentioning that movie). It starts off with a lone female voice whose harmonizing is soon joined by jungle drums and synth. It continues on with the drums and the synth and the voice until it quiets down and ends the same way it began. And what's really funny is the male voice that kicks in at two minutes. It's somewhat weird and out of place, but it's so hilarious that I can forgive Watkins. ""Huela! Huela! Libalalibalalibalalibala..."" Or whatever he's saying.  3) God is God - 5/5. It's funny. When I first heard ""Pistolero"", I thought that no other Juno Reactor song could ever be as good or better. Kids today, eh? Whatever melancholy quietude existed in the first two songs is completely gone here. We've left the jungle and entered the desert, and does it deliver. Don't be fooled by the spacy sound at the beginning--that soon gives way to a crazy beat with chanting and all the instruments you'd expect in the Middle Eastern culture. There are also sound clips apparently taken from ""The Ten Commandments"", which are weird at first and then as cool as the rest of the song. Sure, it's repetitive, but the main tune is WAY awesome, and as long as we have that...repetition matters not, grasshopper.  4) Komit - 4/5. Not bad at all. A remix of this was heard early on in ""The Matrix Reloaded"", and I must admit, I liked it better there. It begins with a series of notes that give one a sense of flying through the calm night air. I would've liked to hear these notes become more prominent, but alas, only in ""Reloaded"". Here, they stay in the background and let the Juno percussion take over. The song just gets bizarre at times, although the grungy tunes are worth it. That's about all. Overall, this is a more organic version of something you'd hear in ""Transmissions"".  5) Swamp Thing - 4/5. Ah, looks like they're tackling heavy metal. This starts off grungy and gritty, and doesn't let up until it's over. The usual percussion kicks in, and sticks with a sinister tempo for a while. When we hear the guitar solos at approximately 3:30, it seems kinda belated and anticlimactic, especially since they don't go much further than that; we slip right back to the percussion. I'm only giving this a 4 because it's rather catchy.  6) Kaguya Hime - 5/5. This can be compared to ""Swamp Thing"", but it takes itself a lot less seriously. It's got a similar setup and form: percussion accompanied by minimal synth. About forty seconds in, we're introduced to a very playful beat that sounds like the work of hollow drums played by chopsticks. Or something like that. Midway through, the drums ""mature"" into a heavier-sounding variety, with some more synth playing alongside than before. It's still playful, though. In fact, this is a very fun song to listen to if you don't mind a drum being the primary instrument. Reminds me of the final segment of ""Jardin"". I'm only giving this a 5 because it's supremely catchy.  7) Children of the Night - 5/5. And now for something completely different. While the previous six have different styles, one can tell that they're all Juno Reactor works. With this, it might be a little more difficult. At least for me. On the platter is a tune that sounds evil yet fun. Shall we say...giddy. It's very, very giddy. You can imagine an evil force approaching to kill you, but messing with your mind first by sneaking up on you from multiple directions, or filling your mind with images from your worst nightmares. It is giddy. There's not a lot of ways to describe it. Giddiness all around. ""The children of the night are call-eeng...hehehehe...hehehehe..."" accompanied by the sound of puppies allegedly whimpering before their horrible, gas-filled deaths. Brrr. Did I mention it's giddy?  8) Shark - 4/5. I know, I know, it's ""calm & slow"". But it's also not monotonous. If you haven't figured out from the title, this conveys an underwater feeling to the listener. It's very mellow and trancy, and in some parts, definitely reminiscent of Vangelis' opening score for ""Blade Runner"". It's down-time for the entire song, although there is a rough patch that's supposed to resemble a tectonic plate breaking apart or something. Ruins the calmness, I think. The length is another problem; it's over nine-and-a-half minutes long. When a song doesn't have a lot of musical variety, you might wanna shorten it. On the plus side, featured here are a bunch of trippy sound effects that sound underwater-ish, but I don't really know why. Without these sounds, this song is what you'd hear at one of those big aquarium display shows. With the sounds, it's...well...Juno Reactor at its calm & slow finest.  9) High Energy Protons (Orion Mix) - 5/5. I'm fully aware it's a remix. I'm fully suspicious of the guys for being lazy. But that doesn't stop the ""Bible"" finale from ruling. To make it easier for you, I'll just assume that you've already listened to the original version in ""Transmissions"". And by ""easier for you"", I mean ""easier for myself"". Some of the techno sound is still here, but the background choir holds much more presence. Furthermore, there's the addition of a few synth riffs that add another dimension to the whole thing. However, I still like the original mix better. Don't ask why. And if you're wondering about the dialogue clips, they've dropped ""You're going to have a wonderful trip."" All we've got here is ""You're the brain and central nervous system"", ""High energy protons spilling over into our atmosphere"", and ""Everything's going extremely well."" (YES! HAL-9000!!!"
4,"Well, somehow I picked up the Rev's first-ever Christmas album even before the two Brians' 2005 holiday discs (the sainted Wilson and the slick Setzer, that is). As Santa said of Rudolph's first jump at the Reindeer Games in that classic Rankin-Bass ""Rudolph"" special, not bad! Not baaaad! There are a lot of cool and interesting goodies in this Christmas stocking, enough to please most of the Whos at your local Whoville. The disc has a chunk of Chuck Berry, and not just the album-closing ""Run Rudolph Run"" (with the Rev, aka guitarist Jim Heath, trading instruments with his bassist, Jimbo Wallace). It actually starts with track 1, the full-tilt boogie-woogie version of ""Frosty the Snowman."" The credits don't list the pianist, but ""Winter Wonderland"" also has a lot of that Berry/Johnnie Johnson interplay, straight out of ""You Never Can Tell."" There's also a bit of blazing Berry/Johnson boogie-woogie sharing space in the unlikeliest of places: alongside a mad-mod-surf ""Batman"" swirl on ""Santa Claus Is Coming to Town."" Other yummy flavors in the Rev's holiday petit fours assortment include a slap-bass rockabilly hoedown instrumental of ""Jingle Bells,"" a Ray Charles-type gospel-meets-country-ballad version of ""Silver Bells,"" a snarky, dirty, bottom-heavy, finger-popping rockabilly swing through ""Rudolph,"" a hoedown of ""Santa on the Roof,"" and an instrumental of ""What Child Is This"" that tosses around country, surf, spaghetti western, even a little bit of Traffic and Hendrix. That's to go along with faithful versions of Elvis' ""Santa Bring My Baby Back"" and Buck Owens' ""Santa Looked a Lot Like Daddy."" The only soft spot is Heath's voice. The Rev's rasp is well suited for his patented rockaswingapunkabilly raveups, but certainly not smooth enough for the likes of ""Silver Bells"" and ""Pretty Paper,"" or even ""Santa Bring My Baby Back."" But hey -- you know what? This album is such a high-spirited affair, and the Rev, Jimbo and Scott Churilla, the drummer, have been such good boys this year, that Santa can overlook that shortcoming. They should find a little something extra under their trees for spreading such cheer"
5,"This album has become surprisingly influential.  It was the first album to feature celebrities singing badly.  I remember the first time I heard it; I laughed my head off.  It spawned three sequels and several imitations.  Hey, it even helped revive William Shatner's career!  Of course, Shatner's unforgetable renditions of &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot; and &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; are the highlights here, but there's much more.  Shatner's first mate, Leonard Nimoy, who was the most prolific actor/vocalist (five albums!), has two amazing contributions here.  Everybody's favorite butler, Sebastian Cabot, has two songs from his spoken word album where he overacts Bob Dylan lyrics.  Speaking of overacting Bob Dylan songs, you should here what Eddie &quot;Green Acres&quot; Albert does to &quot;Blowin' in the Wind&quot;.  Jack Webb recites &quot;Try a Little Tenderness&quot; in his best Joe Friday monotone.  I could go on and on, but I will get to the point and say that &quot;this album is hilarious&quot;.  I highly recommend this album to anyone who likes funny music"
1,Two CDs that would fit on one and at a double price. Get another collection
5,"Holy Toledo!  What a mix of unbelievable sounds. From the most haunting melodies to the rockinest guitars ever heard with sounds inbetween you've never imagined.  It's unnerving and riveting and shocking and there's a crazy edge to it that kind of stuns the senses because they can't be sure they're really hearing what they've just heard.  Highly addictive.  Highly unusual but an absolute must have listening experience.  ""Baby's on Fire"" and ""Cindy tells me"" are worth the price by themselves.      I can't live without cranking this thing up two or three times a month and listening to it 2-3 times straight.      I'm going to shut up now because I have to go listen to it again.  All the cudos from other reviewers here are dead on.  This is one amazing album that I will be drawn to 30 years from now and I've had the vinyl since '74.  The CD is perfection. This is an underground classic"
1,"I purchashed this CD remix single thinking it was a medley of the original songs, but it turns out it is just Prince remaking his old hits and blending them together.  It's a little deceitful that it doesn't say on the CD that these are re-recorded versions.  Very disappointing"
2,"I've tried to make it through the album twice and I'm bored to tears with these songs. Maybe it will sound better on a cold rainy day. I so wanted to enjoy this album, but can't seem to get into the versions of these songs. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone but a die-hard fan."
1,The problem with this CD is their is another CD called &quot;The Singles&quot; which contains all these songs and more. The only song left out is &quot;Wind Beneath My Wings.&quot; True Sheena's version is far  superior to Bette Midler's it is better to buy the CD &quot;Machinery&quot;  from where the song was pulled
5,"If you buy this CD, listen to ""Riff Raff"" on 10, and your not convinced of the absolute transcendent beauty of the dirty-band-of-demons that was AC/DC at this time in history, you must be dead.  Although it's quite short and doesn't have the songs you might expect to see, this is an absolutely crucial document of the quintessential bad boys in their prime"
2,"I just got this at a bargain price from Amazon.co.uk. Its great for completists and Meek collectors, and even for those who want to know about girl singers or production methods of the 1960s. But it's not very listenable. There are about four really good tracks on it, and no stars with the possible exception of Glenda Collins"
5,"I got this cd almost exactly a year after hearing &quot;Not Pretty Enough&quot; on a sampler cd I got from purchasing a present for someone. I immediatly fell in love with the song, mainly because it put my feelings into words about someone. After listening to the one song for a year, my boyfriend finally got me Barricades and Brickwalls for christmas. It's awesome, and I'm listening to it now! Her voice is amazing, with a touch of breathiness that adds to the overall effect. The lyrics are another thing, so thoughtfully written out and sung from her own heart. She actually wrote the songs herself. I've never been a country fan, but the cd is making me change my view (very slowly!). I love this girl"
5,"There's a difference between an o.k. album and a good one, All Mod Cons is neither, All Mods Con is a masterpeice. it has a level of quality that few albums have, great songs, great production, and great fade ins and fade outs, no this is not just a collection of songs all laced together in any random order.  A very well thought out sequence has the album's lone cover The 60's-ish psychedelic/mod/pop sound that is David Watts (a Kinks song) followed, by &quot;English Rose&quot;'s acoustic guitar and ocean waves, And when the singing kicks in, and thats when it hits you how good this album really is.  &quot;In the crowd&quot;'s bass lines, guitar riffs, and melodies, is one of the many gentle gems in the album.  And then just when you think you're listening to a 60's pop album, &quot;Billy Hunt&quot;'s Guitar intro punches in, reminding you, The Jam were many things, including a great Punk Band.  Well I guess i should end there, thats Tracks 4-7. but I should mention my favorite tracks right now are (2) &quot;To be someone (didn't we have a nice time)&quot; and (8) &quot;It's too Bad&quot; but honestly the whole album is a pleasure to hear from the &quot;1,2,3,4&quot; Whisper/intro to the haunting closer &quot;Down in the the Tube Station at Midnight.&quot; Albums just don't get better than this one, folks"
2,"The music in this CD is beautiful, the lyrics are lovely as well. The fact that I don't like Michael Crawfords' voice might have something to do with this...Gerard Butler was the first Phantom I heard.... so I hold my standards to him. Michael Crawfords' voice is nice, I'll admit, but give me Gerry any day. Perhaps Michael DID have a voice suited for the role, and perhaps Gerard Butler didn't, but I'm partial to emotional songs to wooden-flat ones, and baritone voices to tenor voices. Sarah has a lovely voice, but in my opinion, it is a bit too mature for the part of a 16 year old girl.  But don't let this stop you-buy this CD...you may love it, you may hate it. Just compare Michael's voice to Gerard's voice...the difference is rather laughable"
5,"THIS ALBUM KICKS A*S, if you can't handle Angus Young in your face with amazing guitar solos then your p*ssy a*s needs too find music like Garth Brooks S*IT!"
5,"Wow / Grape Jam is incomplete. So is Columbia Legacy's Vintage. Answer....Buy both albums (Amazon's other buying options still has some copies of Vintage for around $15/disc - which in California is a third of a fill up for a camery).Take the best cuts of both, and put them on a blank disc (the only song you wont have is the (very spacy) the Lake, and the announcement to turn your platter speed from 33 1/3 to 78 for Just Like Gene Autry, a foxtrot that was on the original WOW album.  This album reminds me a lot of Buffalo Springfield Again. Pungiant little gems from a rapidly disintegrating band.  Enjoy.  Incidentally, you can do this, add The Place And The Time (original version - from Vintage), Miller's Blues (Live - from Vintage), and still have around 7 minutes to mess around with. Great for a car backup"
2,Nice listening and partying music from a seemingly low-brow but funny and wise movie
1,"Completely disappointed. No soul, no tradition. Save your money unless you're into UB40 and synthesized reggae...ugh. It is all to obvious why there are no samples of this CD on the web page. I took one for the team...buyer beware. SUPPORT LOCAL MUSIC"
5,"This is one of my top 10 CDs of all time. Check out my other reviews and you'll probably be surprised. But this CD left a lasting impression on me when i was like 16 or so. It has some of the most well-crafted SY songs in my opinion and some of the sweetest, sublime, fuzzed out guitar sounds ever.  Track 1 is the perfect song. Track 2 (Junkie's Promise) rocks harder than anything they've ever done. They played it on Conan Obrien and tore it up!!! Track 3 is beautfully hypnotic in a tripped out sort of way. This is the track that first reeled me in as I was under the influence of Wild Irish Rose watching my friends play Tekken 2. Track 4 (washing machine) is a very episodical and visual song which morphs from dischordant punk to a chill summery breeze of a jam that slowly winds down into practically nothing. Kim Gordon's snotty tuff girl attitude shines through more than ever on songs like 'Little Trouble Girl' and 'Panty Lies'. How can any true fan of alternative music hate this CD? Good experimentation with noise and distortion, yet structured songs... better than previous ""Expermmental Jet Set"" album. Give it a whir"
4,"Snoop Dogg is one of my favorite rappers. I've grown up listening to him since I was a child while he was rhyming on Dr. Dre's ""The Chronic"". I've even stuck by him when he put out bad albums (""The Game Is Sold..."") and when he dropped a decent album (""Paid The Cost...""). ""The Blue Carpet Treatment"" would probably be his best in over a decade if you ask me.  This album is full of laced beats and good rhymes. ""Think About It"" comes off real strong from Snoop laced with a dope beat. The radio hit ""Thats That..."" with R. Kelly gives listeners a nice R&B tune to listen to. As well as the other hit ""I Wanna Love You"" with Akon, another hit for this album.   As I said in my title, this is what ""Cali Iz Active"" should have sounded like. That CD was so horrible and failed to follow it's concept. This album followed what that concept should have been. Most of the guest appearances are form Cali. ""Candy"" would feature Goldie Loc, MC Eiht, E-40, and The Dogg Pound, and a real nice tune to ride to. ""LAX"" with Ice Cube is another standout tune that featured a sample from Biggie's ""Going Back To Cali"" in the hook. I'd say for some reason, my favorite song is toward the end with ""Imagine"" with Dr. Dre. and D'Angelo. Possibly because that piano laced throughout the song. Snoop would close the album with ""Conversations"" with Stevie Wonder, showing off that he's trying to get his mind right. Other guests include The Game, B-Real from Cypress Hill, George Clinton, and Kam (where the hell have YOU been Kam???).  Although this is a good CD I've heard from Snoop in a minute, it still has some rough parts. ""10 Lil' Crips"" sounded kinda weak to me. And I wasn't feeling the song ""Beatin' Up On Yo Pads"" although it's a positive song about him coaching and playing football, but it's a good song, so I'll make it my honorable mention track.  If you heard that this album was his most consistant since ""Doggystyle"", you heard correct. We're more than aware that he's not going to drop another one of those albums, but this is a real good one from Snoop. If other west coast artists drop albums like this, we might have the West Coast making a comeback. And being a fan of West Coast rap music, I am more than ready for it. If you thought Snoop fell off, well he gives doubters ""Tha Blue Carpet Treatment"".  Lyrics: A- Production: A- Guest Appearances: A- Musical Vibes: B Overall: A-  My Favorite Tracks From This Album: Think About It, Thats That..., Candy (Drippin' Like Water), Gangbangn 101, LAX, Which One Of You, I Wanna [Love] You, Psst!, Imagine, Converstions  Honorable Mention Track: Beatin' On Yo Pads  Peace Everyone!!"
1,"Purple City's debut release is ""The Purple Album"" (2006). Having made their mark on the mixtape scene the Dipset affiliate trio of Emperor Shiest Bub, Un Kasa & Don Bishop Agallah provide this release. The Harlem trio start off the album with ""Live Your Life"" repping their group and thanking the Diplomats for paving the way, the best part of this track for me is the chorus. The typical ""Gangsta"" has Shiest Bub collaborating with Jim Jones and Max B backed by the kind of beat that will put you to sleep, the verses are equally boring. Laidback ""Fly High"" follows, backed by some mellow production Purple City pays tribute to smoking weed in what turns out to be a smooth cut. I don't know if Purple City is paying tribute to the South movement, or trying to capitalize on it with ""Trap N****"" either way it's a weak attempt to sound like Young Jeezy, its actually disturbing. ""Go Head"" follows Purple City proclaims being gangster again on another halfhearted cut. ""Nick Nack"" is a lame attempt at a club track, horrible chorus. Tec, Steele and Buckshot drop in for the grimy ""Hustlers"".  Agallah, Un Kasa and affiliate Ike Eyes  team up for another bland cut with ""Picture Me Rollin"". Shiest Bub collabs with A-Mafia on ""Head Bust Open"" rhyming in a braggy manner while warning not to mess with Purple City.  Purple City's decides to spell things out again on ""P.A.Y.D.A.Y."".  While ""Grind Slow"" feat. Buddy Klein is a below average cut where the group talk to the ladies.  Shiest Bub closes the album off with ""Catch Him"" repping himself.  Lyrically this group is not entertaining or original - listening to them I feel like I have heard it all somewhere else before. None of them have distinct flows and production is average.  If you love Dipset and are into that whole movement you may like this. This may sound brutal but listening to the ""The Purple Album"" to me is like watching a bad B Movie, not worth my time. "
2,I was disappointed in the quality of the recording. The needle noise in the recording was more prevalent than on a c.d. that I had burned from an old vinyl record
1,This album is garbage.  I love in flames and i can't find anything nice to say about this album except that when thrown from a moving car it flies really nice and shatters into a million pieces
1,Does anybody have the Live album recorded @ Carnegie Hall??? What a great record that one was.....But I`ve seen it no where...........
1,ITEM NEVER RECEIVED. IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTACT BY EMAIL THE CUSTOMER SERVICE. MY LAST PURCHASE ON AMAZON 
5,"When I first heard this album it captured me.  Now that I've expanded my House collection my tastes have changed a little, but I still consider this to be a stellar Deep House album.  There are enough memorable tracks on this 2-disc set to easily justify owning it.  My favorites are ""Waiting"", ""Next To Me"", ""Don't Stand There"", ""Don't Change"", ""You Can't Stop"", ""Petalpushing"", ""The Remedy"", and ""Lionel's Jam"" (in that order).  I own just about everything Migs has put out and I consider this to be his best.  If I may drop a sales pitch for a couple of his other works it would be Jay-J & Miguel Migs - In The House and Miguel Migs - Colorful You.  This latter one has some incredible R&B tracks.  My only criticism of Miguel Migs is that some of his tracks have too much Reggae and Latin/Jazz for my tastes.  Nevertheless, he is one of the best DJ/Producers I've ever heard.   "
1,"For some reason there seem to be three versions of this album listed separately for sale on Amazon.  One of them only has 13 tracks.  Be sure to get the version with 14 tracks because the 14th track is too good to miss.  ""Down the Line"" is one of the live songs and you absolutely want to have that cut.  This review seems to appear in several versions of the albu"
1,uninspired and down right boring. I feel I wasted over an hour of my life listening to this disc..
4,"Being a fan of mostly punk rock music... I decided to give this a try. This record is highly entertaining, very fun and very original. I didnt even know that &quot;gypsy-punk&quot; existed untill I heard this. The musicianship is quite good as well. Chanty, boot stompin' songs with accordians and fiddles. I like it. I reccomend this if you like the more folky brands of punk rock (ie Swingin' Utters, Tossers, etc.) So, if you're willing to give something different a try, go ahead and pick this up"
4,"This double cd is awsome! Nick Warrens mixing ability is so awsome and it earns the Global Underground name.  The cd is pretty dark and the songs are not popular club hits, but if you buy this, you shouldnt be expecting it.  This cd really puts me into a trance and i love listening to it, expecially when im driving. I would totally buy this cd to mix up your collection"
1,"I ran out and bought this cd the very day it came out.  Then sat listening anxiously for something to stir inside of me.  Alas, nothing.  A few weeks later, still nothing.  A month later, I tried again.  I yawned...  Then I got up and cleaned the kitchen finding that more interesting.  When I first started listening to Zero 7, I was drawn, pulled, attached to their music.  I got it, it got me--we connected.  My friend Mel asked me the other day how this cd was and I let her listen to it; she yawned and said, ""I guess they've lost it"".  Should they release another cd, I'd borrow it from the library first and then buy it only if I really love it.  But this cd was deeply disappointing.."
5,That cd is just touching and well made by Zero 7. Zero 7 is awsome and I am your fan also. Thank you for so much.
5,"** This CD is really my favorite, even above the Fred and Mary Mary. Also even above the mass choirs, this CD is my favorite because of its closeness and realness to me. Not only does Canton Jones get you crunk, but you can realy feel the lyrics because of their truth and accuracy in this generation. You can't help but be lifted, be drawn, and get ""bout it"" for Christ!   "
5,"O.K. folks here we go, from an ex- Santa Barbara disc jockey to you. The best song on this excellent CD is Las Vegas Tango. What should blow your mind about this song is the multirhythmic backing of Elvin Jones on drum. The band itself is tight and strong. The song is kinda haunting. I've hummed it to myself for the past forty years, and after losing the album a while back, I bought a new CD of it through Amazon.com from England, and I am very happy I own it. I think everyone should own at least one of this, one for themselves and one to give to a friend. This album, and particularly Las Vegas Tango, is one of the best outputs of any band during the 20th century. Buy it"
1,"this album is terrible.  just useless noise.  i also own electric pink and very emergency.  if you liked those albums, you will agree that this one is garbage"
5,"Just can't praise this CD too highly.  I usually stick with classical music (Mozart, Stamitz etc) but this CD,has opened up a whole new dimension.  I just play it over and over.  Never get tired of it."
5,"If you love all things James Brown, then you must buy this collection of funky hits (tinged with more than a hint of jazz) he did with his 70's band, the JBs.  Believe me, you will not be able to resist the beat! The excellent horn work of Maceo Parker and Fred Wesley are worth the price of the CD alone. The majority of the cuts are R&amp;B dancing and roller skating classics, especially, &quot;(It's Not The Express) It's The JBs Monorail&quot;, &quot;Gimme Some More&quot;, &quot;Pass The Peas&quot;, &quot;Same Beat&quot;, and &quot;Damn Right, I'm Somebody&quot;.  &quot;Think&quot;, with vocals by Lyn Collins, is just too funky for words.  Don't pass this one by"
5,"Now I know everybody would love this CD.  It is definately for the young AND old.  The tracks sound great and the new liner notes are amazing.  A great mix of Loverboy's best hits, including Working For the Weekend!!"
1,I had to return this album to Amazon after receiving an emil from them stating that it contained Sony malware.  Poor Jane! Caught up with these creeps! 
2,When I got this cd I thought it was the music from the first version and that is the main reason I bought it. Its an ok cd just not my taste in music
1,"michelle zacharias , i totally agree with you. I can believe the ruined such a good movie qith such a terrible ending, Im looking for the hollywood version as well, for I think that jacqes should have learnt the lesson with enzos suicide and value life, especially when he is going to have a child from the beautifull woman he loves"
2,I have searched and searched for Bill Conti's alternate motion picture score and I have had no luck.  Does anyone know how to find Bill Conti's Soundtrack Specialist?  Eric Serra's score was good but I was disappointed when I purchased it and it was NOT what I thought I bought.  Email me at mszacharias@yahoo.com if anyone has any information on how to find it.  Thanks
1,"I can't believe people like Eazy-E more than Dr.Dre. Dre is way better than sleazy-e. Stay with Dre, not sleazy-e"
2,"...but I listen to them even less!  I bought this album at random a few years ago.  My first impression after I bought it was &quot;mediocre British band&quot;.  I've listened to it a couple times since then, the most recent today, and my impression hasn't changed.  If it weren't for the fact that Brian Eno contributed to this album I'd probably give it one star"
2,"Only"", the second single from ""With Teeth"", has something in common with its predecessor-- its of limited value. I picked it up and was pretty disappointed.  The single itself, ""Only"", isn't one of the ones I particularly enjoy on the album-- its got a nice enough funky bass line and drum beat, but Reznor's sing-speak ""Down In It"" styled vocal grates and the piece doesn't particularly hold my interest. Certainly it lacks the immediacy of ""Down In It"", and I'm generally inclined to want Reznor to look forward, not backward.  The b-sides aren't much better-- the DFA mix of ""The Hand That Feeds"" is yet another remix, this one pretty much a full techno mix. It's quite different, replete with an odd panting sample that gets somewhat irritating as the piece never ends (it rambles on for well over seven minutes). The live version of ""Love is Not Enough"" is the only saving grace on the single-- while its not one of the better songs on the record, its decent enough, and live it got bigger. The arrangement is the same, but its more direct and in your face.  For the casual listener, skip this one. The fan will be buying it regardless of what I say, but it's in line with the recent singles, not the older (and superior) ones"
2,"Someone pointed out in another review that the songs are presented in the original mono versions.  More than that, I also have the Chartbusters (12 cds) Mowtown compilation and in addition some old vinyl recordings, and I have noticed that the actual _mixes_ are not even the same as the original recordings.  For instance, on Stevie Wonder's ""For Once In My Life"" and Glady Knight and the Pips' ""I Heard It Through The Grapevine"" there are parts that are just plain missing.  I'm very disappointed, as my favorite songs do not sound at all as I remember them. Update:  I listened again.  I think I might have been mistaken when I said that parts were just plain missing.  I think it's just that the mono versions actually bury things that come across more clearly in the stereo versions.  It just a shame that the original record company couldn't have done a better job in light of the advent of the CD"
5,"I have been listening to Jazz for 31 years now, and have not discovered a better album than this.  You get Miles in his prime, Trane AND Cannonball,  and a rhythm section that was just SICK.  Every track swings.  Every note is ON.  Do yourself a favor: GET THIS CD RIGHT NOW!!"
2,"I grew up listening to her ""In Concert"" album, and bought the Pearl album based on reviews saying this was a more mature style for her music.  I like her old style better, this sounds like she was trying to make a more pop sound for her music (although the singing wasn't much different).  It not only didn't sound like what you expect from Janice Joplin, it sounded like a muzak imitation of her"
5,"Ralph Stanley is a God of bluegrass and this CD shows us why. The man's voice has such character and presence and power. The music is as good as bluegrass gets and the harmonies are great.  There is a good variety of music on this CD. From barn burners to slow mournful dirges, its all here. You wouldnt think that an album full of songs about death would be uplifting, but it is.  Highly Recommended"
2,"My mistake. I had only heard ""Should've Been The One"" which I thought sounded very good. That, however, was the only song produced in the studio and unfortunately the only song I liked enough to justify the purchase. The rest of the songs are live, apparently recorded at a small venue, if you can judge by the applause. Like I said...my fault. Not saying any of the songs are bad. Maybe more of them will grow on me. Just not what I expected. Moral: it pays to listen to most of a CD before you buy it.(duh) You never know what you're gonna get"
5,"I bought this album when I was 17. I'm now 31 and I still haven't recovered! This album, as said before, represents the indie punk ideal only feinted at by Nirvana, Sonic Youth etc. Steve Albini and co assault you here with a white-hot mind-melting onslaught  of musical savagery, from the beserk guitar-driven Colombian Necktie through the nosebleed-inducing Pavement Saw to the juddering, sinister colossus of Tiny, King of the Jews. Sheer uncompromising overbuilt punk, this represents Big Black at their zenith. With bands like this in the world there's no excuse for mediocrity"
5,"If forced to pick one band that best exemplified the indie-rock aesthetic, one would be hard-pressed to find a better choice than Big Black.  Many of the acts typically credited with bringing alternative music to the mainstream have, for better or worse, been little more than angry pop acts (Nirvana and Nine Inch Nails being prominent examples), and even many more underground acts such as Pixies, Sonic Youth, and the Jesus Lizard released some material that was palatable to the mainstream, as their major-label runs attest.  Big Black, on the other hand, was the real deal, a band that lived out the indie philosophy in both their music and in their resolutely do-it-yourself business practices, and paid the commercial price for it.  Songs About F***ing was the perfect distillation of leader Steve Albini's philosophy: an abrasive, confrontational album that contained no concessions to the mainstream and no pretensions to socially redeeming value.  This is music at its most twisted and evil, acknowledging no taboos as it challenged listeners to take or leave its assaultive sound and unpleasant lyrical content.    The key to the lasting appeal of this release lies largely in its simplicity.  Like fellow pioneering noise-merchants Godflesh, Big Black distilled rock music to its most basic elements: guitar, bass, and drum machine.  In spite of this minimal approach, however, Songs About F***ing is hardly palatable or unchallenging.  What emerges from this combination of rock's traditional elements is a barrage of scathing, disembowling noise that pummels eardrums with a mix of astringent guitar squalls and pulsating industrial beasts.  And of course, it's all topped off with the demented vocal stylings of Albini himself, making Kurt Cobain sound like Mel Torme as he howled and screamed his tales of depravity.    Mixing metal, punk, and the then-burgeoning genre of industrial with reckless abandon, Songs About F***ing constitutes a musical roller coaster of frightening proportions, and wraps things up in barely half an hour.  The basslines and drum programming of Bad Penny and Colombian Necktie are enough to crack skulls, while Albini's vocals legitimately bring to mind a man in the midst of a nervous breakdown.  L-Dopa is all punkish speed and aggression but infinitely more frightening, and the proto-industrial rage of Precious Thing and Kasimir N. Pulaski Day would send Trent Reznor up a tree.  Even when the band slows down, as on Kitty Empire, the results are clenched, sinister, and intense.  Tiny, King of the Jews (love that title) actually manages to be somewhat atmospheric, but it still relies heavily on that mix of disconcerting guitar noise and pulsating beats.  I've listened to pretty much every noted act in the extreme-music world, from Slayer to Godflesh to Meshuggah, and Big Black may have been the scariest of all.  And Songs about F***ing in an unqualified triumph, one that oozes menace and integrity at the same time.  Own it, or pose"
4,"First off, consider the packaging. The title SONGS ABOUT F--KING rendered in loving bold, and cover art that puts all ""shock rockers"" (that means you, Marilyn Manson) in their place. That alone makes it worth adding to your collection. Too bad this was the band's last release. Leave it to Steve to break a band up just as they were attracting an audience.    Big Black is pure nihilism in audio form. A young Steve Albini (pre-Shellac and before he was reduced to producing Bush albums) backed by a constantly pulsing drum machine named Roland and furiously feedback-driven guitar noise while ranting his stories of Midwest depravity and illness with an almost infectious glee. This is what happens when Kraftwerk goes to hell (they even cover that German duo's The Model here), or when a bunch of angry, drunk, baseball bat-wielding nerds start playing New Wave while setting a trailer park on fire. Though there have been faster bands, heavier bands, nobody has ever sounded so gritty and hateful as these guys do.    Ah.. enough hyperbole. So, why only four stars (actually 4.5)? Well, there's nothing as great as previous albums' Steelworker, Bad Houses, Kerosene, or Jordan, Minnesota--songs that are so definitive of Big Black's style. However, there are plenty of songs that come awful close: The poppy yet deliciously evil Bad Penny (""I think I f--ked your girlfriend once, maybe twice, I don't remember""), the demented almost-surf rock of Columbian Necktie, the eerie proto-industrial grind of Kitty Empire, the vicious Fish Fry, and the lovely free-floating hostility of Tiny, King Of The Jews. Also notable is a cover of Cheap Trick's He's A Whore that strips away the innuendo and leaves just the grimy sleaze.   Essential music for the misanthrope in all of us. Also recommended highly are fellow Touch & Go outfits The Jesus Lizard and Albini's later ""supergroup"" Rapeman."
5,"I'm so thrilled to discover this recording is out on CD as I've worn out my cassette. Brilliant playing, group interaction...the sense of urgency in this performance as Bill neared the end of his life his heart-rending.  I never write reviews but this is one of my favorite albums of all time"
2,"I'd like to start by saying how amazing New American Gospel is.  Then by saying what a solid follow-up As The Palaces Burn is.  Lamb of God is truly one of the best American thrash/metalcore acts.  However, If you enjoy either of their first releases, I would recommend skipping this one.  It's disappointing and generic.  If you're considering buying this and don't own the previous albums, buy them first.  Lamb of God is an aggressive, technically skilled band, and I really expect their next release to be a comeback after this one"
1,"I loved the big guy on American Idol, hell I even voted for him, but this CD is so blah! Everything sounds the same. I can tell the CD was rushed of course, and they thought the tracks would be good just b/c he has a great voice. Ever since he won he's just been goin downhill. And i'm not one for playing the race-card here, but in this case, COME ON! Mr. Girly Man Aiken gets the cover of Rolling Stone and all Ruben gets is the cover of JET?! He was the winner for goodness sake! I guess it all can't be fair. And Hello! has anyone seen the video for Sorry 2004? If a stalker ever had a theme song that one's it. Followin the poor girl,peakin around corners, puh-lease! I couldn't give the CD less than one star, otherwise, baby boy, u woulda got negative NONE! Zip zero, no dinero"
5,"Alan Jackson is truly one of the best new country singers around. I enjoyed his version of all of these songs. He actually sings them better than the original singers, Farewell Party and Kiss An Angel Good Morning are so  well done. I hope  he comes out with another CD of this kind"
1,"Don't buy this album.  You would have to have pretty drab music taste to like this generic, emotionless, tired, garbage.  Merkin Dream is clearly ripping off any worthwhile downtempo group that they find fitting (ie. Massive Attack, Air, Everything But the Girl), plus there is no vocal talent in the 3 songs they actually sing in.  Someone thought Track 7 was funny or cute because a robotic voice says, ""Does my hard drive turn you on?""  What is wrong with you people?  If you want decent robo-pop music, try Kraftwerk, Figurine, or even Ladytron.  My advice to Merkin Dream is to stop making music because you're brainwashing poor children out there into thinking you're something good"
2,"I love George Strait's music.If you look at my profile you will see that I have rated numerouse other cd's of his and gave them all 5 star. He is my favorite artist, but this cd is just plain bad."
5,"Some of this is quite pretty - - ""Kometenmelodie 2"", in fact, waxes practically majestic.  And it's true:  the title track glides along with four wheels off the ground for 22 minutes or so.  And the recorder piece that closes the album (replete with little birdies twittering all over the place) is a bit of a pleasant and unexpected surprise; ""Morgenspaziergang"", after all, translates as ""A Morning Walk"".  Not quite of its time, and slightly before it, you have a bona fide classic here.  Fah'n on."
1,MAN YOU CANT EVEN MAKE OUT MOST OF THE SONG MAKE'S YOU THINK YOUR CD PLAYER IS BUGGING AND NEEDS TO BE CLEANED OR 86/JUNKED MAN TV-GUIDE NEED TO WATCH WERE THEY PUT THERE LOGO OVER THEY MIGHT HAVE SOMEONE IN THE PARKING LOT LOOKING FOR THERE MONEY BACK WITH SMILE ON THERE FACE BUT NOT THE KIND YOU WANT TO SEE ON SOMEONE UNLESS YOUR CRAZY ALSO AND WANT TO HANG OUT AND HIT THE PIPE WITH THEM AND BUG OUT TOGETHER !!!!!!
4,"As a fan of Bobby Darin, it was a treat to hear him perform in the old Las Vegas.  The way entertainment should be in any venue.  Because of the 100th Anniversary of Las Vegas, the album will become part of my collection celebrating this momentous event.  Don't miss this one of a kind CD"
2,"While it seems to be the tendency of many Cave fans to drool over anything the man records, this is not an album that is up to par with many of his other efforts.  There are some stand out tracks such as ""Deanna"" and ""Mercy"", but many of the rest come off as either overwrought or overly bombastic.  Obviously, if you're already a fan, you'll want this disc regardless, but to anyone new to Nick Cave's work I recommend his ""Best of"" collection or ""The Boatman's Call"""
4,"I've been listening to Soul Coughing religiously for years now and was thrilled when this disc was released (even though I knew I'd have almost all the material on it). Although all the songs here are well worthy of being here, I feel there are some songs missing that need to be here. Where are ""Fully Retractable"" and ""I Miss the Girl"", two of the funkiest Soul Coughing tracks? I am very pleased, however, that ""Unmarked Hellicopters"" was put on here despite not being on a precious Soul Coughing release. All in all this is a great disc, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good overwiew of soul coughing's music. However, I'm sure other die hard soul coughing fans will agree that there are some great tunes missing from this disc"
5,"Despite the very obvious issues with overdubbing, this is a GREAT release form the sisters. An album after being absent for 14 years?! What more can any Clark fan expect. I'm surprised to see contributions from Karen and Dorinda in terms of writing. Since Twinkie has been writing the music for 30 years, I figured that the case would be the same. What a nice surprise. Karen and Dorinda are both great song writers."
4,"OK so everyone has different tastes but to my mind some of Glenn`s best work did not make the cut on this album.  Instead we`ve been given work which has`nt appeared in any of Glenn`s previous releases, Common Ground, Who`s been sleepin in my bed etc, which while good pale beside I Volunteer, That Girl, Some Kind of Blue which all sound like they could have been Eagles tunes.  Having said that it is a good album although I would recommend Soul Searchin, Strange Weather ahead of this one.  Further proof that the Eagles whole is better than its part"
2,"Personally, I like the other albums from Staind. I love ""Dysfunction"", I like ""Break the Cycle"", ""14 Shades..."" was tolerable, and I really enjoyed ""Chapter V"". However, even for a debut, ""Tormented"" just sounds inmmature. There's emotion, but I lost count on the how many times the ""f-word"" is not only mentioned on the album, but on each song alone. Then again, Fred Durst produced this band in the first place, so that probably had a lot to do with it. All in all, the album itself just flat out sucks"
1,"George picked the worst way to show his voice.Songs are so boring and he doesn't stay in the right key! Save your money and buy Bo Bice's new AWESOME, AMAZING, album called The Real Thing! Bo will show you how it's done! Bo's the REAL DEAL folks! Bo blows all the other Idols who ever went on the show out of the water, makes them look real bad, yuck for Georgie!"
5,Great music... I have listened to a vast amount of  New Orlean's numbers and find this music very entertaining
5,"Finally some good old fashion HEAVY thrash metal from thrash giants The Haunted. I will say that every track is amazing, it's a non stop pulsating blast of thrash shoved down your thropat and bursting your ear drums. Yes it is that good. Now maybe I've over hyped it,  but I loved it that much. I haven't heard something this good since Carnal Forge! For fan of Carnal Forge, Slayer, and Lamb of God, you definately must check this band out! Good musicianship, fast paced, brutal, and heavy thrash is what can be found here. A must buy"
1,"Oh, stop whining ... they're pretty smart in one sense.  They knew they had a good thing with ""I Like to Move It.""  Do I like it?  No.  Do I understand it?  Sure.  There are plenty of schmoes who will impulse buy and pay the whole thing.   Me?  I plan on buying it later when the price goes down.  To e-bay we go! "
5,"XTC didn't start out with any remote idea of aspiring to the very stifling punk classicism of the day.The only relation  'White Music' has to punk is the simple three chord structures.  Otherwise tunes like the catchy &quot;This Is Pop&quot; and the offbeat,  quircky reggae of &quot;All Along The Watchtower&quot; have more relation to not only early British invasion music but to the more abstract musical experiments of American avante rockers.Neither is this in any way typical XTC-in years to come the band would  develope a sound much more melodic and sweet (neither of those  terms ever apply to this music) but the stuttering vocals and  Andy Partirdge's clever humor are more then enough to carry this album.From a guy whose more interested in funk and fusion normally I find this album worth a listen-'White Music' will  definately command your attention.And it's not too loud either"
5,"Alan Is One The Best Country Singers Today. When I First Heard &quot;She's Got The Rhythm (And I Got The Blues)&quot; I Began To Like It. He Can Sang Romantic Ballads Like: &quot;(Who Says) You Can't Have It All&quot; A Top  Ten Hit In Early 1994. The Songs I Like On This Album Are: &quot;Tonight I  Climbed The Wall&quot;, &quot;Mercury Blues&quot;, 1993's Big Number 1 Hit  &quot;Chattahoochee&quot;. You've Got To Buy This Album"
2,"NOT A LOT ELSE TO BE HONEST.  So many people have been fooled in to believing this band is amazing simply because of the speed that they play at, but to be honest is speed really everything?  All the songs on the CD lack creativity and sounds pretty much the same as the last song .  Every fu**ing track on this album is plagued with fast drum beats, some crappy power metal riff that remains throughout the song and lightning fast guitar solos which is impressive when you've heard one but by the end of the CD its a drag.  Don't get me wrong, to be able to play this takes a hell of a lot of skill and ability, but they need to use that skill and ability to come up with something a lot more creative and inventive"
1,One WEAK night!...zero stars if that was available. I never realized Bon Jovi was this bad a live band. They obviously get a LOT of production help in the studio because this album (several different concerts in several different venues) is ALL bad.  Sorry for them and sorry for me for buying it
4,"There seems little point to classifying this music. When standard tunes from the American Songbook and jazz idioms such as swing and bebop spark little to no recognition among the general public, music that could once be called ""experimental"" or ""avant garde"" necessarily defines the modern mainstream. If there are similarities with early landmark recordings (e.g. Miles Davis' 70s fusion groups),  ""Lawn Chair Society"" would definitely qualify as the less raw and extemporaneous, more polished and civil descendant of its once-controversial forebears.  Aside from electronics and musical synthesis, three qualities in particular stand out about this music: composition is emphasized above improvisation; creativity and craftsmanship count for more than interpretation and invention (both of which require a standard repertoire); tonal colors, dynamics and humor receive the kind of attention they enjoyed with Duke Ellington, before the ""bebop revolution.""  Lest any listeners require the ""jazz"" label to enjoy this music, Kenny Werner has called on the A Team for this multifarious collection of tone poems and programmatic pieces. The trumpet of Dave Douglas and bass clarinet of Chris Potter descend on ""Lo's Garden"" like a busy, darting pair of humming birds (joined at the hip, naturally). Soon a more vegetative pace is established by Scott Colley's firmly grounded bass while Brian Blade's percussion alternates between following movement at the sub-particle and quantum-field levels. Meanwhile, Werner's keyboards paint patterns in waves of sound, moving from prepared piano to phased Fender wahs, with a dab of string synth for highlighting.  ""Burble_burble_spleek"" is as onomatopoeic as the title--wind chimes, telephone rings and Douglas playing some of the most vocalized (and intestinal) trumpet sounds this side of Clark Terry and Rex Stewart. ""Uncovered Heart,"" a calming guitar-like ballad in E Major, is soon followed by the ambitious title number-- a collage of funked-up chatter, vocalized demagoguery by each horn player, some thoughtful discourse by Werner on piano, a ghostly dirge-like refrain intoned by unison horns, and finally the faint sounds of birds and hunters (certainly not a reference to a familiar White House-Halliburton figure?).  Closure comes not with a bang but with ""Loss,"" essentially a richly-textured chorale by synthesized strings, followed by ""Kothbiro,"" an extended peaceful incantation based on a simple African melody.  In conclusion, if ""Kind of Blue"" and Bill Evans' Vanguard Sessions are in your blood, this one is unlikely to replace either one.  All the same, it's well-conceived, smartly-executed, cutting-edge mixed-genre jazz"
2,"Eeyucch. Sounds like being stuck waiting for someone in the lobby of a Vegas hotel while the housekeeping staff is cleaning up in the background. Oh look, isn't that Wayne Newton over there"
2,"I like Slayer.  I really do.  This is one of the fastest, heaviest metal bands in existance, but I could never get in to their early albums, especially Hell Awaits.  I tend to prefer their later albums like Reign in Blood, because they were much better produced.  Rick Rubin made those records sound the way a speed metal record should, with everything up front in your face.  Reign in Blood had the most ""in your face"" sound of any record I've ever heard.  Hell Awaits on the other hand is just soaked in so much reverb that it sometimes reminds me of ""Pyromania"" by Def Leppard!  This is one of the heaviest bands in existance.  How is a speed metal band supposed to sound heavy when their producer insists on making them in to the speed metal version of Def Leppard?  Thrash is supposed to be ""in your face"".  There's no place for reverb on a speed metal record.  You want to hear heavilly reverbed production, than go buy a Def Leppard CD!  I myself prefer a more aggressive style that fits this kind of music.  Down with reverb!  I HATE reverb!  Layers of reverb have no place in speed metal"
2,"The selection of songs for this cd is excellent, however unable to leave well enough along they include overblown intros, restarts, embellishments etc making the original tune almost unrecognizable.  The arranger should be shot"
1,"Several songs on this album are note for note copied from Titus.  Has Tyler Bates no shame?  The original composer (Titus' Elliot Goldenthal) created an awesome score, buy it instead"
4,"Part of me wishes that Frank Black had condensed this 2 disc album into 1 really great album, but it's still, on the whole, a really great CD.  You'll fall in love with these songs"
1,"I love Balkan Beatbox and Matisyahu.. but ""so called seder"" was a so called... nightmare!  I was actually appalled I had purchased it without hearing many of the songs. I know it's acceptable to say certain things in rap/hip-hop.. but when it comes to our music.. please don't even go there!!  I was hoping for something more along the lines of Balkan Beatbox or Matisyahu, but sadly suprised at the lyrics I was hearing and sent it back to J-Dub with a letter why.. *sigh"
1,"I BOUGHT THIS CD FOR MY SON - WE ARE SEARCHING FOR GOOD R&amp;B / RAP WITH A POSITIVE MESSAGE - WE WERE VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS CD - THE RECORDING QUALITY WAS LACKING, THE BEATS VERY REPETITIVE AND UNINSPIRING, YOU COULD HARDLY HEAR THE WORDS - OVERALL - WE ARE LISTING THIS CD FOR SALE AND WE JUST BOUGHT IT YESTERDAY! MY HUSBAND, SON AND I ALL AGREED WITHIN TEN MINUTES THAT THIS CD WAS NOT A WINNER"
5,"Our family has enjoyed listening to this very much, we received it just in time for St. Patrick's Day"
5,"Spice delivers another classic for his fourth effort (and it's one of his top 3 albums). It has 15 songs, of which 4 are classics, 2 are near classics, 6 are good, 2 are ok, and 1 I skip. Guests are few and production is great. Produced by Blackjack (4 songs), Chase & Bosko (3 songs each), Ant Banks and Payback (2 songs each). It's a shame he didn't get no airplay over here on the east coast cause he'd have definitely gone multi-platinum as he deserves to do. Even though I'm used to Southern Cali rappers from MC Eiht to Ice Cube to CJ Mac, Spice did it with 1990-Sick to put the Bay on the map of gangsta rap.  The song 1990-Sick(Kill' Em All) featuring MC Eiht is a strong & heavy  Thug'sta song about haulicinations, Dirty Bay is a hard classic delivered by Dr.Bomb from da Bay, Sucka Ass Nigga featuring G-Nut is a hard Ice-T like hard hitter, and of course Spice has a horrorcore song called Snitch Killas that sounds like something of the Geto Boys or Ice Cube, this is Spice's #1 Album!  Freddy Chico's best are *1(featuring MC Eiht), *2, 3, 4(featuring Kokane), 5, 6, 7, *8(featuring G-Nut), 9, 10, 11, 12, *13, 14(featuring E-40) & 15."
4,"I bought this several years ago (before Amazon was around), and I love it. I loved the song ""Bangkok"" back when it got so much airplay in the 80's, and it was a pleasure to hear the rest of the musical. However, after spending $35 on the 2 disc set, one of the cd's cracked after a few plays. It wasn't my player, or anything like that - it just simply cracked. So one of these days I will replace it, and then I will be SURE to make a backup straight off just in case.   Also, I've never heard the Broadway version, but my husband has listened to both and says the original London cast version is far superior"
2,"Fat Joe's (A.K.A. Jose Antonio Cartagena) seventh solo album is ""Me, Myself and I"". Those familiar with his work may have noticed the album cover is similar to one of better releases his third album ""Don Cartagena"". The Bronx MC keep's this release short at twelve track's, and this album has three guest appearances which come from The Game, Lil Wayne and H-Mob. Production comes from Street Runner, LV, The Runner's DJ Khaled, Nu Jerzey Devil & Scott Scorch. The Runner's provide some of the best production on ""No Drama"" (Clap And Revolve) a grimy sounding cut. Lyrically Fat Joe is his usual braggy less then entertaining self for most of this album. His lyrics are as egotistical as his album titles. My problem with Fat Joe resides in the fact that he never puts any of his people on, instead following the same formula time after time. The Terror Squad is a crew full of talented MC's (even with the loss of Cuban Link and Triple Seis) and singer Tony Sunshine has a lot of potential - all of them get put on the back burner each year for a less then impressive Fat Joe album. Two of this album's closing track deserve some praise - Fat Joe's dedication to his Mom on ""Bendicion Mama"" and the follow up cut ""Story To Tell"" are decent. Buyer Beware, satisfaction not guaranteed"
5,"Excellent transaction, this CD was in perfect condition. I've spent hours of amazing fun listening to this amazing artist. thanks so much for such a great transaction"
5,"I have purchased both Awakened Mind System discs (original and 2.0) and both are amazing.  They have taken my meditations to a whole new level.  They are also great for power napping or doing creative work.  I feel that the Awakened Mind System discs are better than many of Thompson's other discs for two reasons.  First, AMS uses combinations of all brainwave frequencies (beta, alpha, theta, delta) which makes you feel both relaxed and energized, peaceful and creative, dreamy and focused, all at once.  This makes AMS useful for many different activities.  Second, they are outstanding for meditation because the music is purely ambient and abstract.  Many of Thompson's other discs, including the Theta Meditation System, use some ambience interspersed with repetitive melodies which can be quite distracting while meditating.  If you're looking for music to deepen your meditation, enhance your mental functioning, or even help you sleep, try the Awakened Mind System"
2,"Ok so i was reading the reveiw for this album and i heard a lot of people talkin trash, and a lot of people talkin candy canes and butterflys. So im here to set the record straight.   First of all, to all the folks who think this band is so great... Yes in the early years they had a good sound, and their songs ant bad, but they really sold out. You can walk into any mall right now and find sum 12 year old wearing a casualties shirt, or hat, or wallet, or patch, or toilet seat. They did the warped tour for gods sack. They obviously are worried more about money and fame then music. This has turned into teenybopper music, the same little @#!^'s that listen to blink 182 and sum 41 have this album. They go into a hot topic and buy it on cd with their mommys credit card, along with a 50 dollar pair of pants that look like sumone made in a clown college. This is not a great punk band, its punk for yuppies.  And to all the people that think its the worst band ever... I am so sick of hearing idiots that think they know everything about punk trashing the casualties saying they are fashion punks... Wether you wunna believe it or not punk has always had to do with clothes... Look at the new york dolls, alice cooper, richard hell, or the sex pistols. They all had a look, a image, and they started this whole thing. ""they said hey richard are you going to go out tonight, i said i am unsertent, I ant feeling to right. But i WRIPED UP MY SHIRT, watched the mirror and flirt, yeah im going to go out, out into sight."". And im sick of hearing about how they dont know how to play... NO punk bands know how to play, one of the reasons that punk is so great is that anyone can pick up a guitar or a drum set and start a group.   So in closing, your all idiots that know nothing about punk music, old or new. your opinions reflect your ignorance about the punk scene and non of you should ever call your selves punks."
4,"Of all of Tupac's post death material, this is probably my favourite album.  Though some may complain that the songs were not as Pac intended, I think they are a fitting tribute to him and for the most part, the updated production is great.  Most will already have heard the singles ""letter 2 My Unborn"" and ""Until The End Of Time"", both are great, and it is easy to see why they were chosen as singles.  Other notable tracks are ""This Aint Livin"" which is probably the best track on here, ""Breathin"", ""Everything They Owe"", ""Lastonesleft"", ""M.O.B"" and ""World Wide Mob Figgaz"".  In fact most of the tracks on here are at least good.  It goes without saying that this album is not as good as the material Pac produced while alive, after all these are his throw away songs.  Just goes to show what a genius Pac was, that these are songs he didn't consider good enough for his albums, they put most other rappers A tracks to shame.  I give it 4 stars because there are a few filler tracks and The Outlawz are just on here too much.  While I have a load of respect for The Outlawz for staying true to Pac, I just don't rate their rapping skills too highly.  Anyway an amazing album, especially considering Pac had been dead for 5 years when this was released.  R.I.P Tupac "
4,"&quot;Super Hits of the '70's - Have A Nice Day Vol. 21&quot; contains yet more of those '70's power-pop Top 40 tunes you've come to know and love. This collection focuses on the late '70's - specifically late 1977/early 1978. Ram Jam's &quot;Black Betty&quot; kicks things off into high gear, with an unmistakable Southern-rock, hard-edged flair. As the Autumn months of '77 rolled around, moviegoers hadn't quite gotten their fill of the box-office mega-flick &quot;Star Wars&quot;, which was released in theaters earlier that summer, so a discofied rendition of John Williams' original score was released - this version by Meco titled &quot;Star Wars Theme/Cantina Band&quot;, which hit the Billboard charts big-time and made it to number one, as well. The Los Angeles-based group Player reaped adequate rewards from their first single titled &quot;Baby Come Back&quot;, released during early '78. Player's success was short-lived however, and saw just two more singles enter the charts during the course of the year, and disbanded soon afterward. The absolute worst song of all time appears on this collection - Meri Wilson's &quot;Telephone Man&quot;. Whoever had the foresight to include this clutter here had to have been on battery acid, as it is just plain horrible and incredibly insipid - which is why &quot;Have A Nice Day Vol. 21 gets four stars instead of five. Now that we've gotten that senseless, moronic &quot;tune&quot; out of the way, let us continue onward. Ex-Spirit and Jo Jo Gunne member Jay Ferguson, who had a hit with the former group and sang lead on the single &quot;I've Got A Line On You&quot; in the late '60's, contributes here with his only solo chart effort &quot;Thunder Island&quot;, released in the Spring of '78. If it's wispy, sentimental ballads that you crave, there's Dan Hill's &quot;Sometimes When We Touch&quot;, a major hit in both the U.S. and Canada also during the Spring of '78. For a howlingly good time, ghouls, ghosts and goblins will have a frightfully good time with Warren Zevon's &quot;Werewolves Of London&quot;. Moviegoers in the Winter of '77/'78 will recognize ex-Bread frontman David Gates' &quot;Goodbye Girl&quot; from the movie of the same name, which was released in April of '78 after the motion picture's release. Wales's Bonnie Tyler had her first big hit with &quot;It's A Heartache&quot; during the Summer of '78, as well as did Michael Johnson with his hit - the melancholic tear jerker &quot;Bluer Than Blue&quot;. Before Exile jumped the pop ship into country music waters, they hit it big with &quot;Kiss You All Over&quot;, written by two of the group's members - Mike Chapman and Nicky Chinn, who became songwriters and mega-producers for other artists during the late '70's and early '80's. Finally, to round out this collection of chartbusters, there's Walter Egan's top twenty smash &quot;Magnet And Steel&quot;, which also features backing vocals courtesy of Fleetwood Mac's Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. As far as &quot;Telephone Man&quot; is concerned, I felt Rhino could have utilized better singles for this collection from that era in its place, such as Dolly Parton's &quot;Here You Come Again&quot;, or Firefall's &quot;Just Remember I Love You&quot; (both released in Autumn of '77), to name a few, although there are several other singles from this time period that could have definitely gotten the nod over &quot;Telephone Man&quot;. Even though we're stuck with TM, &quot;Have A Nice Day Vol. 21&quot; is still a good arrangement of superbly crafted pop tunes to have in your CD collection at any rate. A must have for completeists of this 25 volume series"
5,"If you mix up the awesome Primitives from the 80s, with the Spector wall of sound , in a Swedish garage with some power pop licks you might get something like The Legends. That being said they are not rigidly classifiable. Just great music.  This was one CD I was glad I got and have played it the most in the last couple of months."
2,"I can't believe how watered down and lifeless this album sounds! SOUL ASYLUM released an absolute winner with ""Hang Time"", a perfect blend of pop, punk and metal. With ""And the Horse They Rode in On"", I am truly baffled as to what happened. First off, even if you actually like the music here in, the cover is GOD AWFUL!!! And that title! What was going on Dave Pirner's mind?!?! Now, before you lovers of this album hang me, this release has its moments. ""Spinning"" starts off great and it's a great follow up song to the ""Hang Time"" album. But from there, the songs are a mixture of hit and miss with no real stand out tracks. And the production makes SOUL ASYLUM sound as bland as your favorite JELL-O flavor. For an ex-hardcore band this is really a low point. The songs sound as if something's about to happen, but in the end we are left wondering what happened. The irony of it all is that SOUL ASYLUM's so called ""sell out"" album (you know what album!)has more balls than this release!!! Sad but true, but what's even sadder is that Dave Pirner is actually a good songwriter and I'll have to wonder what made his mind so dry as to put this mediocre album out"
4,this album covers all of maries long career and every track down memory lane is a gem a must for osmond fans.if you are not a fan you will be after listening to the best of marie osmond
2,This CD Sucks. I mean Bruce Springstein is such a has been. Dude retire please!  U2 also another has been group. I think someone needs to revamp the Grammy nominations and choose some really great music. Ya know songs that will last forever and never grow old!!
5,"Iron Maiden's seventh studio album fittingly called Seventh Son of a Seventh Son was released in April of 1988. The album was the band;s first new studio album in nearly two years and would be their last with guitarist Adrian Smith until his return on 2000's Brave New World(not coincidentally it was also their last masterpiece for twelve years as well). Smith plus lead singer Bruce Dickinson, bass player Steve Harris, guitarist Dave Murray and drummer Nicko McBrain made certain that Adrian's last album with Maiden for over a decade was also arguably the band's best album as I found out when I got the Capitol Record cassette version in May of 1988 and later the remastered CD. Seventh Son of a Seventh Son was Maiden's first concept album about a cursed child who is born with special powers and it tempted by the side of both good and evil. Also, the band was starting to become more progressive sounding as their music was reminiscent to that of ELP, Genesis, Pink Floyd and so forth with the tempo changes and lyric-wise. We begin the album with Moonchild which begins as an acoustic passage giving this album's theme and then it builds into a superb rocker penned by Smith and Dickinson. Next is the superb Infinite Dreams penned by Harris and was a great progressive rocker alternating between quiet and heavy and light and dark sections. Next was the album's biggest hit Can I Play With Madness penned by Smith/Harris/Dickinson which sounded reminiscent to the previous album, 1986's Somewhere in Time's biggest hit, Wasted Years. Next is The Evil That Men Do also penned by Harris/Smith/Dickinson and is another stellar rocker. This song was always one of my favorites. The album's second half begins with the epic length title cut! Like the 13 plus minute Rime Of The Ancient Mariner and 9 minute Alexander The Great before it, it is the longest and best track on the album. Unlike those two aforementioned epics, the Harris penned title cut was the band's first 10 minute track which they created the story themselves. Wonderful musicianship throughout, especially Murray and Smith's guitar duels at the end which is an awesome piece of music. The Prophecy is next and is a great track penned by Murray/Harris and ends with a superb acoustic guitar section. next is the album's third single The Clairvoyant which is another great rocker. We end the album with arguably one of Maiden's best album closers Only The Good Die Young. This Harris/Dickinson penned piece is a killer rocker. Then when you think the album ended after the big finish, the album ends with a reprise of the acoustic passage that started Moonchild.  Seventh Son of a Seventh Son was another Top 20 charting US million seller and it was because the material was strong, the production was killer and because it was Iron Maiden! RECOMMENDED"
2,"Well, I gave this CD its first spin after a two year absence of ANY Ricky Martin music in my life. After his 1999 self-title CD, I pretty much went head over heals for Ricky. When this CD came out in November of 2000 I was really excited. Upon first listening to it, I thought it was better than his 99 CD but no where near as good as Vuelve. It would take 2003's Almas Del Silencio to really wash way the bad taste in my mouth that this CD leaves.   As several folks know, Ricky was under pressure from his managers, producers and the record company to deliver a follow up to his 1999 CD. Sound Loaded is what we got. This album was obviously rushed and it sounds like it. Weak lyrics and over saturation of musical gimicks is utilzed to keep the 'Livin La Vida Loca' fever burning. Ricky's voice just sounds tired and worn out. It's easy to tell that he was way over due for a vacation.   There are a few standout tracks on the disc. 'Amor' by far out shines every song by a mile. Had Sound Loaded had more great tunes like 'Amor' on it, the CD would have been a hit. As it is, the CD is mediocre at best."
1,"This is authentic, classic, timeless poo. hot and fresh from the gut!!!"
5,"This is a hard swinging Blue Note session from the late 50's. It features a classic line up of Clark on piano, John Coltrane on tenor, Curtis Fuller on trombone, Donald Byrd on trumpet, Paul Chambers on bass, and Art Taylor  on drums. All of the artists are comfortable in the session and no one  musician dominates the set. The selections are arranged as to give everyone  room to stretch and explore the collection of standards and Clark  originals. Sonny's light, nimble touch is on display throughout the  session. His solos are well worth listening to several times and swing on  each track. Curtis Fuller has a warm, tender solo on the standard Come Rain  Or Come Shine, and Coltrane shines on Speak Low. Everyone gets room to blow  on the uptempo opening track, With a Song in My Heart, with Byrd's bright  brassy trumpet leading the way. Finally, Clark's compositional skills shine  thru on the classic that closes the set, News For Lulu. This is another  great Blue Note &quot;Connoisseur&quot; reissue of a &quot;lost  classic&quot;, it gets one star automatically for putting all of the  alternates at the end of the album instead of stringing them behind the  master takes. I recommend this set as a classic straight ahead swinging  hard bop date, especially to fans of the &quot;Blue Note sound&quot"
5,"This containes some of Greg Brown's finest writing, it is however different from his most of his other recordings. This is a dark look at American culture without being melodramatic. I purchased this one after adding one of his finest efforts &quot;The Poet Game&quot; to my collection, and I find lyrically to be amongst his best work. Highlights include 3 unique tracks &quot;The Monkey&quot;, &quot;One Cool Remove&quot;, and &quot;America Will Eat You&quot;. Other Greg Brown albums that I purchased after this one (quite a few) although they were great, did not quite rate as high on my list"
5,I am very pleased with this CD and I received it quickly. Recommend this seller highly.
5,My favourite group of music makers ever.. The album did not dissappoint.. thank you Amazo
5,"I have seen many anime's and this one has a really good soundtrack for the Hack Liminality anime's.  This is for there ps2 game series.  Even though the game+anime isn't available in the us this is a soundtrack to buy.  Comes with some techno, and great choir soundtracks in latin I thin"
1,"I purchased this after reading the reviews, I was surprised when I received it.  Hated it, I found it quite disturbing to listen to"
5,"It seems that many want to place Kim Richey in a box and she just doesn't seem to fit in one.  Like Shawn Colvin, she is someone who just has her own category.  This is actually my favorite of all the Kim Richey I own, followed by ""Bitter Sweet"" and ""Rise"".  My favorite song on ""Glimmer"" is ""Didn't I"" and the title song is great as well.  Give this one a try and enjoy."
5,"I got this yesterday for Christmas after hearing the song, "" You Set Me Free"" used on the Ice Princess Soundtrack, and i love it! Well, most of it. Here's my review of The Spirit Room.  1. Everywhere- 9/10- A fun and upbeat song. Pretty good, love the intro to it.   2. You Get Me- 5/10- It's pretty, but just too slow to me. Maybe it'll grow on me eventually.   3. All You Wanted- 10/10- The BEST on the album. Love it! Was this a single? If not, it definalty should have been.   4. You Set Me Free- 10/10- Like i already wrote, I got this CD after hearing this song on Ice Princess. Really good and fun to sing to.   5. Something to Sleep To- 7/10- OK. You should listen to it if you want to go to sleep. I still think it's OK.  6. Here With Me- 9/10- Love the beginning and the chorus. It seems like a really good song for a party.  7. Sweet Misery- 6/10- OK also. I just don't really like how the chorus is and it's too short.  8. If Only She Knew- 10/10- Fun and cool. One of my favorites.   9. I'd Rather Be in Love- 7/10- Sounds alot like Sweet Misery.  10. Goodbye to You- 8/10- This is a really pretty song about moving on in life.  11. Drop in the OCean- I don't really get this song. I'm not going to rate it.  Overall, this CD gets an A. It's pretty good. I think you should buy it"
4,Awesome! A classic Faith No More Album. It will blow you away. Supreme war  pigs cover showing just how heavy FNM can be. Even sports a little comic  relief by doing a New kids on the block tun
2,"Once again Ultra records has put it's trust into New York DJ's, and the results are not pleasing.  Disc one mixed by Vic Latino from NYC is good enough for radio (stick to KTU) but not for the higher standards set by the UK DJ's who are always well ahead of the game. Bad song choices and even worse mix choices make Disc 1 a failure.   Disc 2 mixed by The Riddler, also a NYC DJ is a vast improvment and he should be commended on his effort and this just proves not all DJ's from NYC are all bad. Better song choices here more on the Trance side but with enough vocal power to keep you moving. This Disc will be the one you play the most.  But for the money it's still a deal. I've liked Ultra's Trance CD's alot better, but if your looking for real club music stay with a proven winner and check out Ministry Of Sound, you can't go wrong with any of their CD'"
1,"I was excited when I heard about this.  Sorry, I can't handle it.  Bare, buddy, you should stay in retirement if this is going to be the result of your new efforts"
1,"Proof a hot chick with a decent voice can destroy a synth-pop hit from a better era of music. Though it's really the sound of the music that is lacking in Gwen's version, so I can't blame her for the disaster.  The original still rules"
1,"This is a horrible CD!  It was like nails on a chalkboard listening to it then I finally had enough and took it out of my player and threw it away.  There may have been 3 songs on this CD that were actually OK, but the rest of it were these obscure songs that came from under a rock somewhere. "
5,"2day i just ordered this cd from barns and noble! cant wait til it comes in! i love the songs surrender and all night long! i also recomend the fallowing cds and artists,everytime we touch by cascada,a fever you cant sweat out by panic! at the disco,1on 1 by rupee,decemberunderground by afi,greatest hits by ace of base,flyleaf by flyleaf,sound advice by shapeshifters,and end of gray by decyfer down! buy them all"
2,"Most of these songs are classic, but the disc is too short for it's own good. Clocking in at 35:48 with only 12 songs. Ouch! Well, I guess you can look at it like an old 33 1/3 rpm. Just hit the pause button after track 6. Take a deep breath or go to the bathroom or fix a drink. Then hit the play button.  But seriously, there are so many countless trinkets missing from a collection called, ""20th Century Masters: The Best of the Andrews Sisters, The Millennium Collection,"" wow, that's a bit long winded. But, with a title like that you ought to have Rhumboogie, Beer Barrel Polka, Well Alright, Straighten Up And Fly Right, Rumors Are Flying, etc. Don't get me wrong, it's a nice introduction but just too short.   Buyer beware!  Finally, why can't these compilations of old 78's have a few more seconds between them? Essentially we have a bunch of singles all crammed together, so why not let them have some breathing room. As I recall, the UK Beatles albums from 1963-1966 had a seven second break between songs. I loved it! It was like giving each song it's own spotlight. Oh, the days of one song at a time."
1,"YO THIS JOINT IS WACK. ITS A WASTE OF TIME I DON'T WHY I BROUGHT IT. YOUR BEST BET IS TO WAIT FOR LIL WEEZEE TO DROP HIS NEXT ALBUM. HE IS CASH MONEY NOW. SINCE JUVE HAS LEFT MAYBE THE REST OF THE HOT BOYS SHOULD CONSIDER IT TOO MICKEY AND LAC ARE JUST PLAIN WACK. MANNIE FRESH HAS BEEN SURPASSED BY THE LIKES OF TIMBERLAND, NEPTUNES,TRACK MASTERS HIS BEATS JUST CAN'T COMPETE ANYMORE. CASH MONEY SHOULD LOOK INTO LETTING SOMEONE ELSE DO THEIR TRACKS INSTEAD OF MANNIE DOING THE WHOLE ALBUM BECAUSE HE HAS LOST HIS TOUCH"
5,"I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE I WAS TRYING EXPAND MY HORIZONS, YOU KNOW? CULTURALLY AND MENTALLY, YOU KNOW? SERIOUSLY THOUGH I WAS IN THE SHOP AND I WAS HAVING A GAZE AROUND THE PLACE AND THEN THIS PICTURE JUST JUMPS OUT AT ME, AND I PICKED IT UP AND IT WAS THIS DEBUSSY CHAP AND ID HEARD ABOUT HIM ON THE BBC LEARNING ZONE SO I THOUGHT ;why not?; SERIOUSLY THOUGH I DRAGGED IT HOME AND I POPPED IT IN THE OLD CD PLAYER AND IT FLOORED ME.......I MEAN SERIOUSLY THIS THING...AMAAZING STUFF..I MEAN TODAYS MUSIC HAS NOTHING, NOTHING NOTHING ON THIS STUFF RIGHT HERE.   SOME GOOD TRACKS ARE: TRACK 1 IS THE BEST. THE OPENING FLUTE ON THE TRACK IS TOTALLY CHILLED AND COOL, REMINDS ME A BIT OF TRACK 13 ON ILL COMMUNICATION BY THE BEASTIE BOYS...A COINCIDENCE???  THE ONLY WEAK TRACK ON THE ALBUM IS TRACK 6, THE UNFORTUNATELY TITLED ""CHILDRENS CORNER SUITE: GOLLIWOGGS CAKE WALK"" THE MUSIC IS JUST DATED MAN, JUST AS DATED AS THE TITLE.  OVERALL THOUGH THIS IS A QUALITY ALBUM, WITH CHILLS, SPILLS AND THRILLS. SERIOUSLY THOUGH A FINE EFFORT"
4,"This 1973 follow up to the Wailers debut `Catch A Fire' is mainly a collection of updated singles that had been doing the rounds on the Jamaican underground scene for years. `Get Up, Stand Up' and `I Shot The Sheriff' are two of the most hitting cuts the Wailers ever recorded, but the rest of the material doesn't have the same mass appeal of their other albums. This is more an album for hardcore fans of reggae than the general audience. It's a cool set but `Burnin' isn't an album I can bump too much"
4,"This CD contains both studio re-recordings of earlier works (""Judas"", ""Dandelion"", ""Anna"", etc.) as well as new songs.  I have some sympathy for Ben Fassett's earlier comment.  Those who have heard Antje Duvekot's earlier works (""Little Peppermints"" and ""Boys, Flowers, Miles"") may be surprised by her sound in this CD.   I was fortunate enough to hear her live in concert the other night, and was completely impressed by her presence and performance.  Her earlier CDs convey the power of her solo performance; think Patty Griffin's ""Living with Ghosts"" as a comparable example.  Paradoxically, less is more.    This CD, on the other hand, adds string arrangements and other instruments to her voice and guitar.  I think that some of the raw emotion and poignancy can get lost in the production, and her voice can occasionally be muted.  In her concert, she performed some of the new songs from this CD, and they were very much in the style of her earlier CDs.  The earlier CDs also reveal her live demeanor which is quite shy, humorous and self-deprecating.  You should really try to see her in person if you have a chance.  On the other hand, this CD represents more Antje Duvekot, and that is never a bad thing.  It is still well worth the purchase, but consider also ""Boys, Flowers, Miles"" to hear the power of her solo voice"
5,I've already listened to samples of her new CD.Its even better than her first one!!! More rock in it! anyways this is an amazing debut album.I love it the way to begin and anticonformity are the best songs on the CD
4,"I'm reviewing this to raise the avg. star rating.  I think this is a decent piece of work that is not intended to be listened to in one sitting.  The songs are kinda slow grooves that remind me a lot of Traffic at times; funk keyboards wash over the whole thing and the vocals are almost inaudible whispers.  I'm not sure what place this kind of music holds in the industry, in society, among fellow musicians.  I only know that it doesn't deserve a three star avg, though it all kind feels like one big song, it's a real cool, groovy song"
5,"I don't understand what the previous &quot;reviewer&quot; was talking about, that miles was playing it square here. This is a beautiful, relaxed album, and one of the only quartet recordings miles did. Plus, he plays the  open trumpet on every tune. He made this album when he was waking up from  his blue haze of heroin addiction, right before he went on to huge fame and  success and you can hear all his new ideas formulating on this record.  However, if you're only accustomed to later Miles Davis records where he  was fueled by fiery tenormen like Shorter and Coltrane, then maybe it might  sound too laid back for you. I dunno"
2,"In many ways a relic of its era, ""Not of This Earth"" is the first widely distributed release by Joe Satriani (a previous EP ended up being reissued as part of ""Time Machine"", years later).  The guitarist, supported by drummer Jeff Campitelli and percussionist John Cuniberti came into public attention when Steve Vai, a former student of Satriani, ended up singing his teacher's praises in the music press.  The result is that this album, more than likely to have been lost in the shuffle of instrumental rock music, received wider recognition and poised Satriani to explode into a bonafide celebrity on his next record.  The album itself is a bit uneven-- Satriani is a flawlessly brilliant guitarist, but as a songwriter, he wasn't quite ready.  Several pieces (""Not of This Earth"", ""Hordes of Locusts"") seem to run out of steam before they end, and a couple (""The Snake"", ""Driving At Night"") feel like bad '80s metal.  On the other hand, several pieces shine-- delicate and lovely ""Rubina"", reggaeish and emotionally soaked ""Memories"", and the overtly Frippesque ""New Day"" are all fine examples of what Satriani is capable of.  But my favorite is probably ""Brother John"", where Satriani abandons all his effects and performs his delicate and bubbly melody cleantone.  In the end, the album is ok, but Satriani would go on to do so much more interesting in the future.  Come back to this one if you've picked up a bunch of other stuff and are looking for more, but most should start with ""Surfing With the Alien"""
1,"so i really liked new nathan detroits...i kept listening, hoping for more.  what i got was a listless drone of alternative sounding chords and alkaline trio style vocals.  i suppose i didnt give the album much of a chance... but when i have to stop listening to it twice because it bores me so much, i dont feel like i need to.  the album appeared to have potential...but nothing stuck out except for the first track.  everything just ran together, and it was difficult to seperate any sort of melody in any of the songs.  compared to all the other reviews, i am apparently missing something, but i didnt like it.  i heard it directly after listening to appleseed casts' &quot;end of the ring wars&quot;, which was amazing.  so i guess would recomend that over this anyday.  i will give this album another chance, simply because everyone else seems to like it so much, but as for right now, it gets a big juicy thumbs down"
5,Normaly this isn't my type of music but he is so great at it I had to buy i
5,"I have good instincts, folks.  Just like all of you who've already givin' this a glowing review.  I checked this out from the library a few days ago and was immediately FLOORED.  So much so that I'm thinking about not reteurning it; telling them I lost it an' just paying for it.  I'm amazed at the gracefulness that comes across when you put together two so distinct an' so DIFFERENT voices.  Louis' scratchy, gruff, yet likeable an' melodic croon an' Ella's smooth-as-silk, soothing an' intoxicating voice incredibly, to me, go PERFECTLY on these duets here.  From that first opener 'Let's Call the Whole Thing off', done so sly an' flirtatious on both parts, to 'Gee, Baby, Ain't I Good to You' to the ever-engaging 'Autumn in New York' and 'Stars Fell on Alabama' one of the GREATEST standards EVER written (""And in the center just you and me, My heart beat like a hammer, My arms wound around you tight, And stars fell on Alabama last night"").  THAT is what romance is, kiddies!  Oh, an' I can't forget 'Summertime'.  Ahhh, yes, 'Summertime', with that opening trumpet that tugs at your heart strings and makes you wish for days of love, happiness, sunlights an' flowers; a world of beauty that should never be taken for granted.  Yeah, I know what you're thinkin'; ""there he goes, layin' it on thick again.""  Well, I can't help it.  In a time filled with the most repugnant excuses for music I've ever heard in all my soon-to-be twenty-five years, it is a shining gift that this music has been preserved for us who TRULY appreciate talent and genius.  There's no show-boating here, no bone-headed braggadocio, no studio gimmicks.  THIS is what music is. "
2,"If you're a fan of either ""Holiday Inn"" or ""White Christmas"" you really, really should avoid this one.  Its recording quality not only offers substandard ""tin can"" sound, but you won't find Rosemary Clooney on a single track from White Christmas.    This is not a soundtrack.  It's a studio version of songs that sound familiar from the movies but were not performed this way on screen.  Disappointing to say the least, as me and mine are avid fans of these Christmas-themed films.  The two stars I've placed here are generous, but I couldn't move down to one ... ""hate"" doesn't fit.  I am, however, not keeping this CD.  Too depressing and not at all what I hoped to hear.  If you're a true fan of the films, these recordings won't be what you hope to hear, either.  Good luck in finding the real thing! "
4,"This band is a great pick-up, especially if you like bands like Shinedown or Tantric.  At times, I wish there was more guitar parts on the album, but its a very solid, safe, and well produced release.  nothing ground breaking, but a great listen that will be in my changer for weeks to come"
5,"This is in my opinion the best performace from Anders. He mixes his higher pitched vocals found prominatly on the newer albums with the classic Melo Death vocals found on earlier albums. There is also some low talking thrown in a few songs, Bullet Ride being one of them. Musically, while its not their best, it is very good. Similar to the vocals they mix old and new sound on this CD to create a masterpiece. Pounding and yet melodic guitar work is the In Flames trademark. Also, Daniel's drumming on this album is probably his finest hour, a standout for him being Brush the Dust Away.  Stand out tracks overall are:  Bullet Ride Pinball Map Square Nothing Brush the Dust Away  All the songs on here are awesome those are just my favorites. This is a good CD for newcomers because it isnt too much like the old or new and its a great mix.  All in all, this is not only one of my favorite CDs from In Flames, but all time as well"
1,"I am a huge Mars fan, but this is just bore.  I was really looking forward to a cd representive of their live shows, but this is a horrible excuse for a live album from anyone especially from Mars Volta. I am all for experimentation, but if you look at the liner notes there are a ton of non-band members jerkin' off on this after the original recording and personally coming from a recording and engineering backround it is not creative or good.  It seems like a bad painting. Save your money and buy bootleg of their actual live show."
5,Who knows how different the history of music as we know it would be like without this genius.  Every blues musician since and many classic rock bands owe him a huge debt.  This is a must for any music collection
5,"This is a finely crafted album, it's just beautiful. Background harmonies from Dolly Parton, Emmylou Harris, Ricky Skaggs, Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Trisha Yearwood.... Patty is fantastic on her own, but with these voices blended in, something special was created."
5,"Some artists are good enough that to label one work as their best says more than a lot.  Nick Cave is by all means one of them.  And 'Your Funeral...My Trial' is that golden release.  Beginning with the slow title cut, it moves it's way through track after track, sometimes menacing, sometimes violent, sometimes beautiful, and always thought provoking and dark.  Highlights?  Honestly, all of them.  Warning, this album is Nick's least accesable and that says a lot too.  But after a few good listens, it works it's way into your brain and it's the best thing since ever- I promise"
5,"This 16-song compilation of western swing includes: San Antonio Rose, Lilly Dale, Texas Two Step, and Big Ball in Cowtown.  http://www.cowgirls.com EN"
2,By far nothing comparable to Javier Solis. Not taking anything away from the tenor of OPERA not Ranchera...Lets leave the rancheras for those who are gifted in its style.  You want real rancheras listen to MR. Javier Solis
2,"A giant leap back from Love.Angel.Music.Baby. What was she thinking with this album? This music does not compare at all to L.A.M.B. and her No Doubt days. 'The Sweet Escape' (song) is very successful on the charts, ...and I honestly don't understand why. It's so generic and 'woo hoo' part is so annoying. The album is a one star but I'll give her two because I still love Gwen"
5,"This is the last really good album that Lou Reed made in 1990. He captures the feel of his New York and you can visualise what the Dirty Boulevard looks like. Lou is at his best when he plays tough and on New York his hard edged urban lyrics really hit the spot. For Velvet's fans, im going to rate this 3rd of Lou's solo efforts behind Transformer and Take No Prisoners"
1,"Now usually if I know 100% that something is wack, I won't waste my money on it and can just download it for free. Now I wish that I didn't even do that at all. A lot of reviewers seem to have faced the facts: Paris CANNOT SING! This here has proven that clearly. Now that I think about it, what can she do?...other than being a rich [female] who keep her name in the news (That ""E!"" channel if anyone actually watches that) on something stupid. Now on to this. There is no other explaimation to it except that it sucks. The original song sucks, and the four remixes are even worse, not to mention that some of them are pretty long in length. But lets face the facts; despite many 1 or 2 star reviews, bull [...] music is going to sell. True, if the rap group Dead 4 Life can have a high selling single ""Laffy Taffy"" and have their album go gold, there is no telling for what numbers Paris Hilton will put up, just because it's her. Easily one of the worst songs I've heard in the past 5 years.   Take my advice: There is halfassed talent out there that is better than this. Also $18 is too much to have something to sit your drinks on. And if this is imported, it should have been confiscated when trying to get through U.S. customs. It's THAT bad!  When songs like this see the light of day, you know that shes doing whatever she can to stay relevant.  Lyrics: F Production: D- Musical Vibes: "
1,"This band has potential but has zero groove, nothing to latch onto at all. Go see the Sword and leave early, man"
5,"Great price, fast delivery, CD in excellent condition!  What more could you ask for??!"
5,"Michael Hoppe is a treasure. From his earliest recordings until his latest, Requiem, I have never been disappointed. Solace does not have one track that you will skip over. The soloists, where there are vocals, are superb and speak straight to the heart. Occasionally we are given a musical gift that lasts us a lifetime. This is one of those gifts. Therese Tappouni  Writer, Workshop Director, author of A Time to Reap and Walking Your Walk, a Woman's Guide to a Spirit Filled Life"
2,"Save your money unless YOU TRULY ARE A FAN OF CHICAGO! The only tracks I listen to are HARD HABIT TO BREAK and IF YOU'RE LEAVING NOW. The other tracks really didn't do anything for me. I would say that a more complete volume of ""best of"" would probably be a better choice"
1,"Yeah, man. I used to be like really stupid. I got bad grades in school. But then I started listening to Modest Mouse's music and I was like, ""whoa!"" and now I'm really smart, and no one is smarter than me in my whole school, including the teachers! They should market ""Lonesome Crowded West"" on TV as a way to get kids to do better in school, because it makes you intelligent. It's a scientific fact! All you people who give this album a negative review whould go and listen again, because some times you have to listen more than once. And if you still don't get it after like 30 listens, then listen 30 more, because listening that much to a rock and roll band is in no way pathetic. Besides, being a Modest Mouse fan makes you a card carrying member of the special club, where you get to talk about Modest Mouse and the sophistication and about how Isaac Brock's childhood was so tragic and nothing like that has ever happened to anyone else and how now he's my god and astrology and Modest Mouse chatrooms and Modest Mouse T-Shirts and Modest Mouse CDs and books off the Modest Mouse website and how horrible capitalism is. Don't you wanna be a member of the club?   This CD has changed my life completely. I used to have no friends and I spent a lot of time in my parent's basement. And now.... well, I still don't have friends and I live in my parent's basement, but the people online understand that I ""get"" how Modest Mouse's music is an excellent replacement for the voids in my life that otherwise would have been filled with girlfriends and thinking (yuch!!!!!!!!!!!). And that one song where Isaac says, ""My thoughts weren't so loud"" is like, so true, because we live in a democracy which just let's the man hold Isaac back. What we need to do is set up socialism, with Isaac at the top and he'll provide for the rest of us and we never have to get jobs because he's so talented. He's like, outgrown his fans, too. Except me. Like, some days, I listen to ""This is a Long Drive for Someone With Nothing to Think About"" which is an awesome title because it's so long it's like a sentence and I'm so cool and smart because I get that. Well, I didn't really get that on my own, but I was the one who pushed the buttons while I was on the internet, in between visits to the Modest Mouse messageboard of course. But some days, I listen to the album and cry out in wonder at the height of my sophistication for listening and enjoying such a unique group, and I feel so accomplished and brilliant and that isn't a waste of a day at all. And then I go onto another album, like ""The Moon and Antarctica"" (I didn't even know you could seen the moon from down there!!!!!!!) and I link all the geographcial and astronomical references and I learn a lot that week. And then I listen to that bootleg I got and then the DVD I got off ebay from another guy who ""gets Modest Mouse"" and suddenly I've spent a year putting all these things together from the lyrics and I'm like ""Whoa, I thought I was smart before, but now I'm REALLY smart,"" you know, because I've spent so much time listening to Modest Mouse and talking about Modest Mouse on the internet, and suddenly it's been, like five years, which is perfect because that's how often my gods put out an album. It's odd I haven't realized yet that I've completely dedicated myself to a ROCK BAND and all my money, opportunity, and life have been paid over to Modest Mouse. It's just a good thing that I think for myself and that I'm so different from all the other Modest Mouse fans that do the exact same thing I do. Yep, good thing.   j5w2k9@hotmail.com"
1,"This Was Joe Walsh in his Prime, when he was really Rockin' If your A james Gang fan, and you like live music, you really should own this ""CD""!  (Joe at some of his best!!!)"
1,Thousand Foot Krutch suck in my opinion.  I bought this CD hoping to find a good band but I found a band I really do not like.  It is just not the type of music I like to listen too.  But it is not good to always base your opinion on people who may not like the same music as you so you should try it out and give it a try i really just dont like it
4,"For those who need their music to be deep and thought provoking, then maybe this album isn't for you. For those who just want good melodic pop songs that crawl inside your head, then this is definitely for you. I play it from beginning to end without skipping a song. Also contains Deperate Fools which ranks among my all-time Carmen favorites. Unlike most other solo material, there is a hint of disco in a few of the songs. In my opinion, 8 of these songs are B+ with the final cut an A+"
2,"I grew enamored with Eric Carmen's music, drawn in by not only the many honest, complicated emotions of his first two solo albums (especially Boats Against The Current) but also by the occasionally hard-hitting pop of The Raspberries.  I got away from Carmen's work for a long time, but recently have been relistening to the old LP's and gave Change of Heart a spin.  After hearing it again, I was surprised at three things.  First, most songs seemed half-baked, with the chorus on most making a quick appearance and then repeating endlessly.  These are short songs, devoid of development and any compositional reach.  Second, the production seemed both overdone and timid at the same time.  Overdone in the all-star backing musicians (Danny Kortchmar! Leland Sklar!  Nigel Olsson!  Burton Cummings!  Jeff Porcaro!) playing very simple stuff.  Overdone in the too-thick orchestration.  Timid like the hand claps and piano glissandos on ""Hey Deanie"" and other examples throughout the album.  Finally, I was surprised by the brevity.  Only 8 tunes, with a syrupy orchestral variation on the title track.  Again, underlining the overall theme of an uninspired, tired work"
2,"I thought the album was boring.  I didn't watch Nashville Star but I'm a big country music fan and I like to listen to new artists.  I bought the cd and loved the catchy song ""I Break Things"".  The other songs really didn't grab me, even after several listens.  I was disappointed in her cover of ""I'm Not Lisa""- although Erika Jo has a beautiful voice, I found the rendition lacking emotion.  She's a good singer but I hope her next album has some better material"
5,"I heard about these guys from that movie, Dig!, and I didn't know what to expect. Turns out, they're amazing. There's no comparison to the Dandy Warhols, none. Why they thought they were in competition with a hack band with a few hooks is beyond me. These guys are the real deal. If it wasn't for their lead singer making a jerk of himself and screwing up record deals (which is a storyline that you won't understand once you hear the thoughtful lyrics), these guys would be widely known as one of the best bands in the world. They sound like a throwback from the 60's, but slightly updated. The music is varied and intelligent as anything you've heard. I guess The Rolling Stones might be an apt comparison, but there's something more raw about this band. Look, if you were on the fence, just buy this, you won't be disappointed"
5,"It has been roughly one year since this album was released. As of today, I still find myself listening to it regularly, as this cd just has classic written all over it. The opening pair of songs are  nothing more than tastes of what is in store for the listener.  Queens of the Stone Age may not have Nick Oliveri in it, but you can tell that this cd still kicks. All of the elements fall into play, creating a cohesive piece of music that captures your mind. You will find yourself rocking out with Medication and Someone's in the Wolf. You may find yourself singing along to the singles Little Sister and In my Head. You may find yourself lamenting to Long Slow Goodbye and I Never Came. In fact, there is not one bad track on this album.  This one can be considered an overview of the band's output from their inceptiion to today, as most of the songs sound like they could be from another album. That is why this one is amazing. It is definitely Queens. It has the stoner grove from the first record, the pop elements from the second and the heavy parts from the previous effort. It also hints at what's in storage for us fans in the future.  Lullabies is utterly amazing. The high quality of the songs, as well as the tendency for you to hit the repeat button suggest this one to be a modern classic. It is the kind of cd that our kids will be listening to in about 20 years. Do yourself a favor. Pick it up. NOW"
5,"Back in the 40's and 50's (even the 30's going back to Milton Brown and Bob)Western Swing was in a class all it's own. Either you loved it or not,in most cases there was no inbetween. Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys swore to Great Fame as did Bob's steel player Leon. Milton Brown who started it all would of ruled the roost if not for his early death in the late 30's. Spade Cooley was a real favorite even had a TV show and at one time was bigger then them all except he ended up doing time for a murder rap. He was the first to coin the phrase ""Western Swing"". Over the years there were many others like Curly Williams,Tex Williams,Elton Brittand Pee Wee King to name a few.But when I want to hear some of the finest Swing music from who I believe to be the Greastest Western Swing song writer as well as artist there is only one choice,""Hank Penny and his Radio Cowboys"". Hank is about the most under rated Country and Western artist ever to go on the stage. His music is second to none and his lyrics can stop a coon in it's tracks! If you want to really get the best music that Hank ever put out it is essential to get this CD""Crazy Rhytm"" along with his 2CD set ""King of Hillbilly Bebop"". Both of these sets will open a whole new world of Western Swing to any listener. If you never heard of Hank Penny or heard his music you are in for a treat. His lead female singer was the great Jaye P. Morgan who had great fame in the 50's and 60's as a crooner. I admit that this music is not for everyone and i would bet that only about 10% of todays so called Country Music enthusiasts will apperciate this goldmine of classics. Hits like ""Flamin'Mamie"" and ""Peroxide Blond"" are some of the best ""Hillbilly"" music that will ever be recorded. ""Wide Open Spaces"" and ""Little Red Wagon"" are classics that only Hank could pull off.This is the real thing if your love of music is like mine (my wife has adopted ""Western Swing""as one of her favorite sounds also). Again please keep in mind if your idea of Country Music is watching some half baked,half naked, B-girl, bimbo on a perverted modern video that they now show on TV singing worthless songs that sound no more Country then Perry Como ,but just like pop hits from the 70's then this classic music ain't for you,believe me it ain't. If your idea of enjoying music is sitting back and listening to Ernest Tubb singing ""I'm like Driftwood on the River of Regret"" then I'm certain you will dig Hank!                              ""Enjoy"" Joe Kopec"
1,"Let me start by saying that I thought that Atmosphere's early albums were much better(Most of Atmosphere's current fans have no idea that they had other albums...)But Seven's Travels is Slug and Ant's transformation into a crappy sell-out group, and the first ever emo-rap group. The people that love this album are always some teenager, usually some emo-kid, who decide they like rap and Atmosphere after hearing this album. They jump onto the official Atmosphere bandwagon, but dont think that they listen to rap...they listen to ""rap"". These emo-rap kids love to talk about how much mainstream rap sucks and how much better Atmosphere is, and how underground is the best. (Dont think from this that I am a fan of mainstream rap, i'm just explaining)The number one sign you can tell from, even by just looking at these reviews, is if they start talking about how mainstream sucks(Naturally, these teenage kids like to be different, and can't stop talking about it)or how this is real true rap music. So, basically, these kids are part of the underground hip-hop backpacking club who love the only Atmosphere album they've ever heard, Sevens Travels and live out their little emo lives listening to Atmosphere(for about 3 months). Even if these people listen to Atmosphere's other albums ( which would totally make them the ultimate Atmosphere super-fan!)it makes no difference because Atmosphere is a crappy emo-rap group now. The purpose of this is to inform people that listen to real hip-hop that this album is not for them and that its for  emotionally-disturbed teenagers. Go buy some real hip-hop, and we can all let the emo-kids cry themselves to sleep listening to Sevens Travels"
5,"This year for our church Christmas concert, we are doing a collection of Michael W. Smith's Christmas music.  To my delight, two of the songs - Emmanuel and Christmas Hymn - were ones I fell in love with twenty years ago while listening to this collection on cassette.  Warm and bright, and still as fresh now as it was in the early 80's, this is still one of my favorite Amy Grant albums AND one of my favorite Christmas albums"
4,"I didn't find this CD to be as fabulous as careless love but, still enjoy it"
5,"My favourite performance of this classic Gilbert & Sullivan Operetta. Kevin Kline, Linda Ronstat, and the whole cast are perfect"
1,"I can't imagine why Mr. Andriessen's new opera Writing to Vermeer is garnering so much praise -- maybe ""you had to be there."" On CD, however, it's a grating, annoying, and self-consciously postmodern trial to endure... in fact, I finally had to just give up about halfway through the second disc. Life is too short, after all."
5,"As I said just above, this is a prime example of what I like to call Audio Art. From the dynamio begginning to the story song ending it is a great album through and through. It is more electric then their debut release but it's a welcomed change. Not that the debut was bad. The songs tell tales of broken hearts and the story song carries along a nice message of anti-suicide which is a welcome break from other bands out there.  I give it five stars because the music flows together so well, the quality is magnificent and the whole album is so through out and well laid that it deserves nothing less"
2,"Following up a critically acclaimed debut is probably one of the hardest things that an artist can do, and more often than not, the album falls well short of expectations, because they're so highly elevated.  ""Whip-Smart"" is a decent, albeit somewhat inconsistent album, but its pales in comparison to ""Exile in Guyville"", and that unfortunately is how it will always be thought.  Probably the most important thing about ""Whip-Smart"" is that its not Exile Part 2, while some songs maintain that sort of lo-fi sound/overt lyric gig that the previous record got so much mileage from (""X-Ray Man"", ""Crater Lake""), the album actually does best when it drifts further away from the territory of Exile-- from the noise guitar over the familiar melody of ""Chopsticks"" to the haunting, moody, ""Shane', where the tension is almost palpable to the brilliant, chugging ""Jealousy"".  Like Exile, it excels when the tension is at its highest, unlike Exile, its a lot brighter sounding.  Still, for all the good stuff on here, it sounds like Phair wasn't quite ready to issue a followup.  Several experiments in different veins sound incomplete (""Alice Springs""), fall apart (""Support System"", ""Go West"") or are plain irritating (""Cinco de Mayo"", ""May Queen"").  Its got its moments, but ""Whip-Smart"" is largely disposable-- start with Phair's debut, ""Exile in Guyville"", its everything its regarded as"
1,"I have to admit, like others, I bought this CD just because I was excited to have another collection of Three Dog Night songs.  I was so disappointed when I played it and realized it was really only two dogs.  Without Chuck, there is no Three Dog Night.  They can package it the same way, call it by the same name, but it's not.  These vocals are nothing more than lack luster covers of the originals, certainly not the wonderful vocals we have come to know and love.  I agree with another reviewer here...why can't they listen to the words of ""Easy to be Hard"" and patch things up?  If the Eagles can do it, the Dogs should be able to as well.  Eager fans are waiting for some new harmony!  Oh yeah, and this CD, I threw it away"
4,"I KID YOU NOT!..he ghost wrote 7 of the 15 tracks on private times for Al B. Sure..ask yourself this question: how come you never actually saw a picture of Kyle West?...Hmm?  Overall,a really good album.i wouldn't recommend buying the first one but this one i do :) "
5,"This is Bob Dylan at his very finest and this is probably his best record, from ""Like a Rolling Stone"" to the album's closer, ""Desolation Row,"" the listener is assaulted with blistering images in rhyme that she will never forget. Dylan changed the shape of the musical landscape with this record, changed rock and roll forever. His songs broke the three minute mold, they weren't about love and love lost anymore. In fact some of them are darned hard to understand, but they stay with you none the less. Bob Dylan was, and is, the poet laureate of Rock and Roll, the poet laureate of America. Love after we're all gone, his lyrics will be sung, recited, read"
4,"&quot;Two of a Mind&quot; is a studio-only project from the summer of 1962. Desmond had done a record led by Gerry several years prior, and it was Mulligan's turn to play with Paul on a project he would control. Because of heavy workloads, the two principals collaborated in three separate sessions during June, July and August in New York. Also due to scheduling difficulties, the rhythm section changed at each session. On the six tunes which made the original LP, there are three different bassists and two different drummers. Also on the six LP selections, Desmond did a little studio trickery: some of the improvised solos were put together from different sessions, and on one tune he overdubbed a third saxophone for one verse. If you didn't know this, however, you'd never guess it. The counterpoint improvs of Gerry on baritone and Paul on alto are consistently interesting. Overall the disc is more uptempo than Desmond's other work as a leader. The product lacks that special magic which can often be found on a good recording by a quartet which plays live together and often, but it is a subtle loss. This reissue adds five bonus tracks, including two with guitarist Jim Hall which did not make Desmond's final list for LP inclusion, but which are quite nice. The two leads are highly skilled, and they seemed to like each other a lot and to bring out good things for one another. Not Desmond's best work by a long shot, nor Mulligan's, but worth owning if you are partial to either man. I'm glad BMG is doing these Bluebird First Edition releases from the RCA vaults. The booklets are usually quite good. They come in cardboard cases instead of jewel cases, and I'm not sure if I like that or not yet. Maybe they  could knock a dollar or two off the price and be an even better value, but if, like me, you enjoy the classic jazz of the 1946-'66 generation, you should buy some of these reissues to encourage the company to keep them coming"
5,"I listen to a ton of trance artists in the psychadelic/goa esque genre, and I must say that I have yet to hear anything that can even remotely compare to Infected Mushroom. The originality, detail, and craftsmanship that goes into their music is quite frankly amazing. B.P. Empire is one of many amazing Infected Mushroom albums. Generally it is a bit more ambient, and on some tracks possibly a bit more somber than some of their other realeases, but never the less it is a great album. My personal favorite tracks are Noise Maker and P.G.M.. Dancing With Kadafi is a track which is more of an experimental track, which appears to be the birth of the second disc from Converting Vegetarians (which is an experimental or like IM says, &quot;other side&quot; to Infected Mushroom which is like everything else they do, incredible.). Like all Infected Mushroom albums, the quality of the production of B.P. Empire is among incredible. One of the most amazing aspects of Infected Mushroom is their ability to cleanly mix a multitude of synth and percussion sounds simultaneously and make the mix sound tight and refined, and not like a huge mess. They are quite an amazing group, and at the time are probably my favorite artist in any genre. I also find it amazing how many people that I have showed Infected Mushroom to, that don't even listen to trance, are hooked on Infected Mushroom. I highly suggest that you pick up their albums if you love trance and have an open mind. I promise you will not regret it"
1,"I like what Phil Rogers said about CETACEAN. But to me, CETACEAN doesn't sound surfadelic so much as cheezadelic. As a matter of fact, it's arguably the apotheosis of mod-a-go-go cheezpop. SUSAN doesn't impress me. I don't hear what nicjaytee hears in it.  CJ & The Fish also did a few tracks for a soundtrack called ZACARIAH. And ZACARIAH isn't included at amazon. So allow me to say something about it here. Ya know all of those song lyrics wherein the singer brags about the modesty of his needs? Well, let it be known that Barry Melton wrote a parody of that obnoxious mentality in a tune called ALL I NEED: ""All I need to have a good time is a reefer, a woman, and a bottle of wine. With those 3 things I don't need no sunshine. A reefer, a woman, and a bottle of wine. All I want is to never grow old. I want to wash in a bathtub of gold. I want 97 kilos already rolled. I want to wash in a bathtub of gold. I wanna light my cigars with 10-dollars bills. I'd like to have a cattle ranch in Beverly Hills. I'd like a bottle of red-eye that's always filled. I'd like to have a cattle ranch in Beverly Hills."
1,"I really gave this album a chance.  There were even a couple of moments where I thought that a song had a particularly good (in a cheesy way) 80's arena rock riff.  But without fail, even the songs that start out ""good"", turn into generic forgettable 80's rock -- you know the type that littered the early 80's music scene and all sounded as if it was written by some studio executive and a computer.    I guess there is no accounting for taste, and everyone can have their opinions.  Unless you are REALLY into early 80's power ballads, however, don't even think about getting this album"
2,"This album is written for people that are emotionally 16 years old and insane.  Every song is from the point of a disenfranchised boy moaning at the world.  The end of 'I'm gonna love her for both of us', when he keeps saying the title with different inflections...don't you just picture Rainman rocking in a corner somewhere?  And if she doesn't love him back, he'll kill her!  Unless she's in bed with a group of his best friends??  No wonder 'Everything is Permitted.'  This is bad.  The production is bad, the tone of the guitar is godawful, Meat's voice sounds worse on this cd than any of his others by far (I know he lost his voice and was doing weird things to try to get it back.  I don't hold it against him, but I'm the one that has to listen to it.)  The band is fine, and I like some of the actual music.  It's the song titles and lyrics that are awful"
5,"The almighty Unearth has returned to us with a brand new EP entitled Endless. Picking up right where 'The Stings Of Conscience' left off, this Massachusetts metal machine is ready to kick your teeth in once more. First of all the new material is more metal if you can believe that. The song Endless could very well be the greatest hardcore song erver written. The track kicks off with Susi and Mcgrath going absolutly ape... on their axes and Trevor spitting some of the most truthful and inspiring lyrics ever written. The track ends with one of the most monstrous breakdowns I have ever experienced. Awesome .... Internal War is an anti war song and here we witness some absolute sick skin smashing from Mike Rudberg. The pace is fast as Susi and Mcgrath lead the way accompenied by Phipps as he belts out words of truth: 'Power in the wrong hands, our scaffold is destroyed, children killing children cuz the government has ignorned, I sling my arrow to shatter your walls, no more creating victims from ignorance'. I loved The Charm, because its like an old guitar driven eighties metal tune sounding like something  Shadows Fall may write. Once again gutiars fly all over the place and Trevor sounding like a psychotic madman. This is followed with some sick breakdowns and some bad... solos. The last track My Desire also appeared on their full length. I for one do not really dig EPs, but Unearth is one of my favorite bands so I gave em a 5. If you dig any European influenced metalcore or just plain old hardcore, Unearth is the band for you, and I for one can not wait for a new full length"
5,"I never get tired of listening to this CD, and I like all of the songs on it.  His lyrics are so weird and interesting.  The music is so original. Great anywhere... in the car, cleaning the house, during a party, working out, etc"
4,"I'm always looking for good prog rock, experimental etc...whatever you want to call it. Been listerning since the late 60's early 70's to everything from Zappa, Van Der Graaf, PFM, Genesis, T-heads, Yes ....you get the drift. Bought this CD (like many others I've bought) just to try something new.  My first impression after a few tunes was...guess this ones gonna be collecting dust! But, I stuck to it and listened to the whole CD with an open mind. A lot of little things, quirky things, odd things jumped out at me...some cool melodies, guitar riffs, moments of dissonant chaos followed by structure. Music that I honestly can't say I've heard, or imagined before. Wow! This album has grown on me. I've already bought 3 more or their previous releases and am looking forward to giving in to the unusual and addicting music that is deerhoof"
2,"As much as I like most of the songs on this CD...it's just too short. Also the production is lousy.  The recording quality sounds awful in places. Hopefully, the updated compilations are better. This one is not worth the money!!!"
1,I am a big U2 fan and I don't really like this.  There are a couple really good songs on it but other than that... not for the average listener
5,"I've been listining (and singing along) to this album for yaers. It's got all the best Patsy, pure Patsy (not too overloaded with background singers). Just buy it"
1,"The first song is GREAT, but after that the album just doesNOT compare to the first one.  Sorry I bought it.  Too much SCREAMING for me. "
5,"This is the best ALbert Collins CD you can buy. The guitar playing is amazingly wild. Its one of the great blues albums ever, it certainly has the feeling of a great live seesion in the studio. All the different styles of blues that MR collins played are well represented here: shuffles, slow blues, minor blues, fast sinstrumentals, etc. More satisfying than any compilation. Warning: you'll want more after this"
2,"Thank You for the c.d. in great condition.  We had fast service and would gladly do business with you again.  Thanks again, N and L C"
5,"This is most possibly the illest rap cd to ever hit stores. The two headed monsta Black C and Mr Cee, along with company, Cellski and Hitman put together pounding beats, sick flows, and sweet hooks. The rhymes are very creative. The highlights of this album be ""Blue Bird"" best track on the LP, ""Bounce to this"" gets your pumped for the album. ""I Got my nine"". ""Niggaz on the jock"" ""M.N.O.H.P"" ""Pass the zig zags"" and ""Dedication"" but all the tracks pound. This gem from RBL Posse is a must have for any west coast rap fan"
2,"Lisa Lisa &amp; Cult Jam, guilty pleasure of the middle 80's scene, she was the queen of Freestyle by that time, her music was around every club, and her style will remain in many people minds.  Her sounds were extremely danceable, although some people thought that her voice was a little bit squirky and anoying, it fitted just great to the type of music she wanted to approach, even her hit ballad &quot;All Cried Out&quot; a bittersweet melody with amazing lyrics, that will be covered later by many, fitted her just great, but undoubtly her greatest achievment was dance music, &quot;Head To Toe&quot;, &quot;Lost In Emotion&quot;, where #1's the same year and make everybody love this, sadly she became lost in more pop oriented tunes with the next albums, saving only &quot;Let The Beat Hit Em&quot; that it's truly a comeback to the dance music scene, but too late, the magic was lost and we should point to &quot;Little Jackie Wants To Be A Star&quot; as guilty for throwing Lisa's career to oblivion, but if you forget that and concentrate on the early materials you will find an artist that surface out of the bunch, because they were talented and had a new flavor to offer to the public"
5,"After the last few albums I was losing hope but DAMN this one rocks! Highlights are definitely Die Dead Enough, The Scorpion, Kick The Chair, Back In The Day, Of Mice and Men, and Tears In A Vial. The rest are mediocre but ho wmany albums do you buy anymore with so many great songs"
2,"Couple good renditions but pretty poor sonics and a number of forgettable tunes. Their studio album ""It's a Beautiful Day"" remains the one to own"
5,I HOPE THAT FREDDIE IS WELL AND HOPE TO SEE YOU ALL SOON. WISHING YOU ALL THE BEST IN LIFE. LIFE IS WHAT YOU MAKE IT. YOU MAKE IT EASY LISTENING  HAPPY HOLIDAYS TO AL
1,"With Edward McGee's whiny vocal arrangements coupled with lyrics such as, &quot;I can't stand to see the slaughter, but still I eats the meat&quot;, this album's &quot;chops&quot; are nothing but mindless butchery. The  torture continues with sappy tracks like &quot;You Ought to be Having  Fun&quot; and &quot;Make Someone Happy&quot;. What would truly make me  happy is throwing this album into a bonfire and roasting it to a crisp,  golden brown. Eating this tainted &quot;meat&quot; will leave you with a  bad taste in your mouth. Bon Appetite "
4,"Sometimes I still can't believe the constant quality of Joni Mitchell's discography from the early days in 1968 up until 1980. Mitchell released several masterpieces, not only the well-known Blue and Court & Spark, but also the 'transitional' albums For The Roses annd Hissing Of Summer Lawns can be marked as totally perfect works of art as far as I'm concerned. From there on things got less accesible but actually even more interesting, as Mitchell plunged into the depths of jazz, classical and even African music on Don Juan's Reckless Daughter.   The album takes some time to get used to, but the end-result is a flawed yet fully satisfying album like Blue. Here Mitchell just went through the roof and shamelessly recorded an African drum-and-chant piece (The Tenth World), awkward minimalist-music (the gorgeous Dreamland) and a 16-minute song that packed folk, jazz and classical into one mindblowing piece called Paprika Plains. The other songs continue where Hejira ended, most notably the lovely Jericho and Talk To Me.   The endresult is simply a fantastic record, that many people had problems with upon the original time of release. Too experimental, too weird, too out-there. That may be, but fact is that Don Juan's Reckless Daughter stands as Joni Mitchell's most interesting and boldy innovative work. Ever."
1,"I purchased this as it said it was enhanced with music; it is not enhanced with music, just ocean surf sounds"
5,"This CD has a wonderful selection of songs. I was a little worried at first that they wouldn't be ""original"", but you will not be disappointed. I recommend this CD highly!!!"
2,"i despise this. there is absoluetly no point of listening to this, for you are missing out on ALL of jonathan larsons creation- and it isn't fair to the listener OR the creator. i woudln't waste my money on this. if anything, give it as a present, or as sort of an INTRODUCTION to RENT, but bits and pieces of the magic just is wrong. even if it claims to be ""the best of rent""- i disagree, the BEST of rent is jonathan larsons creation in its entirety"
5,"fans of too short shouild get this features erik sermon, goldy, mc bred, baby d spice 1, shock g, and other goodies definitely a must have plus for old heads shorty b does his tribute to maggot brain with the funkadelic inspired title track sho nuf funky"
2,"the vocals are hella cool but the lyrics are g.ay, and i the layering could have been better.  I kinda like this band but i think  this album could have been alot more then it was. oh well what do i know, i am not doing what their doing, im siting on a computer crying about it, oh well whatever their lucky but i still hate this album, but its still semi ok but just not for me, it make me  yaw"
5,"It seems like when it comes to the Pixies, the talk is generally ""Surfer Rosa this"" and ""Doolittle that,"" and while those are certainly good albums I've never figured out why Bossanova got so much less attention than its two predecessors.  With the exception of Trompe Le Monde (which I plan on getting around to eventually, I swear) I've heard pretty much the Pixies' whole output, and out of of everything this album keeps me coming back the most often.  Bossanova turns down the noise assaults from the Pixies' earlier career down just a bit, but in their place is a more arty, spacey effort that throws some heavy surf-rock influence into the band's already wide-ranging sound.  Sure, there may not be anything that completely matches the sheer visceral immediacy of Broken Face or Tame, but for track-by-track excellence and diversity Bossanova is difficult if not impossible to top.    After the blistering, hard-rocking instrumental opener Cecilia Ann sets the tone, Bossanova immediately commences careening all over the musical map in a way the legions of alternative imitators that emerged in the 90's wouldn't even dream of.  With Black Francis screaming his head off at full volume, the angry, assaultive Rock Music sounds like Debaser on steroids, but from there the album takes a turn into more diverse and overall compelling territory that sounds little like previous albums.  Songs constantly veer off in unpredictable directions, making Bossanova more of an acquired taste than its predecessors, but it's one more than worth acquiring.  This album represents the Pixies' peak as musicians (at least to that point); the rawer edges from Surfer Rosa and Doolittle had definitely been toned down, but those albums didn't contain anything quite like the complex, Talking Heads-like rhythms of Dig For Fire or the dense, proto-grunge sheets of guitar noise of Down to the Well.  The Pixies' legendary use of dynamics was also honed to perfection here: just check out the way the whiplash guitars kick in at the perfect time in the soaring, etheral Velouria, or the way Black Francis's eery vocals and Kim Deal's crawling bassline give way to the headbanging chorus of Is She Weird.    All Over the World is one of the strangest things the Pixies ever did, a sprawling epic (by Pixies standards, anyway) filled with spacey lyrics and searing lead guitar lines from Joey Santiago that seem to come out of nowhere.  And is that a falsetto Black Francis is doing with his voice?  Well, yeah, most of the time, but it works perfectly for the song's trippy, drug-like feel.  Even when they're plowing ahead at full speed, as on Allison and Hang Wire, the band's more tuneful, surf-rock direction is apparent, but it's even more evident on pleasant, literally pacific tracks like Ana and the closing Havalina.    My enduring favorite from this album, though, would have to be Happening.  It doesn't start off all that unusually for a Pixies song, with Black Francis screaming his bizarrely imagistic lyrics on top of some slashing guitars and atomic bass riffs, but over its running time it just gets progressively eerier and more demented, with lots of surfy breaks popping up in the mix, culminating in Black Francis's stream-of-consciousness, half-spoken-half-sung mantra as the song fades out.  It's a total classic, just like this album, and essential listening for those who want to hear alternative rock from back when the label meant something"
1,"Oh my god... how can be possible that such a talented composer had to fall in such deep nonsense, remaking a whole bunch of old tunes to end up like something much worse than even Muzak?  This is the music you'll hear again and again at the supermarket, just sufficiently engineered to num the brain.  Kiss of Life is the only light of hope (and that's why this CD gets 1 star - otherwise should be zero, or even negative!) but that's only because I love Sade"
5,"Truly the best of Ennio Morricone's music: very exciting, diverse and colorful, this CD is a great value. If you like Morricone's music, you'll probably love Arye Geiman - a yet unknown, but young and promising composer, whose music is also very melodic.  [..."
2,"This outing from Steve Wilson and Aviv Geffen was a big disappointment to me. For one, there are no standout songs on this cd. Its all one big mish mosh. I figured that this would be at least as strong as the first Blackfield cd. The songwriting seems weak and slapped together. They are going to have do something spectacular if I buy another cd of theirs. Also the song ""Where is my love"" shouldn't have been redone. It should have been left off this cd"
1,"I bought this CD because this band is from my home town and I've heard good things about them.I hate to have to bash my own city but if these guys are the best Vegas has to offer I don't see much hope for our Rock Scene.This band is no different from most of the other bands you hear on the Nu-Rock stations.It  reminds me of 70's bubble gum pop.Sure some of the songs are catchy,but in a David Cassidy sort of way.The singer sounds like he should be working on the Vegas strip as a Cher Impersonator instead of attempting to sing in a rock band.The Drummer is Boring.His style is Rigid,and it lacks soul.The Guitar players riffs are Flat and uncreative. Every song is about a girlfriend,or breaking up with a girlfriend...Nothing special here.It's todays Glam rock, nothing more...Save your cash"
1,"I am so dissapointed in this CD. I bought it because I have ""Blow By Blow"" and ""Jeff Beck with the Jan Hammer Group"" and I love those CDs. This crap sounds like somebody that heard those recordings, practiced for one week and tried to do an imitation of them. I don't like one cut on the entire CD. I only gave it one star because I couldn't find a way to give it less."
2,"I wanted to like this album, but it simply doesn't compare to Leftism. Leftism was way ahead of it's time and is full of sounds that practially tickle your ears whereas Rhythm & Stealth is full of sounds that are ugly and not nearly as pleasant to listen to. This is my synopsis and apparently I'm not alone as this CD sells for much cheaper on the used market than Leftism.  My advice? Don't miss Leftism but skip Rhythym & Stealth"
5,"There are still those that claim that electronic music is soul-less.  Its made by people on computers who aren't necessarily musicians and don't play any real instruments, therefore they say it lacks the human element that other genres incorporate to move their audience.  Well for those of you still trapped in that mindset I invite you to check out ""One"".  Not only does this record defy that thought but it should enhance your opinion of the capabilites and potential of progressive electronic music.  I was not aware of Dierdre prior to this solo debut however her previous projects were I believe more world/ethno music in nature.  ""One"" is truly a blend of electronic, techno, world & soul and even flirts with the lighter side of drum and bass.  The vocals needless to say are nothing short of breathtaking.  Highlights are the opener ""Waiting For Spring"", ""Close To Us"" & my personal favorite ""A Way To Love"".  Also included and I believe the 1st emphasis track is an unrecognizable cover of The Moody Blues ""Nights In White Satin"".  This record is truly fantastic in every regard and a great reminder of how good electronic music can be"
5,"I became a DOORS fan way back when they released their first album. Forty years later most of their music still bends my ear.  This elaborate box set is worth seeking out, especially given the limited numbers available.  I read some reviews about the CD remixes that were disappointing.  Well, folks, they were wrong.  And if that's all you're looking for they are being released as single CDs in the very near future.  I wanted this for the DTS DVD AUDIO discs that bring this set to twelve discs. Nevermind the historic but boring videos tagged on.  The DTS surround sound  is nothing less than stunning.  From Strange Days through LA Woman, the recordings were obviously meant to be heard this way. The remixes only enhance my favorites.  And this begs my next plea: I have this set, I have Talking Heads Dual Disc BRICK, and Pet Sounds, and the Beatles LOVE, and Lyle Lovett's JOSHUA JUDGES RUTH, Richard Thompson, etc., all in 5.1 surround and/or DTS.   I would really enjoy the Beatles catalogue in DTS, as well as most of Joni Mitchell's catalogue. And Michael Jackson, Dwight Yoakam, Steely Dan, Tom Waits, and any other artist whose music is marked by originality AND impeccable recordings.  The success of PERCEPTION should be a positive indicator that there are tons of music whackos like me willing to shell out hard cash for items like this.  All you record companies that are so worried about pirating and downloading?  Not us! Give us what we want, (and these aren't downloadable)!  Win win! Sony dropped the ball bigtime with SACD, don't let us down like they did!"
2,"Authors note: For some reason I rated this album a 2 out of 5 stars, although I thought I had rated a bit higher, and since I can't change that ""star-rating"" now, I will say this:  This album is good, borderline great at times, and shows at a lot of promise. It's hyper and rough around the edges, but a lot of fun. It contains a handful good songs, and few great ones, here are a few of the standouts:  ""Bicycle, Bicycle, You Are My Bicycle"", and ""Adventure"", are both good...Although I feel that ""We Will Vacation, You Can Be My Parasol"" is a better song, and had they played around with it a bit more in the studio, it could have ""the single"", but it's a great song either way.  The next portion I would like to direct to members BYOP:  Whatever muse you guys followed to come up with ""October, First Account"", keep following it, and if need be, hold it hostage at gunpoint. That song is ""the single"" of the entire album, and if you can recapture that same mojo a bit more on the next album, the skies the limit. "

5,"If you love untainted hymns, you will be blessed by these lofty recorded selections performed by the London Philharmonic Choir and National Philharmonic Orchestra. Two discs compress over fifty hymns to be savored over and over. And no...these are not light and airy, please-every-ear compositions, but are the solid rock truths of the faith. You can even attune to the atoning blood of Christ harmoniously exalted.   My only displeasure was found in the absence of sing along lyrics. To decipher all the stanzas, owning a hymnbook is a must. It is important to obtain one while supplies still exist...I am not completely kidding. My husband and I were at a used book sale where a man was overjoyed to actually find a hymnbook. He wanted to learn the comprehensive praises that are cunningly being pushed out the back door of most churches.   "
5,"When I first heard a song from this album (Sliding Doors) I was driving on I-5, on my way to Pasadena. I pulled off and bought the CD. I give it half a star over the 4 rating, and it would it be worth 5 if the boys had axed &quot;Right Kind of Girl&quot;. There is something painful about the 'siamese cat' line. Probably I just don't get it. &quot;Your Big Night&quot; is Steely Dan adeptly finessed into the 90s. &quot;Star Behind&quot; may have been inspired by The Moody Blues or the Hale-Bopp cult troop, I dunno, but I like the pulsating yet dreamy arrangement. My fave track is &quot;All Dreamed Out&quot;. It is a Satin Doombox"

5,"i've got a few of the Colosseum cd's and i've never been terribly impressed with them...but this incarnation of the band is something else entirely. they take a much more rock approach and prog it out with fantastic results. the pace is driving and speeds along with purpose and supreme musicianship. every song is full of intricate time changes, killer solos, and great vocals. the second disc is a fine addition to the original. there's no sign of a filler cut...it's all outstanding stuff! a nice surprise, overall. i'm hooked"
5,"This is one of the best collections of any band ever compiled! Comes with the classics by Keith and Gregg Ginn that put, black flag on the map!  You just can't go wrong with the quick yet catchy songs that just stay in your head all day long. Fix Me and Wasted are a quick blur and that's how punk songs should be. Not some sort of Opera rock that goes on for nine and a half minutes long... Six Pack was always a funny song to sing along.  ""What are we gonna do!?! the t.v. is broken!!! OH NO we're gonna miss our favorite shows!!""  ""my girlfriend asked me which i liked better i hope she doesn't leave me""  It's kinda of a two for one album when you listen to it because both vocalist brought their own style to the band.  Find out what the fuss is over this band and pick up a classic comp!"
5,"For an artist that has helped shape the musical map since the 70's, and remained a sterling producer, and also has a album workrate to put most musicians to shame, it's truly surprising that Brian Eno, has so many absolutely essential albums to his name.  Here we concentrate on the period where he Created/Produced a series of defining 'Ambient' albums in the mid-late 70's, that although not the first to produce ambient albums, mastered the form to such a degree, that some 20-30 years on, these albums are frequently referenced, when discussing the genre.   Although as much an electronic album as it is an ambient album, the mood here is one of detached sounds, restrained instruments and a slightly Eerie, and atmospheric solitude.  using a system of two reel-to-reel tape recorders, and making the (relatively) simple process of layering sounds on top of one another, Eno was able to make stark simple sounds, from such instruments as...keyboard, synth, organ, but layer them in such a way that although the music rarely changes direction, it's beauty comes in the form of its simplicity.  The first track...the epic ""Discreet Music"" is really nothing more than a melancholic & slight sounding relaxation drone.  But its what Eno does with the sound and the use of spacial sound, that truly makes this impressive.   Brief compositions of synth are gradually brought in and out of the mix, and although most listeners won't realise it on the first listen, but the relation of these elements changes over time, albeit it very gradually, and coupled with the subtle use of noise and resonance, it reveals a sound of soothing 'ambience' that washes over the listener.  The ""Three Variations on the Canon in D Major"" is more consistent with the stylisation of 'Classical' music, with it less akin to 'Ambient' music, and more in keeping with the compositional elegance and arrangement of piano led orchestration.  which has a  rather melancholy and restless feel to it, and the tone of the strings/piano feels vastly different to the synth-led first track, and its arguably the more immediate track, due to its more noticeable increase in volume/tempo, and although a more rounded sound, still remains very delicate and gentle.  In fact imagine these beautifully crafted tracks as works for soundtracks  for films that were never filmed, as it's deeply beguiling and littered with the romanticism that became a trademark in Eno's series of 'Ambient' Albums.  As it's all so precisely performed and tremendously realised, that one can't help but fall in love with this incredible album.   If you picked up any of Eno's other 'Ambient' albums, I really can't stress enough, how utterly recommended this album comes, It's not only considered one of his finest 'Ambient' albums, but also just a truly exceptional album regardless of the genre.   Utterly Essentia"

5,"This wonderful collection of stories is a favorite of mychildren. My children ask for this one again and again, but I enjoyhearing the masterfully told stories so much, I don't mind hearing it over and over myself"
2,Listening to this cd took me back to my growing-up years.  I remembered all their songs I loved back then.  It's a great homecoming
2,"""Nonsuch"" is one of those records that I think was doomed to failure-- having constructed (with a little help from Todd Rundgren) a thematic song cycle (""Skylarking"") and an album of perhaps the best pop music in two decades (""Oranges & Lemons""), the bar was set pretty high for XTC, and in an attempt to reach it, they seemed to have overreached a bit.  It's not that the album is bad per se, it's just so carefully arranged and produced to have lost the edge that made its predecessors so great.  The band seems to have distilled themselves down to midtempo numbers, occasionally finding a bit of a driving electric sound (opener ""The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead""), but largely sticking to a quieter, balladry style, often primarily piano driven.  Sometimes it works out quite nicely, the lovely, chirping staccato guitars on ""Humble Daisy"" provide ample support for a simply fantastic lead vocal by Andy Partridge, and certainly the lilting off-rhythm of ""Then She Appeared"" is downright captivating, but more likely than not, the pieces end up blending one into another as pretty much unmemorable pop songs that are inoffensive and ok but just not attention getting (Colin Moulding's ""My Bird Performs"", Partridge's ""The Disappointed"").  To cap things off, the album stretches over an hour long, and by the end of the record, even the more intriguing material (""The Ugly Underneath"") seems to blend in with the rest.  It's tough though, becaue none of it is particularly bad, and in fact, all sorts of neat stuff is going on throughout-- great three part harmonies (Brian Wilson style with a falsetto over the top) catch the ear on ""Dear Madam Barnum"", ""Wrapped in Grey"" twists and turns every which way, ""War Dance"" features an intriguing clarinet opening that leads into a set of reeds providing support for Moulding's venomous lyrics... it goes on.  In fact, with such detailed arrangements, everything's guaranteed to be interesting in some regard, but what it lacks is that feeling of spontaneity and energy.  One nice thing is that at least with this reissue and its remastered sound, you can make out the subtleties of the record nicely.  Bottom line, there's a lot better by XTC-- ""Nonsuch"" is an ok record, but they've done a whole lot more"
5,"I've loved this CD ever since we got it at my college radio station... Sarge definitely knows how to rock! At the same time, the band shows good range so each song doesn't sound the same.  I especially love the lyrics,  which express a spectrum of raw emotion and real-life issues, from a girl's  revenge for getting gang-raped to thoughts on &quot;how far is too  far?&quot;.  The vocals are never overpowered by the music (which says a  lot because the music is definitely kickass)"
5,"Hello there people looking into buying THUG LIFE VOLUME 1.  i would first like to start with a little information on THUG LIFE which was the name of a rap group which featured 2pac, big syke, mopreme and a few other's. if you are a 2pac fan you may of already heard of this album although this album is one of 2pacs most unrecornised albums and when 2pac founded the group in 1993 they where quite unknown to the public and it was only after 2pac was shoot when people noticed the album.   the THUG LIFE group may better today be known as the OUTLAWZ with big syke changing his name to MUSSILINI on the outlawz albums 2pac to MAKAVELI, MOPREME did not stay with the group when they changed there names to the OUTLAWZ which was a shame due to the fact MOPREME was one of the better rappers on the THUG LIFE album, he was also the son of the late MUTULU shakur which was 2pacs stepfather. mutulu is mentioned alot in 2pacs older albums due to the fact mutulu was there for tupac and tupac saw him as a father figure,  even though mutulu was placed on the FBI's MOST WANTED LIST after escaping from prison in the 80's tupac looked up to him.   the name THUG LIFE is a name 2pac called the group with the meaning : The Hate U Gave Little Infants F**k Every1 which spells out thug life if you use the first letter in every word.  the notoious B.I.G was also meant to join the group when they had first started but the record label desided against it and removed b.i.g  * THE ALBUM * This is a old classic album and fans of tupac would be expected to have this place near the top shelf of any cd rack, due to tupacs death the rise of price's to shakurs albums means they have shoot up quite a lot and you could be expected to pay from $15 and upwards per album but at the moment i think this album is going rather cheap.  if your a fan of ALL EYEZ ON ME and alot of tupacs latier stuff and style then this album may not be your best album to buy, tupac is often well know for his poetic rhyming and graphic lyrics but this album is more hardcore and talk's about diffrent topics in one song rather then the song telling a story of just one topic ie: tear drops and close caskets  there seems to be more of a darker side to this album and although the album is diffrent to shakurs newer stuff this album is still a brilliant album, ( i didn't leave this album to be the last one to buy till i finished my pac collection, i think it was the 3rd i bought )  there are some brilliant songs on this album, songs like HOW LONG WILL YOU MORN ME in memory for kado (R.I.P) Which also D.M.X. does a memorial for KADO at the end of WHERE THE HOOD AT vidoe  even if you buy the album for HOW LONG WILL THEY MORN ME it is still money well spent due to the song been such a classic with great lyrics and a brilliant choaros by NATE DOGG, there are other great song on there too with great basic background beats of the drums with a funky tune the come over the drums. plent of song reach out and touch you when listening to the lyrics and you will find your self listening to the album more and more once you own it, also the lyrics are easy to pick up on and means easier to sing along with (we all like a good sing along) i would recomend this album to first time buyer's and defo to old 2pac fans who havn't got it yet.    thank you for taking the time to read my review, i hoped it help you in your choice. please feel free to leave coments and to also look at my other reviews by clicking on ""see all reviews"" button next to my name"
4,"This is a fine creation of the 80's, with many classic songs.  But we must not overlook the fact that the best song on here was not even released. It's name: &quot;The Working Hour.&quot; Check it out it is haunting"
4,"I noticed that all the reviews are pretty short, so I'll try and keep mine short, as well. I bought this album around seven or eight years ago when I was a bachelor and living in a 600 square foot backhouse. Because my personal dwelling space was so small, I wanted to create an illusion that my place was big, spacious and open and I did that not only through carefully choosing my furniture and accessories, but by creating  a ""big atmosphere"" through the music I chose to play when I had guests over.  Whenever I played this CD at dinner parties I threw, people literally stopped and noticed the music. I had a few people snicker and say that the music was silly and outdated, but for the most part, people really seemed to enjoy it and paid less attention to the obvious fact that everyone was crammed in my little place like sardines in a can.  What I'm suggesting is that this music has a lot of heart, a lot of soul, a lot of punch for the buck. If you find yourself listening to the same old music, you might just want to pick up this CD and expose yourself to something so cool, it's hot"
2,"I Like About 3 or 4 songs on here. I hate to sound negative but what i do not like about this cd is that, Jo'Omeara sounds very pitchy in most of the songs...Her voice starts to sound flat and very monotone after 1 or 2 songs. She Does'nt have much range. She Just raises her voice. Her voice sounds shakey and unstable. especially on ""Relentless"" the very first track. I love the song,i really do but her voice sounds like any minute shes gonna break down and cry. I am not a great singer myself but,Jo Omeara needs some voice lessons. Her voice is very drab and boring. It's Nothing extra.   For some reason she sounded so much better with S Club 7...you know what,the songs on the album are great,if Kelly Clarkson or Jessica Simpson sang them. I listen to the songs and just imagine ""what if...""...it gets me through the songs i like"
1,This album really sucks.  The only good song on it is the last song on the tape
5,"I'd never thought I'd like Debbie Gibson, but I guess I was wrong.  Most of her songs on this CD are great, and I aboulutely love them.  I personally like ""Out of the Blue"", ""Foolish Beat"", ""Only in my Dreams"" and ""Shake Your Love"". They are all good songs.  She is very talented and mauture for her age. Although I wasn't a teen back then, I have heard of her.  If you like 80's music and are a Debbie fan, then this CD is for you. This CD gets me going whenever I listen to it. I like pop music and 80's music for that matter too. Hope this review is helpful to you. "
1,"I bought this album unheard because I was such a fan of Prince.  Bad move.  I agree with the last reviewer.  I tried to like it.  I really did.  But, there is nothing on here worth listening to, let alone dancing to.  The subject matter didn't bother me (he's certainly been controversial before), but I listened to the entire album straight through and couldn't tell where one song began and another ended.  Bored now.  Only buy this if you're a completist"
5,"Only die hard fans of GERSHWIN should buy the massive songbook ELLA AND NELSON RIDDLE made in 1959 ,because the great songs are all included here.Back in those days ,GERSHWIN was still considered the best AMERICAN composer, probably because he was the only one who tried the classical experience and succeeded ,and also because of the fact that he died young.Nowadays we know that RICHARD RODGERS and JOHNNY MERCER are the deserving legends of AMERICAN popular music.Having said that let me say that this collection is perfect,it's really the best.Personal favorites of mine are SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME and BUT NOT FOR ME.Even the guy from TEXAS should enjoy that one"
5,"This excellent 1975 album shows Hatfield & the North adopting a full blown Canterbury rock sound - a nice mixture of quirky prog and jazz rock.  Although folks refer to a Canterbury style before 1975 (I include myself here too), the bands lumped under the Canterbury style pre-1975 were incredibly disparate and utilized a broad spectrum of musical styles.  The Henry Cow (experimental) - Caravan (pop prog) continuum comes to mind in fact.  It was not until the mid-1970s however, that a distinct Canterbury sound emerged (quirky, proggy, jazz rock) and this album is a superb example.  The core lineup includes a virtual who's who of Canterbury rock: Phil Miller (guitars); drummer Pip Pyle; Richard Sinclair (vocals, bass guitar); and Dave Stewart (Hammond organ, electric piano, tone generator.  The additional musicians are also among the Canterbury luminaries and include Jimmy Hastings (flute, soparano and tenor saxophone); Mont Campbell (French horn); Lindsay Cooper (oboe and bassoon); Tim Hodgkinson (clarinet), and finally the Northettes (Barbara Gaskin, Amanda Parsons, and Ann Rosenthal).  All of the musicians are absolutely top shelf and the individual performances are breathtaking.  The ensemble work is also very intricate and there are some fairly dexterous meter shifts.  I feel that Richard Sinclair's vocals (and bass playing) are both excellent and it is always a treat to hear him perform whether with Caravan, Hatfield & the North, or Camel.  The nine tracks on the album are arranged into two largish suites, including tracks 1-8 and the massive 20'13 Mumps suite.  As I mentioned, although progressive rock is the dominant style, there is a good bit of jazz rock.  In fact, there may be slightly more jazz rock than was found on the 1974 debut.  There is also the whimsical Canterburian sense of humor - I think this is also a distinctive feature of the Canterbury ""thing"".  Greater emphasis is placed on instrumental sections and lengthy ""jams"" are scattered across the album, where Dave and Phil really get a chance to shine.  The Northettes also add a very nice, dreamy touch to each piece, and the woodwind playing, (especially Jimmy's flute work), heighten this effect.  There are also brief experimental sections too - the last few minutes of Fitter Stoke has a Bath is a good example of this.  Overall, although I don't feel that Rotter's Club is much different than the debut, some folks might notice a bit of more of a jazz rock approach.    The bonus tracks include alternate takes of Big John Wayne Socks Psychology on the Jaw and Chaos at the Greasy Spoon, in addition to the extremely jazzy track Halfway between Heaven and Earth, the thunderous (it is unbelievably heavy) Oh, Len's Nature!, and the once again very jazz-rocky Lying and Gracing (it sounds live but there is no indication of where it was recorded).  These last three tracks are superb.  All in all, this is an excellent Hatfield & the North album and is highly recommended along with the 1973 debut"
1,It's sad to see a band with this much talent play a bunch of poppish songs that sound like rejects from singer/songwriters or the Dixie Chicks. You'd really never know this was an Irish band. I'll be trying to unload this CD ASAP
2,Such a title should deserve better quality... Other CDs of Piazzolla are much better
5,"When I first heard Hatfield and The North back in -73, the music made a distinct impression on me. I love the sound of this band, with the easily recognizeable sound of the Northettes, arrangements Rhodes el-piano, solos with the Lowery organ (***** to Dave Stewart), the sleepy voice of Richard Sinclair and overall atmosphere. Great work, still after all these years I keep this band as one of my favorites..."
2,"The songs are poor, the recording quality is worse. For some reason no one can duplicate the sacd multichannel quality in Dire Straits or Allison Krause"
1,"I bought 4 of their cd's from amazon after hearing the song ""bad days"" in a batman movie. This cd is the worst of the 4 i bought. Not one good song. Totally lame. I'm not even going to stick someone else with it. I'm just going to throw it out"
2,"For me, the performance simply missed the mark. A capable choir should be able to stand forth and sing out without a surround of distracting instrumentation. Though the poor have already suffered enough, I promptly gave my copy of this CD to charity. For that I beg forgiveness"
2,"Technicaly this is an excellent performance, however the choice of selections is doleful and does not bring much Christmas cheer to the listener.  The earlier CD releases by Chanticlier were wonderful but this one misses the mark"
5,"The other reviewers said this was THE Coe record. I gotta say it is! If you want to hear saloon-singin', get this. You can almost taste the sour whiskey and smell the smoke while Dave Allen Coe hits his licks"
1,"I give this CD one star, not because it isn't good, but, because it is the same stuff they have already sold once. I am a big Blind Melon fan. I was fortunate to see them live 3 times and they were great, but, when you can download songs like Mother Earth, Whoa God, Tickled Pink, and Rebirth. I have to wonder why they would release an album that is all old stuff. The only people interested in this album would be melon fans. Evident by how poorly Nico did in sales, This is very disappointing, it seems they are broke and are trying to rip the true fans off. There is nothing new, so do yourself a favor and just bust out your old CD's and play them, don't buy this, unless you don't own the albums.  The surviving members should be ashamed of themselves"
1,"O.K. When I heard that Dave was going to remaster/re-release the Megadeth back catalog I got real excited. I still believe that this album is a true masterpiece, but when I bought the 2004 remaster/remixed version I was MORTIFIED!!!! What was Dave thinking when he decided to remix it. All it needed was to be beefed up just a little, but he went to great extremes to ruin it. I know Megadeth fans were pretty pissed about this, but the one thing I did remember is that the first time I heard Countdown... when it was release in 1992 it gave me chills........period! I have regrets about buying all the remasters at once.......BIG MISTAKE!!! So in closing I went back and found the original versions of So Far...So Good...So What!, Rust in Peace, and of course Countdown to Extinction, and yes Capitol Punishment...The Megadeth Years. I'm glad that I was able to locate them"
2,"To call this the Best of Fleetwood Mac is a little far-fetched--it does not include any of their hits and great songs from 1967-1974, forgetting the songwriting of Peter Green, Danny Kirwan, and Bob Welch..It is not a complete so called greatest hits without including the early era--the title should have read-Fleetwood Mac-the best of Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham.  I am not knocking this lineup and I love the songs but my favorite is Fleetwood Mac--the Blues--the Roots.  I suggest the Then Play On album to get a really good idea how Fleetwood Mac was before Stevie and Lindsay..  Also, do not forget Bob Welch and Mystery to Me album--another Gem!!!"
5,"To even begin to describe the music on this CD is difficult...it's like trying to describe what God looks like. Not only is the music just incredible, but the two female singers have to be the best two voices on the planet. Luker's Salve Regina had me in tears at the end (and I am getting all misty eyed just thinking about it now). Scott's singing is just remarkable. If Angels sing they sound like these two women. For heaven's sake just buy the CD!!"
1,"What's wrong with BHG? Besides everything? Is it possible for them to write more than one good song in their pathetic lives? My sister burned this CD from a friend, most likely because she likes the Bad Touch song, and I'VE been the one having to hear it in the morning when she's getting ready for school. It's pathetic. I don't know how much I can stress the word ""pathetic"", but it's the only way to fully describe it. Out of 18 tracks, there's one, count it, ONE good song, ""The Inevitable Return of The Great White Dope"", because it's nothing like their other songs. Everything else on this album is just like ""Fire Water Burn"", ""The Bad Touch"", ""Hell Yeah"", you get the picture. Palm-muted, droning, songs with extremely explicit lyrics, which is the only reason people will remember them. Isn't it about time to come out of the 13-16 year old stage? Having lyrics about sex won't get you any. Bands like Blink-182, Sum 41, and System of a Down have funny songs, but they have their limits. About the ""music"": 1)Palm-muting doesn't make a song good. I get it. You can palm-mute. So can most people who play guitar or bass. 2)Make your music more diverse and varied, or at least change your patterns. Elastica's self-titled album has 4-chord patterns, except they play faster, and the songs aren't much longer than two and a half minutes long (not that I'm comparing BHG to Elastica). 3)Do what you do ""best"", and don't try metal. ""Magna Cum Nada"" is BHG's horrible attempt to make something metal-ish. Stop. The problem with Bloodhound Gang is that they just won't die. People like them somehow, and so they feel compelled to squeeze out more and more crap that gets worse and worse as it progresses, not saying that they were ever good.  Why don't we go through the songs and rate them, shall we?  1. I Hope You Die: See track 15 2. The Inevitable Return of The Great White Dope: Best song by BHG, but still not great. 3. Mama's Boy: See track 15 4. Three Point One Four: See track 15 5. Mope: See track 15 6. Yummy Down On This: See track 15  Catch my drift yet? I don't think I can fully show my displeasure with words. ""1 star , because 0 is not an option"" is exactly correct.  People, if you actually want Bloodhound Gang, copy it from someone. Maybe if they see their record sales go down, they'll actually think about quitting.  p.s. Track 15 is called ""This is Stupid."
4,"Alan Silvestri does great work when writing for action films and this really shows his unique talents. The main theme for the volcano itself is a 6 note low brass motif used frequently throughout. Parts of the score are similar to Eraser in instrumentation and orchestrations. One thing I was not too impressed with was the sound recording. It is a decent recording, but the overall sound is low and you have to crank up the volume to really hear it good. The best cue of them all is the thrilling ""March of the Lava"" which includes all of the main elements of the score, with strong low brass rhythms, pulsating brass trills, ostinato strings, and driving, militaristic snare drums. ""Team Work"" and ""Build A Wall"" are also enjoyable tracks with snare drums and heavy brass, especially those trombone shrill sounds that Elliot Goldenthal has been known to use. ""Main Title"" is a suspenseful track that does not use the volcano theme, but instead uses a light 4 note theme that you never hear again. Some romantic, dramatic music appears in the final track ""Cleansing Rain"" to bring the score to a close. Overall, a great action score that serves both the film and your CD player well"
5,"Jimmie Rodgers had a wonderful, reedy tenor.  He was a first-rate singer.  The surprises here are the lesser known songs that are beauts, for example TLC Tender Love and Care, Child of Clay (which reminds me of Elvis's In the Ghetto), and especially the lush and soulful Wonderful You.  The last mentioned song is a real treat, absolutely delicious.  Three songs missing that I would like to have were his versions of Just a closer walk with thee, The Wreck of John B. and The World I used to know.  Hope someday Jimmie's A&amp;M releases will be out on CD too.  In the meantime, I recommend this collectio"
2,"I'm a big Sytx fan and have most of their studio albums so this collection isn't of interest to me.  But the omissions of Don't Let it End, Why Me and Love at First Sight prompted me to give this a poor rating.  I guess Anthology doesn't technically mean best of or greatest hits, but I hate when collections are put together and charting singles are left out.  I would recommend getting Greatest Hits and Greatest Hits Part 2 if you're just looking for a Styx collection"
4,"I've been a Linda Ronstadt fan for years, and must say this cd pretty well covers her bigger hits.  It doesn't quite cover all my favourites, but there's only so many songs they can fit on one cd.  Cheers, Hazel"
2,I like listening to George Michael as I personally feel he has a great voice but this album is not really for me. I like almost all of his music but I could have skipped this one and it would not have been a loss
1,"Well seeing all the reviews on here and being a former fan of sugar ray along with being bored to death at work I've decided to write my own review.  I believe sugar ray had something special with the first two albums as well but as time went by they have gradually gone from ultra-hip, I just wanna drink beer and cause trouble types, to oh so sappy songs about love and how heart break sucks, nothing that hasn't been told a thousand times over. When I first hearsd Sugar Ray back in 97 I thought their sound was revolutionary, I bought Floored and liked all the tracks and soon found myself buying the first album, then the third, fourth, and fifth albums came out, the third one was alright i bought it for the songs that weren't radio friendly such as Glory, Personal Space Invader, and Burning Dog; And with the release of their fourth album I bought it as well, hoping that they would get back on formula; Yes as you might of guessed i was delusional; their music had seemed to had gotten worse as predicted.....Now with the release of their fifth album, they had already lost me as a fan so therefore, I give all three of the most recent albums of theirs a 1/5 stars for lack of originality"
5,"If you are familiar with Greg Brown, you probably are familiar with this release. If you don't have it, get it and treat yourself to an experience that take you on a journey of loves lost and loves to come. For those who are curious about Greg's work, this is an excellent place to start. There is not a bad cut here, and in particular, &quot;Dream Cafe&quot;, &quot;Spring Wind&quot; and &quot;Laughing River&quot; are a trio of songs that somehow work some sort of magic into allowing me to see into life a bit deeper for a period of time. Two other releases that go along well with this are &quot;Further In&quot; and &quot;The Poet Game.&quot"
5,Great old standards and some new stuff thrown in from jolly ole England.  Wonderful selection and performance.  Great addition to holiday collection
2,"Okay, some of this is awesome: the ballads Ain't Gone 'n' Give Up on Love and Life Without You are the best; Change It is a great blues-rocker, and his guitar livens up even weaker material like Say What! and Come On, pt. 3. Still, this is a thin album overall. Lookin' Out the Window; Look at Little Sister; You'll Be Mine and Empty Arms are among Stevie's worst. Stick to the first two records instead, plus maybe In Step."
5,"Lisa Gerrard's music moves me in ways that no other singer/musician does. Being a DCD fan, I bought Mirror Pool & Duality the day they were released. (They are still my favories)  The Insider is a great movie. Some of the best work I have seen from Crowe & Pacino. Lisa captures the mood (much like she did with Gladiator) with her special unique voice & style.  Lisa's music has a powerful effect on me and makes me feel as if I am going through a re-birthing. The sadness & pain of letting go of the past coupled with the hope and anticipation of what is to come. The struggle & release cycles throughout her music but always leaves me feeling at peace. Meltdown at the end of this score fits perfectly. I love to meditate to Lisa's music and let her take me on a beautiful journey. Art at its finest"
4,"i have to admit Rifkin's version of the B Minor Mass, although shocked me a bit at first, managed to convert me to the one-singer-per-part theory. the point is that in Bach's sacred music human voices are used as instruments & usually pit against the instruments. so the chorus includes both the vocalists and the instrumentalists. with this in mind, Rifkin's theory works out fantastically in his musical directorship. the sounds are crisp, the balance between the vocalists and the ensemble is perfect. I got this CD after being convinced by the Mass in B Minor. Highly recommended"
5,"The debate over the performance of J.S. Bach's cantatas boils down to the  following: the evidence suggests that Bach only had one singer per part for  performances of his cantatas. Thus, any historically accurate performance  of these works will maintain the one-singer-per-part approach. At the same  time, however, there is additional evidence that Bach wanted more  performers. We are thus stuck with deciding whether Bach wrote for the  musical forces he had on hand (which seems logical enough) or whether he  composed for the performers he would like to have (which would seem silly,  if he knew there would not be enough musicians to realize his intentions.  On the other hand, Bach does make &quot;solo&quot; and &quot;tutti&quot;  distinctions in the score... draw your own conclusions).  Rifken is a  strong supporter of the one-performer-per-part approach, which may seem a  little sparse at first. Yet, when one listens to the various cantatas on  these disks, one must confess that these sound, well, beautiful. This may  not be an approach which would work for all of Bach's works, but the  effectiveness on these disks certainly lends the interpretation validity.  Regardless of where you fall-- and if you fall-- in the strenuous debates  over historical performance, I would heartily recommend this disk. Not only  are the performances polished, but the works themselves are exquisite-- a  wonderful sampling of Bach's cantatas. (Personally I am addicted to the  duet, &quot;Wir eilen mit schwachen, doch emsigen Schritten&quot; from BWV  74 which I could gladly listen to over and over-- listen to it and you will  see why."
2,"I think Beyonce has talent&is one of those Musical Acts with that Certain ""IT"",but at the same time her musical tendency's tend to be over the top. vocally she goes overboard&over things tend to  bring down her attempts at what she is trying to get to. this song is just part 2 of ""Crazy in Love"" which was a better track. this song sounds like it jacks Teena Marie's 'Square Biz"". bringing back Jay Z is a waste of time because his rap on here makes no sense whatsoever. her vocal runs are nice& the channeling of Tina Turner is cool in places,but  more records like this show while Beyonce has a pressence along with charisma&is a Foxxy mama,but making  another so-so track is not a good look at a career that could&Should be something special in time"
1,"...Or the other reviews.  Those reviews probably came from someone in their camp.  When I first saw these two, I said ""no they did not!""  If you go to a music  store it n the rap section and look through it, you will find knock-offs of known and real rappers.  These guys have their names for the simple reason of trying to confuse a would be buyer of Mobb Deep.  These two clowns are nothing more than sucker MC's trying to get a dollar off of someone else's hard earned names.  If you are new to hip-hop or just young, there IS a reason rappers used to talk about something called a sucker MC(a fake rapper, someone without skills, someone you hear and you know they should not be rapping) and these clowns are it"
5,"This is a great debut album from a very talented Canadian artist named Amanda Marshall. She's had big success in Canada, but not so much in the US. I don't understand why that is, and if you listen to this CD I think you'll agree with me. There was 6 big singles from this album, and even the non single tracks are awesome. The closing track ""Promises"" is stunning and raw in emotion. ""Let It Rain"" was the first single and it's definately a powerful song that resonates with listeners, a song about searching for redemption. ""Dark Horse"" was also a big hit. ""Birmingham"" is a great song about a woman in an abusive relationship who finally leaves her man. ""Fall From Grace"" and ""Beautiful Goodbye"" were also singles and other favorites of mine. I highly recommend checking this CD out if you haven't already"
2,"The orchestra was small and the instrumention poor.  Most of the pieces were short in comparison to the original movie scores, and tempos of some of the pieces were so different from the original movie scores that it made listening frustrating"
5,This is the most hilarious CD with a classical bent I have ever heard. Allen Sherman is gifted when it comes to imaginative uses of classical themes. Anyone who has heard any of these famous melodies will laugh themselves silly when they hear what is done to them! It's a super pick-me-up when I'm feeling blue. It's a must-hear for all you classical music buffs!
5,"Bowie's second instalment in the Berlin trilogy is a criminally underrated masterpiece, brimming with invention and vigour.  'Low' was most certainly an amazing achievement and an absolute treat to listen to, but unlike most, I feel that ""Heroes"" tops it in every regard.  The first side (like 'Low', containing the more conventional songs) has more urgency than the tracks on 'Low'. There is more energy and more depth to the song writing. Where 'Low' was fragments/ideas with magnificent textural framing, Heroes' first side shows really intricate song writing being beautifully combined with dense and innovative arrangements that take the clunky synth and electronic sounds of 'Low' and fuse them into a more sophisticated whole.  The lyrics are also much more intriguing. 'Low' was lyrically and vocally quite sparse, but on ""Heroes"", Bowie delivers some of his most compelling lyrics. Just couple of the fantastic snippets that pop up include:  'Your lips cut a smile on your face'  'There's slaughter in the air Protest on the wind Someone else inside me Someone could get skinned'  'Sons of the silent age... Don't walk, they just glide in and out of life They never die, they just go to sleep one day'  And of course we all know the gorgeous lyrics that the title track possesses. Not to mention Bowie's ultimate vocal performance on this track. In fact, the vocals on the ""Heroes"" album soar like on no other release of his. The songs climax and Bowie belts out some amazingly expressive and emotive performances. Overall, the first half of the record takes the best parts of `Low's' first half and 'Station to Station' and turns it into the most successful and engaging group of tracks that he has ever released.    The second half of the album sees Bowie reprising the ambient themes explored on 'Low' but once again this album outdoes its predecessor. The instrumental tracks on ""Heroes"" are even more evocative than those on 'Low'. Bowie and Eno once again strip away the clunky synth and electronic sounds and create more focused and more atmospheric pieces second time around.  Bowie feels like more of a presence on this album overall. Less detached, and not hiding away from himself as much. This is further displayed by the re-introduction of his sax playing on a number of tracks. He adds personality and flair to 'Sons of the Silent Age', provides one of many gorgeous melodic layers on 'V-2 Schneider' (which trumps both 'The Speed of Life' and 'A New Career In A New Town'), and his free-jazz styled, heavily treated playing on 'Neukoln' is oddly appealing. Bowie also plays the Japanese Koto on 'Moss Garden' giving a beautifully subtle and sensitive performance on what is a perfect ambient piece.  If you own 'Low', love it, and are wondering which album to get next... well I can't recommend ""Heroes"" highly enough. If you own 'Station to Station' and love it... ditto. If you have some of Bowie's other albums from some of his other periods and are curious about which of the more experimental albums to start with, this is the one. It's one of those albums that is experimental without compromising quality song writing. It takes the ideas first generated on 'Low' and expands and improves upon them, while introducing a highly unique and infinitely appealing aesthetic all of its own. It is also more timeless than 'Low'. It's sounds are still fresh and haven't dated a bit in the 30 years since its release.   It is not only the best of the Bowie and Eno collaborations (The Berlin Trilogy), it is also, in my opinion, the greatest achievement by this most amazing artist."
1,"The A1A Album includes ""God's Own Drunk"" and this is not included on the CD with the same title.  How did this happen?  We main purpose we purchased the CD for this song and it's not here"
1,"Lets get 1 fact out: IRON MAIDEN DOESNT CARE ANYMORE!!!  How can they be SO brilliant with # of the beast, Piece of Mind & PowerSlave & then put out 5 terrible records in a row starting with X-factor?  This record is soooo boring! I bought it based on Wickerman which I found to be OK, reminiscent of  the old Iron Maiden & then they just ran completely out of material. Track 2 on sounds exactly the same, long boring slow tunes that never end.. going track after track, album after album. Does ""Dream of Mirrors"" ever end? I cant ever tell.. I just lose my attention due to its such a GD drag. Then they hit me with ""Thin Line"" which is even less interesting than the most boring professor I had in the most boring class in my entire college career.   You cant listen to the original ""Iron Maiden"" release & then seriously listen to this new crap & release it, unless you just dont care. Obviously they dont CARE!! This record is TERRIBLE!  If they did care they would relisten to the first 6 or so & rethink thier efforts & either improve the sound or just end Iron Maiden & come out with a new band named ""Too old, too tired!"" & quit defiling the great name of ""IRON MAIDEN"""
4,"how can anyone write so many great songs? c'mon people, plunk down the forty-five stinking bucks and experience the unearthly genius of robert pollard. if you are already a fan, there is no excuse to NOT have this. as one might expect, this is not the starters place to look. bee thousand, alien lanes or the safer(more NORMAL sounding) isolation drills would be the best choices.   nice packaging, good booklet. excellent liner notes. pick your favorite 20 or 25 songs and make the ultimate GbV disc. what a joy the suitcase is."
1,"A Best of White Lion album? What are they selling blank CDs? Seriously, the 80's had great bands, but towards the end things were getting a little ridiculous. The final nail in the coffin for 80's rock was White Lion and Warrant. Nuff said"
2,"White Lion were just a rip off of Van Halen, except VH were better.  I can't believe some of these reviews, I have listened to this album intensely, the guitar player was copying Eddie VH not only on his tapping, but wangy bar and riff building.  The songs make you wanna heave, &quot;Little Fighter&quot;, &quot;when the Children Cry&quot; and &quot;Love don't come easy&quot;, this was just a sad attempt at trying to cash in with the glam rock chart material of the time, but they failed.  If this is the best of, then I'd hate to imagaine what the worst of sounds like, cause it must be diabolical"
1,"Buy this disc if you want to feel like someone stole your favorite toy, tagged it with profane sharpie writing, and then tried to sell it back to you as something new;  Gavin's version of we are the champions made me feel like stabbing myself in the eye with my pen;   Eleven's version of stone cold crazy made me feel like i was having a seriously horrible acid trip;   and breaking benjamin's version of who wants to live forever sounded like i had the vocals slowed down but the music was sped up;   good rock song + crappy artists = cringe worthy remakes that never should have been released;  this album is only getting 1 star because i dont think it will let me give it 0 and Constantines version of bohemian rhapsody is awesome! it the only song worth listening and you can probably download it some where or get it from your dumb friend who bought the disc and then relized it what a piece of crap...  "
5,"Only gay song here is Victim of a Criminal.  Everything else makes for a complete album with some real winners like Liquid Separation, Plasma Springs, Sex Offender, and This Faith.  In my opinion the essence of FLA lies in Gashed Senses & Crossfire, State of Mind and TNI, but Millennium is just a killer cd regardless of who put it out.  If you're new to FLA and this is the only one you have heard and you like the style then you might not like other FLA before this release.  I think they tried to evolve Millennium into later releases but failed.  Its one of those cd's so good it was probably an accident.  :"
5,"When I first heard this album back in 1994, I did not like it all. I was expecting Tactical Neural Implant part two. However, later on in life and with a much broader palate for music I must say that I love it. It was a stroke of genius to add the layer of guitars and I love the hard edged sound which sounds like a mix between Ministry, FLA, Die Krupps and even Front 242. The cover is a very odd thing that does not look like anything at all and the text is not all that great. The lyrics are interesting and they make up for the not so great vocals with plenty of energy and a tremendous tallent to make cross over music. The guitar layer is amazing and add a brutal edge to an already grimm sound. FLA show on this album that they can mix and match their sound and still be able to create amazing music."
1,"Perhaps I'm just getting old, and maybe I just have such a special place in my heart for Dionne's recordings from earlier in her career, but this recording just doesn't cut it.  I understand the necessity and the desire to ""update"" old hits from one's singing career to make them ""sing"" to a new generation of listeners, but there is an annoying sameness to each song.  The electronic instruments dominate way too much, particularly the percussion.  Where's an acoustic piano?  Not one horn?  Not even a small string section?  This must have been a pretty low budget project.  If you are a Dionne Warwick fan or are eager to listen to her music for the first time, first go back to her recordings from the 60's.  Then try some of her music from the ""Heartbreaker"" and ""Deja Vu"" period.  But don't waste your money on this one.  I hope Dionne's next project has a bit more imagination and better instrumental arrangements. "
5,"The guitar intro to RIPTIDE is worth the price of this CD alone.  Lou really shines on EGG CREAM, ADVENTURER, RIPTIDE, SET THE TWILIGHT REELING and FINISH LINE.  The only week song on this collection is HOOKY WOOKY.  I bought this CD in 2004 and I can't stop listening to it.....very groovy!"
5,"I am assuming if you are reading this, I don't really have to say anything technical about Mozart or these GREAT late string quartets. I am only writing this review to let you know... For anyone who is disappointed with the performance and sound quality of The Berg Quartet's EMI Mozart collection of these same quartets, this is a horse of a different color. Recorded in the early 90s for Teldec before the  Berg's signed with EMI, These performances are sublime.  You would not belive this is the same group that made those horrid EMI records. This is THE Bergs we all know and love and nobody before or since has made Mozart's string quartets sound this good. Perfect intonation, TONE, blend, dynamics and yes, PASSION. I've had many collections of these works and this leads the field. BY FAR. THIS ONE HAS IT ALL.... And the Teldec sound stage is the cleanest and crystal clear you'll ever hear. With wonderful front to back depth and air around every note. Demonstration sound with great imaging and transparency. You can ""literally"" step inside this recording. Well you know what I mean. It really doesn't get any better than this"
1,"I did not like this album one bit, or one song.  I had a hard time listening to it all the way through.  I certainly would never listen to it a second time.  Affected and pretentious.  Miss Fleming has a beautiful voice, but not here.  The songs that were not ugly to begin with, ended up that way.  So far I have ""standard"" albums from Kiri, Dawn, and now Renee, please ladies let's have no more of this, it doesn't work. "
4,"This release is a great one.  However it does not compare with the original ""Dear Diary, My Teenage Angst has a Bodycount""  It seem almost all of the tracks are filler tracks and the entire album must have been spit out at the last minute.  That being said the band From First To Last is still very talented both musicaly and lyricly. "
1,"What is this compilation have to do with anything?  These are a bunch of essential songs with a few remixes that are already on other CD's! GOLD?  Where in the hell is the platinum collection at?  I was hoping to fine more rare remixes from the artists listed on this CD, instead of nothing.  HIP-O records should be more focused than the efforts of this project.  What about the other Eric B & Rakim expanded projects (UNCUT, please,unlike the GOLD album they did for them...) Uptown Records Compilation re-release, Marley Marl's first jams on MCA... who's with me on this?  Even better, how about helping with BEP to stop selling out and making quality Hip Hop music again.  I suggest some real crate-diggers for the HIP-O staff in the future because this CD is a redicule of hip hop music, and they're not doing jackbone for r&b either!  I got one name for that: SWITCH's full-length albums on CD!  Hip-O and MCA/Geffen/Universal, if you're not going to at least make up you minds what name to use to lead the company, stop keeping the people waiting for quality products. I will not buy this so-called Hip Hop GOLD CD because it's junk! "
4,"This is a very fun album.  Of course ""Jukebox"" makes you want to dance no matter where you are. But if you only listen to the singles you are doing yourself a disfavor.  Bent Fabric has really crafted an album and you will be rewarded for listening to it front to back.  The only reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because the album is pretty short. Even with it being padded out with a few remixes (which are good and appreciated) this runs under 60 minutes. On the other hand its refreshing to just get the good stuff and not have to flip past padding tracks.  Don't get me wrong, this album is worth your money, especially if you are a fan of dance/DJ music. Very fun and a great party album you can throw on and leave play without worring about bad tracks ruining the vibe"
5,"I was looking for arrangements of many traditional Christmas carols done by orchestras.  This album hits the spot.  It is not uniquely orchestra carols, the Canadian Brass is mixed in as welll.  The highlight of the album for me is the back to back track of &quot;Sleigh Ride&quot; pieces.  It begins with W.A. Mozart's &quot;Sleigh Ride,&quot; followed by Leopold Mozart's piece of the same name, and then finnished with the ever popular arangement of &quot;Sleigh Ride&quot; by Anderson.  It is a really good mix of carols, and can be listened to for hours"
2,"I first heard word of the track &quot;Fly&quot; in a review of Arf! Arf! Records' &quot;A Heavy Dose of Lite Psych&quot; compilation in Mojo magazine. The reviewer vowed that this track was worth the price of admission by itself, everything else was bonus. I was intrigued by the description of &quot;what Radiohead may have sounded like in the Summer of Love&quot;. Receiving the compilation CD, I immediately listened to this track and completely fell in love with it. When I heard the album had been re-released, I jumped at the chance to buy it. I have to admit I set myself up for disappointment. The only other tracks that come close to comparing are &quot;Land of Sensations and Delights&quot; (little more than two minutes), &quot;Christine&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot;. None of these tracks can match &quot;Fly&quot;, however, and many of the others sound like Jay forgot to write the rest of the song (like the last track on side 1, &quot;Nobody&quot;, if I remember correctly). It's still interesting, but I would not rate it as five stars. I'm hoping I'm not misled with Aerovons and Gandalf (both of which I'm getting ready to buy, and comparisons to the Beatles and the Zombies are enjolling me to buy these)"
4,There might be 2 clunkers on this disc but most of it is quite enjoyable.  For power-pop fans that might enjoy Christmas tunes.  Not necessarily for Christmas fans that might enjoy power-pop.  4.5 stars
2,"MTV Unplugged 1 was a great album, that blended very well. Unplugged two just misses as a combination of songs"
1,I agree with others This CD has been very badly put together. The sound is harsh. I thought there was something wrong with my Hi-Fi. It is such a shame as we've been waiting so long and Jon's music is so brilliant. I don't know if anyone else has noticed too but the title track fades out too quickly.
1,"Well iv read through a few reviews now, some good, some totaly wierd and none understanding, some dont know what they'v even on about but i read the review by G FUNKINN which i think is 3rd down. im a huge tupac fan and will defend his reputation if anyone dare try portray him as something other then a true hip-hop legend.  i was realy looking forward to writing this review about this great album as it's easly one of my best if not my best, but i was so shocked to see some write such a detailed review on this album (someone love's this album as much as me) G FUNKINN you'v done a brilliant job on reviewing this album and made me want to buy another copy incase anything happened to the one iv got.. .. ..   i'd just like to add what the story line of the best song on the album ""tear drops and closed caskets""   the song is so well writen when listening to it your mind fallows the song and make you feel like your reading a book due to the way the songs writen, after its finished it makes you feel like after you have just watched a realy good film and you get that feeling inside that make you feel like what you'v just watch is actualy one of your own memories ( not mean that you have had happen to you what the songs lyrics are about but more that it's such a graphic song) the rhyming of the word is nearly unbelievable. you do tend to hear the same thing been rhymed alot in songs ie: im a G from CPT and other things that ryhme with G or E, but not in this song  the song start's by intruducing the 3 mean characters which are two friends called little moe and little trigga and a woman called little precious. it tells you how prcious is a getto girl and wont even bother with you unless you have a nice car and money, litle trigga's heart broken by the fact he's got no money and he want precious to be with him. so he meets up with his best friend little moe and plot to kill the two neibourgh hood deals and steal there drugs and money. they complete there mission and little trigga is seen as a big time man of the getto.  in the second vurse it goes on to tell you how precious and trigga are together and have a baby on the way but little known to trigga but his best friend lil moe has been seeing precious and it would apear that them two are togeher, after people see both precious and moe together start talking and trigga finds out.   3rd vurse goes on to say that now moe and trig are now enemys and precious is to doped up on drugs not to notice, the song ends with the lyrics. "" small time dealing to selling keys, i cant believe the sh** there telling me, they opened fire 3 bodys dropped so call the cops, precious little moe and trig, tear drops and closed caskets"".   the way the stories is told  is as if tupac and the outlaws are rapping to each other about the stories as if it happened and they had heard about it.      In the other views people have said that the outlawz have spoiled this album but i strongly disacree with these comment. the outlawz when i first heard this album i felt the same way and thought the outlawz maded this album not as good as it could of been but after a few years of owning the album you start too realise what the outlawz are saying, too the commen listener poeple do tend to get hook up in the beat and with tupac been on the album alot of people only start properly listening when pac starts speaking.      after owning the album for some time i started to notice the outlawz and although there lyrics can be spitted out in a fast and sometimes non-understandible style people dont actualy hear the words, if you do buy this album please dont just listen to pacs word but also listen to the outlawz because true listeners with a good ear for proper hiphop will notice the talent and lyricial skill of the outlawz and infact in a few song i find that they are very much on the same level as pac.  what more can i say. if you dont buy the album please down load the song tear dropz and close caskets  i actualy rate this 5 stars im not sure why it's only put a 1 star rating? ? ?  "
2,"Being an avid enthusiast of the drum n' bass &quot;scene,&quot; as pretentious as it occasionally sometimes is, in listening to this Cd I feel this is not a strong representation of the genre. This could very well be  personal, (so you headz chill) but this type of jazzy, tech-step like, a  cappella jam seems occasionally cheesy and filled  with..well...&quot;filler.&quot;  I realize that during 1998 this was where  it was at for Grooverider. He was hardly setting off bombs in the d n b  fabric with other producers overshadowing his less-than-fresh efforts.   This album has a few choice cuts, and his production skills are  commendable, but combining so-called jazz harmonies with this type of genre  is definately an abuse of power.  The loungy progressions are worn thick,  and lacking any true creativity deep down.  This album comes nowhere near  stuff on the &quot;Prototype Years&quot; ep which was showcasing the fine  talents of heavy hitters Dillinja, Ed Rush, Fierce, Lemon D, Optical, and  Boymerang, to name a few.  It goes without saying that Grooverider has been  one of the most respected and talented DJ's, probably getting all of these  afforementioned producers their starts.  A big name gets alot of support   and can get away unscathed by negativity due to that stardom.  No one would  dare defy that Grooverider's attempt at making d n b is off key, but let's  not give in to someone's production skills because they are graciously  empowered in the scene like a king.  Purveyor's of fine drum n' bass can  find sanctuary elsewhere.  Stick with your records for the best"
5,"Though I am not a fan of pop music, the beauty of Ofra Haza's voice lured me in.  This album has wonderful songs in an almost 80s-style pop music with ""middle eastern"" influence.  The lyrics are moving and deeper than typical pop music, complete with a voice that is unique to just about any genre"
1,"This doesn't include Rude Mood in either studio or live version, Travis Walk, Riviera Paradise, or any of his other unbelievable instrumental guitar workouts.  This compilation is a serious waste of money.  Virtually any album he put out would be better by itself than this compilation, especially Texas Flood or In Step.  Better yet by far, though, would be to get ""The Essential Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble.""  It's bargain priced, and contains every song you could want or expect, including the excellent, posthumously-released acoustic blues song, ""Life By The Drop.""  SRV is a guitarist worth discovering, but this compilation won't show you anything"
5,The interweaving of blues into Bach is incredible.  What is most gratifying is that Bach is very much present in this very smooth CD.  Highly recommend
4,"Keith Sweat made this lesser-known, underrated album with some of R&amp;Bs most beautiful songs like &quot;Why Me, Baby?&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Love You Down&quot;, &quot;There You Go&quot;, &quot;Give Me What I Want&quot;, &quot;The 10 Commandments of Love&quot; &amp; even the &quot;Keep it Comin&quot; remix. The first side of this tape is filled with fast songs &amp; one love song. The fast songs are terrible. At the same time, this album is better than &quot;I'll Give All My Love To You&quot;. Keith didn't get as good as his first album until his fifth album"
4,"This is a great comedy CD.  Sabes que I BARELY GOT IT.  I heard it was very funny, but it didn't interest me that much.  I finally bought it and thought it was very funny.  It is a must have from George Lopez's fans.  I can relate to many of the things he mentions, which makes everything even more hilarious. Recomended"
5,"THIS IS TRADITIONAL COUNTRY MUSIC AT ITS VERY BEST. THERE ARE GREAT FEMALE/MALE DUOS TODAY, BUT PORTER AND DOLLY CAN REALLY PUT ALL THE EMOTION THAT THE SONGS ON THIS CD REQUIRE. WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
4,"I must admit that I have never been a Boyzone fan and quite fankly I found Ronan's solo efforts rather dull, so when a friend lent me a copy of Boyzone member Stephen Gately's debut solo CD I was rather skeptical. I was pleasantly surprised. This CD is filled with wonderful pop sounds and Stephen's sweet singing voice is used to full effect here. With several tracks cowritten by Stephen himself, the lyrics are basically dealing with his coming-out. A wonderful CD - I throughly recommend it"
1,"When Britney Spear's first album came out called Oops! I Did It Again, I thought she had talent. But when My Perogative came out, I'm like, ""Where she at? That's sooo NOT BRITNEY SPEARS!!"" I couldn't believe it!! And her music videos from the CD, uggh!! I want da REAL Britney back!!!"
5,"After scoring their first number one album, The Heat Is On, The Isley Brothers' followed that classic up less than a year later with 1976's amazing Harvest For The World.  The band has always had something to say and never have they said more than on the amazing title track.  A call for understanding and unity, the song has more relevance today than it did twenty-five years ago.  The album is worth it for that song alone, but the rest of the album stands up as well with &quot;People Of Today&quot;, &quot;Let Me Down Easy&quot; and &quot;At Your Best (You Are Love)&quot; standing out.  The album peaked at number nine on the charts"
4,"Queensryche was never a band to sit still-- from their early metal roots on their first couple releases, the band began blending elements of progressive rock and other influences into their sound until ""Promised Land"".  In many ways a pinnacle acheivement in the band's history, it would have been extremely difficult to equal.  The album was well constructed, an acheivement of arranging and sound, and while it was unpopular with a number of the band's fans (who would have preferred a straight metal sound), it was certainly a unique statement.  Many bands would have been tempted to try for a sequel in sound and feel, others would have tried to get even more over the top, still even more would be likely to retreat backwards, to rejoin the metal sounds of their youth.  Queensryche did something quite different.  ""Hear in the Now Frontier"" is a stripped done, bare record.  Gone are the swirling arrangements, the extra instruments, keyboards, synths, samples, layered vocal harmonies, etc.  Instead, straightforward riffing, blistering leads, and a looseness bleed forth, as though the band had been listening to what the other locals in Seattle were doing.  When I first heard the record, I hated it (even as a fan of the grunge movement that in many ways inspired it), but there was enough decent material to keep me coming back to it.  These days I love it.  In truth, I think it represents guitarist Chris DeGarmo's waning interest in metal-- he exited the band shortly after and ended up playing guitar with Jerry Cantrell for a while, and his stamp is all over this-- 12 of the 13 cuts on the record were written or cowritten by him, and the best material (that which looks back as little as possible) was soley from his voice.  From opener ""Sign of the Times"", with its sludgy rhythm guitars and wobbly lead, its clear this is something different.  The best material on the record tends to be the less heavy work-- from the laid back ballad ""Some People Fly"" to swirling love song ""You"" to the brilliant and soporific ""Hero"".  DeGarmo even takes the mic from vocalist Geoff Tate on great love song ""All I Want"", and while some of the heavier and more abstract material also works well (""Saved"", the bizarre fan-favorite ""sp00L""), its really an album that excels in the midtempo pieces.  The remaster is further augmented with b-side ""Chasing Blue Sky"" (a relatively uninteresting piece) and three recordings from the MTV unplugged show several years beforehand-- ""Silent Lucidity"" and ""I Will Remember"" get decent readings, but its really ""The Killing Words"" that is noteworthy-- its a fantastic and delicate performance of a great song.  It doesn't sound like old Queensryche, but that's what I love about the band.  They'd reach higher heights, but there's an awful lot of great material on here that deserves listening.  Careful and patient listening will yield rewards"
1,Pink Floyd is my favorite group of all time and a few hours ago I heard the Scissor Sisters do a cover of Comforably Numb on Saturday Night Live. It was the worst song I have ever heard. The Scissor Sistors are walking on ground they should'nt be walking on. The song was so bad that it took me a minute to figure out they were accually playing Comfortably Numb. I hope the Scissor Sisters are happy because they made a mockery of one of the greatest rock songs of all time
2,"I can't believe the 5 star reviews this album gets.  (Well, it probably deserves it more than Yoko Ono and Syd Barrett's albums, which also get mostly 5 stars.)  ""Golden Years"" is an excellent track, one of Bowie's best (wa-wa-wa)..  The title track is pretty catchy too.  But the rest of it is just depressing, dull songs with little of the originality that marked his Hunky Dory/ Ziggy / Aladdin Sane era.  He just ran out of ideas I guess.  I can believe he doesn't remember making this album - he sounds detached and bored with it all.  I've never considered David Bowie a GREAT vocalist, it's a testament to the quality of his Ziggy-era songs that you don't notice his vocals are a bit thin and weak, and need lots of echo and studio effects to thicken them up.  And the songs on this album are more vehicles for an accomplished vocalist than a simple singer-songwriter.  I'll give him credit for improving his voice and learning good singing techniques - the vocals here are certainly more accomplished than those on his earlier albums.  But it's not enough to save this lot of songs.  I guess it all depends on what matters more to you, the quality of the song itself, or the vocalist's ability.  If you like the first, get Ziggy Stardust.  If the latter matters more, get this album."
2,If you were waiting for Ministry of Sound to ruin Hed Kandi well then here it is.  Thankfully I haven't brought this.  After hearing this compilation it is very clear that Hed Kandi is over.  The only CD that's any good is the 3rd one and that's cause it's full of Hed Kandi classic's which I've already herd a million times....  Don't waste your money.  If you've already brought any Ministry of Sound CD's this year then don't bother cause if you haven't grown sick of hearing the same tracks from the last year on radio then you will be after hearing this.  Reserve your listening time for something worth while.  Quality isn't a word I'd use to discribe this compilation at all..
2,Stick with the 2002 and 2003 CD's. This one lacks the kick of the others and the chosen songs don't flow well
5,"I find the music of Oscar Lopez in this CD to meet all my expectations and I would highly recommend this purchase to those seeking the music of an accoustical latino guitarist  This was my first selection by Oscar Lopez, but I have no doubt it will not be my last.  He is very talented and his music is very rewarding"
5,Attempting to construct a solid soundtrack to a movie is also detrimental to the success of the movie as all contributing artists must put forth their best work.  Babyface has written and or co-written this entire LP which he has also produced with a touch of emotion from a woman's perspective.  As all of the work consists of heavy hitters there isn't any room for change as each individually could be singles in their own rights.  More so relationship driven from heartache this has everything you may be looking for in an all woman release including pop and R&B
4,"A must for lovers of bluegrass guitar and banjo pickin' by three of America's greatest musicians. Some classic stuff and, thankfully, some pieces I'd never heard.  Very high quality recording.  Unfortunately, there's only 11 cuts and I could listen for hours"
5,"by far the best dieselboy cd yet.  the selection is really nice and the mixing is transparent.  if you like your music dark *and* jazzy, this is a perfect buy"
2,"This album shows sadly that Nancy has lost her pipes, albeit ever so slowly. She misses as many as she hits. The arrangements are good and the surrounding cast is excellent with Bob Mintzer, James Moody , Tom Scott and many others and the artwork is superb! She looks great in the photos, and maybe that's good enough reason to buy it. But the singing is poor and her choice of numbers isn't so great either. I suspect that if she would keep it light and moving along at a faster swing-type tempo, as say Sinatra did at the end, she would sound better. Still a very classy lady though. "
1,"I can't even begin to describe how much this band sucks.  Suffice it to say that you will probably enjoy this cd if you are a fan of talentless nu-metal bands like Staind and Taproot.  I bought this because I was trying to find a new band in the same vein as 90s crunch masters like Helmet and Quicksand, but I was severely disappointed.  This is a cd for people who like their music simplistic, plodding, one-dimensional, and repetitive.  Wonder what's next?--How about another song just as bad as the one that preceded it!  After the third song of lifeless droning, it just becomes annoying as the torment continues unabated.  I've listened to this cd several times in an attempt to understand what so many others like about it, but I've concluded that I won't be able to fully appreciate this band until I can learn to fall asleep and puke at the same time"
1,I suppose you will enjoy this if you really like Yo-Yo Ma at his most boring.  This is glorified elevator music and about as interesting
5,"I have had this videocassette for years and its so worn I'm so glad to finally get a CD!  Jewel's voice is beautiful and some of the classics like Joy to the World and O Little Town of Bethlehem are the best versions I have ever heard.  I could have done without the non-traditional songs which don't quite fit into the holiday arrangement or match the beauty of her voice but its well worth the purchase for Gloria, O Holy Night and Ave Maria. If you like to sing along, I highly recommend it."
2,before you buy this poor cd you have to buy cathedral-&quot;forest of equilibrium&quot; and winter -&quot;into darkness&quot; which are what this band is trying to be .be wise .smoke a lot.know what good music is
5,This is better than the album by far. All the mixes keep you craving their best song
1,"Puddle of Mudd exploded into the contemporary pop/rock scene around 2000.  This album is representative of their entire catalogue.  For those music fans who want to hear true hard rock, pick up a good copy of any early Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath.  For anyone wanting true grunge, pick up any copy of an Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, or Nirvana album.  Puddle of Mudd shamelessly (and inaccurately) self-promotes their band/sound as both hard-rock and grunge, while living up to neither.  Since most of their fans seem to be pretty young, they've been able to pull this sham off, mainly because their audience has never been exposed to any of the aforementioned bands...and honestly has no desire to listen to any older music.  The songs on this album are extremely redundant, with little variation of riffs or overall aesthetics from one track to the next.  The lyrics are horribly compiled to offer nothing more than a vocal rhythm and subpar content.  This album is a waste of both time and money for anyone interested in listening to any worthwhile rock"
5,"The Flamingos are my all-time favorite group ever. Extraordinary harmonies, impeccable timing, and intricate arrangements characterize every beautiful recording by this amazing world-class group. The Flamingos have a unique and timeless sound which has often been emulated but never duplicated, and most likely never will.  They have left an enduring legacy of music for millions of people to enjoy. May God bless them all"
4,a good cd but if your looking for a god version of these songs you must! absolutly have to hear the studio versions on the other albums. but this is a must have for the hardcore fan
1,"yeah....this cd bit.  i bought chillout sessions 4 last year, and looked forward to buying this compilation as well.  unfortunately, it didn't live up to the last one.  out of the 20 or so tracks on the first cd, i liked 2-3...and they were all on other compilations i already own.  the same was true for the second cd.  this was not worth the money.  i was very disappointed"
2,"To the person that mentioned Jim Steinman's lack of involvement with the album, I agree. Without the genius' magic touch, Meat loaf has come out with an awfully shabby album. The title song ""Couldn't have said it betterr myself"" offers a slight zing to the album. But when listening to the rest of the album, it is very disappointing. Steinman and Meat Loaf are the ultimate duo. But when one is taken away, it is noticeable. I would not reccommend this album"
1,"If you want a greatest hits package from Reba McEntire, get her first or her second one.  This one contains mostly pop tripe from when she all but abandoned country music to ""do what sells"".  This collection is phony...just like the lady herself. "
2,"This sounds more like a &quot;country gospel quartet&quot; collection.  For a much better bluegrass collection, try Rounder's &quot;25 Years of Bluegrass.&quot;   Much better gospel bluegrass CD's are Ricky Skaggs' &quot;Soldier of the Cross&quot; and The Isaacs' &quot;Increase My Faith&quot; or &quot;Pieces of Our Past.&quot"
1,this little white janet jackson wannabe is a total sellout and trailer trash with nasly moans for a voice and stiff dancing. And yet 70 million losers bought her records
5,"What can I say?  Rachelle Ferrell, Miki Howard, Deniece Williams, and Me'lissa Morgan are excellent, but this woman is the master!! None of Anita Baker's albums will disappointment, but this, I think, is the best she has to offer.  More than so on this album doe the music complement one of the beautiful voices God has ever blessed anyone with.  My favorites are More Than You Know, Fairy Tales, and Lonely"
5,"This is an excellent debut from Mindy. Her voice is beautiful and each song on here is good. &quot;Guys do it all the time&quot; is a fun slap in the face for all those &quot;macho&quot; types out there, the title song is my favourite though, but all are good, from the love songs to the fun songs. I hope she stays true to her roots though, and doesn't go the way of Leann Rimes and Faith Hill. One thing I have never understood though, is why nearly all country cds are limited to 10 tracks. This one for example is only 35 minutes long. Rock and pop cds quite often exceed 12 songs but country albums rarely even exceed 10. Anyway, thats just an observation, and doesn't take away from the worth of this album. Recommended"
1,I have been waiting for this cd for a while and I must say it was a complete disapointment for me.I am a devoted fan and I must say this production is not even close to the previous cd's.The songs are too bland and the quality of the compositions is very poor and flat.Overall a bad cd
5,"Most artists or groups suffer the notorious sophmore flop. (1st Lp off the hook, second not even close) However, I felt like they've improved off their first release. Beatwise this is one of the most head-noddin albums they've dropped. Production was flawless. Lyrics seem to have improved as well. Go cop this and support quality hip hop music. A+"
2,This is a compilation of many different styles;  look Yo-Yo can play bluegrass!  Not really &quot;Classic&quot; Yo-Yo
1,THIS BAND HAS IS ASSOCIATED WITH SUNNCOMM.  Sunncomm protects the content on a cd so it cannot be copied.  DO NOT SUPPORT BANDS THAT SUPPORT UNLAWFUL SURVILLVEILLANCE
1,"I made fun of my best friend so badly when he bought it. Honestly, I gave it a chance. We opened it and listened to it for the first time together. But halfway through the worst remix ever crafted by man, it was clear, that I would be making fun of him for his poor purchasing decision, for months to come. This is the worst remix every created. It is long and drawn out and has no merit or quality to it. Don't fool yourself into buying something you will never listen to and will hide from your friends"
5,"It is not always wise to revisit old loves, because nostalgia can be treacherous.  But not this time.  As an adolescent in the 60s, I, like many of my peers, fell in love with Dusty Springfield.  Forty years later, I listened to this collection, and I am in love with her all over again, only more so.  Her voice was very special.  From the country-style folk of The Springfields, through the romantic standards, to soulful R&B, she could do it all, and all exquisitely.  There are nuances to her singing and a depth of emotion to her voice that I missed first time round.  Listen to the unique phrasing on The Son of a Preacher Man, a song that she made her own, and the delicious seductiveness of Breakfast in Bed (which I heard for the first time on this CD) and you will see what I mean.  Her life had tragedy in it.  In many ways, the sixties were not as permissive as you might think and the British tabloid press were vicious when they caught the rumor that Dusty was a lesbian.  This helped destroy her UK career and after that she spent most of her time in the US and the Netherlands.  By nature insecure, she could not come to terms with her relative loss of celebrity and resorted to drug and alcohol abuse and even a suicide attempt.  Just when she was making a comeback following her collaboration with The Pet Shop Boys and an appearance on the Jools Holland TV show (what a hero that man is; when are we going to have his show highlights on DVD?) she was diagnosed with breast cancer, which ultimately killed her.  Among the divas of twentieth century British popular music, she is supreme, and was one of the very few to achieve real success in the US also.  It was good to hear The Look of Love on the Catch Me If You Can soundtrack.  It will help keep her voice alive for a new generation.  That track is on this CD and is just one gem among many.  They repay close listening. "
2,"From the live disc, Astronomy Domine is the strongest selection but is marred by a poor original recording and thoughtless transfer to disc.  The bass track is almost nonexistent robbing this song of its thunder. The other three tracks are good, not great, performances of what are perhaps their first important post-Syd Barret compositions.  They are definitely not the band they used to be. The studio disc is a mess.  The first part of David Gilmour's suite is the best bit, some nice blues guitar.  Like disc one, disc two sounds muddy. My overall impression is that the band was in the process of just starting to grow out of their psychedelic jam band britches but hadn't yet figured out what to put on next. Live disc=3 stars; Studio disc=1 star; Net rating=2 stars"
1,"I enjoy the band Cracker and have no issues with their releases. I just wanted to make a note to potential buyers, if you are buying used DO NOT use the Amazon seller doolicity. I have ordered from them several times and EVERY SINGLE TIME they come in as THE SLOWEST of all sellers!!! I won't endorse who I think is good but I just left the 10th negative feedback for doolicity and hope I can save many frustration when buying CD's from artist"
5,"I bought this Cd without ever having listened to a single note of the band's work.  I had read a review in Sound and Vision, then the views here at Amazon, and I took a chance.  I was not disappointed.  Every song here is an absolute gem.  The harmonies are magical, and the instrumentation will transport you.  I play this disk again and again, and I think my wife is going to hide the CD if I play it at dinnertime once more.  I promise you will not be disappointed.  Buy this disk, and simply enjoy; it's magic, gorgeous, and worth any price"
5,"Clear, sweet voices are the main attraction of this CD, with well-chosen male guests to sing those songs best delivered in a masculine voice, like &quot;Bonny Blue-Eyed Nancy&quot; and &quot;Queen of Connemara.&quot;  The selections range from lively reels and jigs and the tongue-twisting (well, maybe not if you're Celtic) &quot;An Poc Ar Buile&quot; to the haunting &quot;Broom of the Cowdenknowes,&quot; &quot;Down by the Glenside,&quot; and my favorite, &quot;Erin Gra Mo Chroi.&quot;  This is another new-to-me group that I plan to collect more of"
1,"There is no song worse to me than ""Everybody Loves Somebody Sometime"" and that one dud spoiled it for me.  I hate that song so much.    The others are okay, but this one dud - that is the one song I never want to hear nor would I ever inflict it on anybody.  It's heinous."
5,"I alway knew that Dean was a great camidian, but I wanted to find a collection of his greatest hits in song. I found it here on this disc. Dean had a great voice. No wonder the olive garden plays him so much in the background. I can even see why Regis Philbin plays him constantly in his office. This is a great disc to listen to. I did not grow up listening to this music, but over the last few years the music grew on m"
4,I do not have many Kenny Loggins CD's. I bought the &quot;Essentials&quot; CD's and then found out about this one.  I am really enjoying this CD.  The songs &quot;fit&quot; into my playlists whether I am playing only Kenny Loggins music or playing other Artists as well.  It is always good when I can mesh the music with my mood.  So far I have been able to pull out this CD and find something that matched.  I would have liked a few more songs
5,"linda rondstat has shown us once again what real popular music is all about. the songs on this cd have great melodies, lyrics, & production value. thanks linda. we who appreciate the standards owe you a large debt of gratitude"
4,"If you are a true Alanis fan, the first rule is you must own everything she has done. Second is you must love everything she has done! This is a must for any collection to enjoy for years to come"
4,"Audio Disc Breakdown:  1. FEAR OF BLISS - Some trippy rock from Alanis! This track doesn't follow Alanis' standard songwriting formula and is a bit scattered. Nonetheless, a great song. 4/5  2. BENT FOR YOU - Excellent alt/rock effort. This is the song that opens the DVD portion of ""Feast On Scraps"". Excellent. 5/5  3. SORRY TO MYSELF - This is a spine tingling ballad. Perhaps, dare I say, Alanis' best ballad. This song definitely should have been released as a single. 5/5  4. SISTER BLISTER - This one's a monster rocker! As well as the previous track, this would have been so successful as a single. Not since ""You Oughta Know"" has Alanis produced such a great rock track. Would have been a huge hit on the Modern Rock Charts. 5/5  5. OFFER - Another ballad here, however, this one falls incredibly short. While Alanis' voice is good, nothing seems to come together and the lyrics and music are to say the least, boring. 2/5  6. UNPRODIGAL DAUGHTER - Another great rock track. It's about Alanis leaving home for L.A. to start her new life. We see a hint of the ""angry"" Alanis we say on ""Jagged Little Pill"", maybe because this song is referring back to that time. 5/5  7. SIMPLE TOGETHER - I believe this song was the song sent to radio stations to promote ""Feast On Scraps"". It most definitely was a poor choice. While it is an ok ballad, it's somewhat dull. 3/5  8. PURGATORYING - This song is magical! It's a very enjoyable and definitely interesting song. There's almost an otherworldly feel to this. From watching this song being performed on the DVD of ""Feast On Scraps"", it's easy to see the magic of this track comes from the live performance. Nonetheless, great! 4/5  9. HANDS CLEAN(ACOUSTIC) - It's really nice to hear this 2002 hit stripped down to the core. Sounds great. 4/5  DVD Overview:  The full concert on this DVD follows Alanis though her 2002 ""Toward Our Union Mended Tour"" Most of the footage is from her Rotterdam show. It's loaded with hits, precious rarities and brand new tracks! Alanis has such raw, pure energy in her shows. Most notibly on tracks such as ""Purgatorying"", ""You Oughta Know"", ""Flinch"", ""Sympathetic Character"" and ""Uninvited"". This DVD shows us at times the rewarding and struggling process of songwriting in and out of the studio. Contains superb behind the scenes footage showing us Alanis' humorous and wacky side. It's also an excellent facet to understand her and her philosophy to a much greatest extent. 5/5  Overall:   I actually rate this album 4.2 out of 5 stars. ""Feast On Scraps"" is a great experience for any lover of live music! A great buy!"
5,"I believe this was one of their strongest and smoothest CD's they ever put out. Fourplay is one of Smooth Jazz's best supergroups. I have worn out this CD along with ""Elixir"", which is the next best one in my opinion. ""Yes, Please"" was the last CD before ""Heartfelt"". Although Heartfelt was good, it seemed like they are going in a different direction. I just previewed ""Journey"" and I have to say that i most likely won't be buying the CD, I'll just buy certain songs. If you want the definitive Fourplay collection, get every one of their CD's from the self titled debut to Yes, Please. You might even pick up ""Heartfelt"". If you want one of their best CD's, get ""Yes, Please""!!"
5,"First of all, I am not a classical critic, and second of all, I have heard a lot of music in my time and this set takes the cake for the best of class. This music of Samuel Barber preformed by the New Choir of Oxford College exemplifies the title of this CD, Having not purchased the CD and just listening to the sample tracks available, I am sure I have not experienced it all. But, I urge you to buy this CD and to listen to it in it's fullest extent"
5,"Jeff Golub and his crew have got a relaxed and polished style- in the light jazz vein of say Bob James or the &quot;Crusaders&quot; They move from funky tunes, thru  soulful ballads and on to rousing infectious  uptempo grooves. This is really enjoyable instrumental work, familar but  never hackneyed. The musicianship is exemplary, tight and inspired  throughout. I'd put this disc in my top ten of the past three years- highly  reccomended"
1,Mambo #5 caught my ear when listening to the car radio.  It is the only passable song on the CD.  I couldn't even listen all the way through the others.  Just awful.  I paid one cent plus shipping for it used and still feel ripped off by Mr. Bega.
2,"""Things Falling Apart"" is the remix album that followed ""The Fragile"", and is remixes of material from that record.  After the high standard set by ""Further Down the Spiral"", I had lofty expectations, and that could be effecting my opinion of this one, I largely found that this album falls short of its predecessor in all ways.  It could be the choice of material-- largely sticking to the song forms, I think the remixers missed an opportunity to really place with something atmospheric and create something unique-- I mean, did we really need three versions of ""Starf***ers, Inc""?  I find the original to be subpar, and remixing a weak song isn't going to produce a strong one, regardless of the efforts Sherwood, Oglivie, and Clouser put into their remixes.  Ditto for Hillibrandt's take on ""The Wretched""-- its not one of the stronger pieces on the record.  And where's the remixes of ""We're In This Together"" or instrumentals like ""Just Like You Imagined"" or ""Complication""?  This material has a depth and detail to it that suggest it could well receive a remix.  Now mind you, its not all bad on here, Reznor and Moulder's reconstruction, ""The Great Collapse"" (pulling in samples from at least a couple songs and layering them on top of a good beat) is very listenable, Benelli's remix of ""The Frail"" as a string piece may surpass the original in terms of delicate beauty, and the cover of Gary Numan's ""Metal"" is fantastic.  But overall, this is somewhat of a weak effort"
5,This is an excellent CD!  I honestly can't listen to the CD enough.  I've had friends listen to the CD who aren't even interested in any sort of Celtic or instrumental music and they also raved over it.  McGoldrick needs to put out another one
5,"This is an excellent CD with the wonderful music of Rampal's flute and Laskine's harp, a perfect and unique match. Whereas the CD contains many beautiful works, there are three that are sublime and deserve mention.   ""Nambu Ushioi Uta"" a Japanese folksong is a unique work as the sad willow melody is pierced by sharp flute interruptions, like an obstinate sparrow continually breaking the silence of melancholy. The piece tip-toes like an elegant silk veil floating on a branch over a night garden.  With its broken pacing, the melodies remain sad and reflective, but always interrupted by the pesty bird chirp, like a crocus on a dark mid-winter morning.  ""Defune"", a mature echoing ghosty melody builds a sad journey of experience and time. I would listen to this song over and over, allowing it to release any grief that I harbored. There is a lilting passage that builds and allows the harp to mirror or reflect the building lilting passage established by the flute. Then the piece moves toward a resolution of quite contemplation.  The CD ends with ""Sakura Sakura"" which Rampal and Laskine play for all it is worth, starting with a minimal slow paced introduction of the melody which is no sooner established than is rendered with a pastoral interpretation of the classic tune. And as the flute wavers like a songbird, a triump of music begins to build and anchors the central presentation of the work.  Now having established and adorned this rich tapestry, Rampal and Laskine begin pulling every golden and silver thread from this whole cloth to integrate minimal repetitions of the central melody finally offered to us in atonal windstorms and durges, retaining its uncanny beauty, made even more beautiful by the lack of perfection, the final sour note.   This CD is superb in that it balances the 3 tragic pieces I describe above with 8 other works of more gaity and light. I predict that this will be one of your favorite CDs for years to come"
2,well lets be real here there are two really catchy songs and they stand out.Don't Let Me be the one &amp; of course one of the baddest and rarest Bass Jams from the 80's I Can't Wait.cuz the Synths took over at will and  sadly the music hasn't recovered
5,"I cannot state more emphatically that Sunset Rubdowns album is my pick for album of the year, not just for how surprisingly good it is to anyone that enjoyed Wolf Parade's incredible debut but because it is simply inspiring from start to finish.  As a whole this is the most delightful kind of album, the one you wish everyone's side-band would put out to keep the enthusiasm going. The fact that it will remain under almost everyone's radar is not entirely bad, as it leaves it open for discovery many, many years down the road"
1,"I have never been drunk enough to listen to this all the way through, but I have made everybody hit the door, even when there was liquor left, by putting on ""Muskrat Love.""  Perfect for the thrifty college guy that wants to keep a few beers for tomorrow, or has already hooked up for the evening and wants the dorm room to himself"
4,"To begin with, whatever else one might say about this album, it has to be acknowledged that the import price for this disc, considering that it is only 32 minutes long, makes it a somewhat overpriced EP.  Meanwhile, this somewhat forgotten quasi-gem from Alice sits comfortably between the New Wave / post-Hollywood production of ""Flush the Fashion"" and his most strongly novelty-influenced album, ""Zipper Catches Skin"".  Generally, there's a stripped down sensibility musically, and less purely goofy lyrics.  Partly, this is due to the opening ""Who Do You Think We Are,"" which presents a rather oblique look, perhaps, at special forces.  The music is very stripped down--no, extremely stripped down compared to ""Welcome to my Nightmare"" or ""Goes to Hell"" or all of his later metal albums--it's as if Alice is getting in touch with his inner garage here.  Vocally, Alice provides his usual range of dark sneers, wide-eyed irony, and generally witty lyrics.  Certainly a promising start.  ""Seven & Seven Is"" (a cover) rattles along continuously with a snare drum, with jangly distortion guitars, occasional electronic flourishes, and Alice pretty much resorting to straight-up growly voice throughout. Hard though not to like an energetic song that declares, ""Oom Beh Beh Oom Beh Beh yea.""  ""Prettiest Cop on the Block,"" as the name suggests is a transvestite policeman tale.  Definitely shot through with machismo, this is no limp-wristed rendition.  ""I got a stiff reputation with a stick like a rock. My kids are confused, and my wife is in shock."" The vocals are the growls as previously--the I've-been-drinking-and-smoking-too-much gravel kind of voice.  The music is a bit uninspired, particularly the drums. The novelty of the song wears out in fairly short order.  ""Don't Talk Old to Me"" manages to vary things musically, finally. A fairly deft combination of kind of heavy-handed guitar and lyrics set next to a chorus that features keyboards and a number of layered dialoguing vocal lines.  The lyrics, of course, have a certain cleverness as an adult obviously complains about being told to give up all his toys, such as guns and cars.  There are more musical details and variation in this song than the previous ones--the particular combination of comedy and seriousness here is pretty convincing.  ""Generation Landslide `81"" is a reprise of the lyrically excellent tune from ""Billion Dollar Babies"" (the tune, in fact, that gives us the phrase ""billion dollar babies""). A military-march style snare kicks along, as simple guitar chords back up Alice's cultural rant, and adds a verse or two to the original.  One of the effects of this song is to point out some of the less inspired aspects of the rest of the disc, but that doesn't mean one isn't glad for it being here. Energetic, socially incisive Alice.  ""You Want It, You Got It"" let's out Alice's inner used car salesman, as he vocally sleazes his way through this either brilliant send up of the worst of New Wave music, or a rather unfortunate example of it. Cheesy keyboards and ham-fisted drum machine, many years later this song sounds so dated that it almost ceases to be dated.  If this song really tickles your fancy, then ""Zipper Catches Skin"" will be a treasure trove for you as this is definitely a prequel of that album to come.  Harmless cheese, one may not expect ""cute"" from Alice, but here you are.  ""You Look Good in Rags"" returns to a more traditional rock ensemble, guitar lead and all. This workaday rocker never really quite stands up, even with the semi-barbershop acapella section of ""rags rag rags"" toward the end, clipping scissors effect and all.  The non-stellarness of it does not mean that it's hopelessly boring. It's kind of good, harmless fun--it's just, one doesn't expect this sort of thing from Alice.  ""You're a Movie"" is a ridiculous cheeky monologue by a would be heroic general type. The music is thoroughly 80s, guitar tone and gacky keyboards all.  And, in fact, the chorus that chants, ""You're a movie"" is completely dead and unspirited. So what makes this pure novelty song ever-fresh, ever-delightful and really very funny are Alice's intercut remarks.  They say that in comedy timing is everything, and Alice shows that he's got it in spades here.  Technically a pretty awful song, one cannot help digging the wily wit Alice puts out.  The last track, ""Vicious Rumours"" provides that obligatory Alice song about public perception. The vocals here draw out the snideness more. One wishes (throughout the album) that the drums were set back more in the mix, and the guitars brought forward, but there's more energy in this particular rocker than most of the rest of the album.  So, overall one can hardly recommend this album without qualifications, especially if you are getting here by way of his first band, or by his later work, like ""Brutal Planet"".  As a kind of essay in cheese, and sheer low-fi production goofiness--and particularly of a sound that is glued immovably to the 80s--then you might enjoy this. Again, the import price is awfully steep for such a short disc.  A used copy seems a better way to go."
4,"HOME & AWAY: Norrisman has been around for quite a while, basically since the mid-nineties - enough time to put out a couple of albums as well as several bucketloads of singles - but never really made waves away from Jamaican shores until last year's appropriately titled HOME & AWAY. Ray Stephens' easy listening FLAMES rhythm provided the backdrop for this passionate, pleading love song (as well as Richie Spice's super EARTH ALERT, and Morgan Heritage's lush IN A GHETTO), which met with respectable international success, and now heads up this latest long player from the UK's Greensleeves label. Greensleeves are obviously giving the artist a well-deserved push here, with glossy packaging and great liner photos featuring Norrisman trodding the train yards with a guitar strapped across his back like a Jamaican Woody Guthrie, or something. It's a classy package for sure, and without a doubt, it's a classy record too. The familiar title track leads off, and is matched and even bettered by great cuts like SEH DEM BAD, I'M A FREE MAN, the ganja lover's HERBS TO YOUR NERVE, and the bubbling ARMAGEDDON ON. The reliable Lutan Fyah (another recent Greensleeves mover with his excellent PHANTOM WAR album) shows up for the decent combination tune, AFTER ALL, but other than that, it's all Norrisman all the way, and to his credit, he carries it off without so much as a misstep. Most of the production credit goes to Byron Murray and his In The Streetz outfit, and the backup is bright and lively throughout, with a very tangible - and very welcome -  old school one-drop vibe. The only real detour is the Delly Ranks-produced MOVE HARD on the RED BULL & GUINNESS rhythm, which just shows that Norrisman is as comfortable up at the edge of the bump as he is with the roots and lovers material. HOME & AWAY is a very strong release, and along with PHANTOM WAR, one of the best rootswise long players of the year so far.   Next up on the roots release schedule is Mr. Perfect's debut, GIDDIMANI. Look out for this one - it could be another contender!"
5,"I WENT ON MY LUNCH BREAK TO THE LOCAL RADIO STORE AS I USUALLY DO TO PURCHASE MUSIC.  I HAD BEEN MEANING TO REPLACE MY OTHER SHIRLEY MURDOCK CD'S THAT UNGRATEFUL PEOPLE REFUSED TO RETURN, BUT WHEN I SAW THE GREATEST HITS CD, I SNATCHED IT QUICK, FAST, AND IN A HURRY!!!!  IT HAD EVERYTHING!!!!!  WHEN I HEARD ""GO ON WITHOUT YOU, I WAS AT WORK, AND THE ONLY THING STOPPING ME FROM LETTING MY CO-WORKERS SAMPLE MY VOICE WAS THE FACT THAT I NEED MY MONEY!!!!!  MY EYES FILLED WITH TEARS BECAUSE MUSIC JUST DOESNT GET ANY BETTER THAN WHAT THAT SISTA DID TO ME AT THAT MOMENT!!!  I LOVE IT AND I CANT WAIT FOR THAT DRIVE HOME SO I CAN LET ALL OF HOUSTON HEAR IT.  IF YOU COLLECT OLD SCHOOL MUSIC---THIS ONE IS A MUST HAVE!!!!!!!  HOW BOUT' THAT!!!!!"
1,"It is tough to appreciate the spirit and enthusiasm that these tunes usually convey. Good song selection, but it sounds like this was recorded by a 30 piece high school band in their band room. I highly recommend going directly to your favorite college web site and purchasing their own arrangement and recording. No band can play any other school's song with the same emotion given to their own fight song"
2,"Looking at the liner photos makes clear that Falkner is the prettiest thing this side of N Sync (and doesn't he know it, especially in the shot of him being served what appears to be a large dose of Johnnie Walker Black by a leggy Bunny Flight Attendant).  Which raises the question: is this the recond a boy band member would turn out if he got the idea he was an ARTIST?  Not to put too fine an edge on it, let's say bluntly that this is a vanity project by a middling talent.  Falkner does everything on the CD and my reaction is so what?  His voice is mediocre; his lyrics are banal (&quot;Life can be just like a painting full of wonderful strangeness&quot;) or precious (&quot;Suspended on this stage of grace I have to remember this sound&quot;); the layers of sound he tracks down are just that -- layers of sound, with a disspiriting sameness song after song.  Give him two stars simply because he CAN do all the stuff on the record, but this guy needs to become a whole lot less full of himself and to spend a year or two listening to, say, Chrissie Hynde and John Hiatt CDs.  We'll let him come back then and try to write and play some adult love songs"
1,"I thought the music was dull, the lyrics uninteresting. The only song that made me want to listen to twice was the Daisy Prince piece.  The Liza Minelli song was painful"
1,"I bought this through Amazon for my older daughter when it first came out.  She tired of it after a year.  Currently, it is one of the dog's frisbee's"
2,"""The Day the World Went Away"" was the leadoff single from ""The Fragile"" and is of minimal value to all but collectors.  Two of the tracks on this are taken straight from ""The Fragile"" (with small adjustments, one's slightly shorter, one has some pointless crowd noise dubbed in), with the third (a remix) also being available on part two of the ""We're In This Together"" singles.  But looking at the songs themselves-- ""The Day The World Went Away"" is fantastic-- bleak, moody, with a great loud-soft interplay, a superb almost lacadaisical and very matter-of-fact vocal from Reznor, and a fantastic wordless vocal at the end.  The quiet mix is worthwhile, with a chant at the beginning and a delicate intro before moving the majority of the piece to a piano, in many ways it works better than the album mix, but its a bit overlong.  I'm thinking if the intro was trimmed it would work much better, the subtle reprise of the chant works nicely at the end of the piece.  ""Starf***ers, Inc"" is a rather popular song amongst fans, but I've always found it to be a bit dull-- the verses are nice enough, with a great beat, and there's some interesting guitar work on the piece, but the chorus is pure schlock and the lyrics are borderline embarassing.  Material aside, unless you're a completionist, you can skip this one"
2,The SACD recording of Derek and the Domino's Layla is a disappointment to say the least.  I have recently begun listening to several SACD and DVD-Audio recordings and this sound mix offers nothing new to the previous recordings.  This is one of rock's best offerings and the sound on this SACD offers no improvement to the mix of Eric Clapton and Duane Allman's guitar work.  A major letdown.
5,"I won't leave a long review but I felt I had to write something in support of this album. As you all know, the millineum brought some pretty bad music with it. The 1990's brought the best music in my life time when alternative hit the scene. I was born in 65.  I don't understand how the junk most stations play even gets on the airwaves. In a world that's pumping out cr@p music. It's good to see an artist giving me hope that the industry isn't totaly going down the toilet. A quick rundown: -Best song is #8  -Excellent songs are 1,4,6,9,10,11,12,13 -Song #2 and #5 are still ok -Songs 3,5,7 are just average. Overall the album has excellent flow, ie. the hit songs aren't the first on the album.  -Rivals NIN's Downward Spiral. Without a doubt the best or second best NIN album.  I hope NIN will continue. We need to purchase albums like this to show Trent R. that we appreciate his work. PS. Keep a look out for the new TOOL CD out in a few days. I've heard it(don't ask) and it is their best ever! A must buy. -R"
1,"This CD does not have the original artists performing the songs, which is all that really needs to be said about this CD.  I normally would have listened to cuts from the CD, but I don't have a sound card at work and  made the mistake of ordering it without listening to it.  Still, you  shouldn't have to read between the lines in the description to find out if  a CD with popular songs are being sung the way you like to hear it"
1,"peeps, if you want a good ministry album, try amazon.CO.UK!!  The club scene is MUCH bigger there and has the best DJ's in the world and so .co.uk has a much bigger choice of dance albums!  Check it out"
4,"YOU'RE NO GOOD,the #1 smash from this album is probably what made the album a #1 smash. There was only one other Top 20 hit,a cover of the Everly Brothers' WHEN WILL I BE LOVED. YNG came to the attention of Van Halen around 1978 and the band decided to cover the tune. The other songs are good. Linda Ronstadt's Asylum Records labelmate Andrew Gold plays guitar and sings background on YNG."
5,"I love this cd.  I watched the concert and was blown away.  There are very few things to complain about when listening to this cd.  I wish they had put the tracks on the cd in the order they appeared in the concert.  I also wish they could've done something with correcting the pitch on the Destiny's Child tracks.  It was painful to watch them doing it when the concert aired and it's worse listening to it while trying to drive. This cd is worth what you pay for it.  Where else could you get Billy Joel, Elton John, James Taylor, John Mellencamp, Paul McCartney and The Who on one cd"
5,"Syd Barrett's first solo album is very different from his work with pink floyd.It is much more haunting and sad than the whimsical ""The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn"",yet it still contains psychedelic elements. The lyrics are poignant, meaningful,and haunting.""Late Night"" ""Dark Globe""  ""Long Gone"" and ""Terrapin"" all have beutiful instrumentation and haunting lyrics.On ""No Good Trying"" and ""No Mans Land"",Barrett's madness comes through ,but in a way that adds an excellent tinge of psychedelica.""Golden Hair"" is a beutiful setting of a poem,while ""Octopus"" is a fun , invigorating, whimsical, and intriquing song.Not all is good though, it features the horrible songs ""Feel"" ""If I'ts In You"" and ""She Took A Long Cold Look"". They fall apart and they are out of tune.These hardly matter though,and this  is an excellent album with many things you woudn't expect from a crazy,drug addicted man"
2,"The Curse disc is perfect, I will say that but The Gift can be used for the following things, other than listening purposes... 1. Frisby 2. Mirror 3. Toilet paper 4. Shooting target 5. Tras"
5,"Andy C is the best DNB Dj in the land, and this mix confirms it. This mix is insane. The best tracks on the cd are Bandwagon Blues and my all-time favorite track HOTNESS. Andy C mixes so smoothly and vividly. And for most of you who have yet to hear Andy C's next Drum and Bass Arena CD; you're in for a treat. It far surpasses Nightlife. So, if you loved Nightlife, you'll be blown away by his next Drum and Bass Arena mix...Keep Ya Heads Rocki"
5,"Of the three Beatles Anthology volumes, this first one is easily the most exciting for Beatles fans and collectors.  The idea here is to give a new spin to the old classics, and present alternate takes, working versions, live renditions, all of which are being released here for the first time.    This volume takes fans back to the very beginning, to 1958's ""That'll Be The Day.""  What a thrill.  Then we hear home demos that were recorded in Paul's garage.  This is followed by the material recorded in Hamburg with Tony Sheridan.  We are treated to five selections from the Beatles' Decca Audition.  Even if it wasn't the greatest tape the Beatles could've made, I'm sure Decca is stil kicking themselves now for not signing the Beatles!    It gets better and better as time goes by.  The Beatles sang ""I'll Get You"" at the London Palladium in 1963, and ""All My Loving"" on Ed Sullivan in 1964.  Both of those recordings are presented here.  Other highlights include:  *One After 909 - I actually prefer this version to the one that got released in 1970. *Eight Days a Week - the tight harmony at the beginning works well.  Also the false starts were interesting. *How Do You Do It - the unreleased single. *Free As A Bird - a new Beatles masterpiece.  Die-hard Beatles fans will not be disappointed with this set!"
5,"This is a great Broadway soundtrack.  Mandy Patinkin has an amazing voice, and the singing is amazing.  Don't bother with the pathetic movie version"
1,"Crescent reminds me of how great a period of supreme artistry that Coltrane sustained during the last few years of his life.  I feel a need to inform all fellow lovers of this period of a little known album,currently out of print, called ""Infinity"" that truely ranks with his best. It was rescued from the vaults back in 1972 by Alice Coltrane who added a string arrangement which truely lends a mysterious quality and produces probably the most unique Coltrane recording of all time.  I first heard this album as a teenager and its mystic tones were a religious experence for me. There is something about the music that speaks of a man who knows he is near physical death and is searching for a path to eternal life.  Please note that I accidently gave ""Cresent"" a one star rating - I meant to give it five stars. "
1,"On April 26, 2005, this collection was re-released as part of the Universal Music Gold collection, at a much lower price (in Canada, anyway).  The material and mastering are fantastic, worthy of 5 stars, but the price, when compared to Gold, made me give the Anthology just one star"
2,"compared to their first 4 albums, this was a huge dissapointment, there are a few ok songs but overall it is very bland.."
2,"""BRUTAL PLANET""  REVIEW:   In Alice Cooper's long and successful career (admittedly with ups and downs along the way), he has proved (to me at least) that he is one of the best lyricist in rock and roll history. Albums like ""Love It To Death,"" ""Killer,"" ""Billion Dollar Babies,"" and ""Welcome To My Nightmare"" are just simply put - BRILLIANT. Alice was at the top of his game in the 70's. However, that is not to suggest that he's never released worthy material since then. In fact the quite opposite. Albums like his 1983 hidden gem ""Dada,"" 1991's ""Hey Stoopid"" and the brilliant ""The Last Temptation"" (1994) is amongst some of Alice's best work.  However, in the summer of 2000, Alice unleashed BRUTAL PLANET, which was produced by Bob Marlette (Union - ""The Blue Room"") and executive produced by the great Bob Ezrin. While there are standout tracks like the title track, ""Sanctuary,"" and ""Take It Like A Woman"" --- the album just falls flat. The new musical direction (Nu-Metal) seems too forced which is truly unfortunate because the album boasts some of the best lyrics Alice has ever written.   MUSICIANS:  Ryan Roxie ... Guitars Phil X ... Guitars China ... Guitars Bob Marlette ... Bass Eric Singer ... Drums  INTERESTING FACTS:  1. Released by Spitfire Records, ""Brutal"" Planet"" peaked at #193 on the Billboard Top 200.  2. There was a Japanese/Australian bonus track called ""Can't Sleep, Clowns Will Eat Me"". That title was actually inspired by dialogue spoken in the hit animated show ""The Simpsons"".  3. The stage show - which can be seen on the ""Brutally Live"" DVD - is a post-apocalyptic landscape of wreckage that also features the Frankenstein machine, a Guillotine, two TV`s - and in some cases - three TV's showing weird video footage all through out the show.   PACKAGING:  The album cover - which was created by Kane Roberts' company PlanetFX - is a decent and once again, the booklet does feature  the album's lyrics.  APPROX. RUNNING TIME:  48 min. and 4 sec.  FINAL ANALYSIS:  Musically the album just plods along and is devoid of any real energy. Despite being lyrically well-written, ""Brutal Planet"" is certainly the most disappointing release from Alice since his 1989 album, ""Trash"". **1/2 out of 5.     "
5,"I love this cd. Whenever we started to watch Nashville Star 2, I saw Brad and heard him sing, and I have liked him since then. I bought his cd yesterday, and I love all the songs on there except one. But other than that, it's a good cd. I love the song I Miss Me, when I heard him on Nashville Star singing that while he was playing the piano, I loved that song. But to anyone that kind of likes country music with a little bit of rock or pop or whatever, you will like this."
1,"In the early 1970's Rolling Stone magazine did a piece on Roy Buchanan, the late, and great, guitarist. Roy once turned down an offer to play with the Stones. Ry Cooder was nearby, overheard the interview, and began a rant about the Stones and Mick Jagger in particular. Ry was quoted saying, as I recall, that, though Keith didn't attend the ""Jamming With Edward"" session, the tape was rolling. (If memory serves, Ry said that Keith left the session, supposedly, according to Ry, in order NOT to appear to be riff hunting.)   Ry said the Stones ""stole"" his sound and riffs. He said ""Honky Tonk Woman"" was an example of this ""ripoff."" In my opinion the signature guitar riff of this tune is definitely Ry's style.  Ry also was disdainful of Mick's so called ""devil"" persona. He thought it absurd that a twerp (my word but I think I'm accurately depicting Ry's attitude towards Mick) like Mick could be considered ""satanic.""  Later, when Ry's disgust became evident to Mick and he prepared to fly back to the states, Ry said Mick asked him what was wrong and did he want more money.   I think Ry wanted less BS from Mick and company. "
2,i must say kim has a good voice but to be honest the only songs i like are crazy in the night and dont fall in love with a dreamer. rest of music is very date
5,"I really like all of Kalmahs previous releases, but they seemed to be lacking in some way; like they were on the cusp of something great but just couldnt push it over the edge. Well now they have. This is the best Melodic Death CD I have ever heard! They simply took the best elements out of every band out there and forged them into something amazing. The synth are a not so in your face version of Children of Bodom, The lead guitar harmonies are a beautiful mixture of Dark Tranquilites fast stacato riffing mixed with the violence and melody of old in Flames. The softer parts alude to my personal favorite 'Insomnium'. This has been the only cd i have been listening to for several weeks now just because there is no reason to listen to anything else. Kalman has perfected the genre! All hail."
5,"Last month I went to drop my car at my mechanics and my radio was playing the Cover Girls-Greatest Hits. My mechanic said, ""LADY YOU GOT CLASS!!! WHERE DID YOU GET THAT CD? MY WIFE ONLY LISTENS TO BRITNEY SPEARS"". I love that CD so much! It takes me back when I was a teenager at New York going to Hearthrob's, The Tunnel, Emerald City, and the Paladium. Boy!Those were the great days! I also have the collection of the FREESTYLE-Megamix. Worth buying when you are a true freestyle freak, lol"
1,"I bought this cd because ""Superstreet"" rated it so well in their magazine.  The beats are continous and boring.  If he had any skillz he should have used them for more uptempo beats.  But everyone who rated this seemed to like it so at least he has some fans outthere.  My recommendation don't buy it unless you like slow boring not even close to melodic beats how one could even dance to this is an enigma to me.  In other words i'll never buy another cd with chris fortier's name on it ever again"
5,Allele = Top Notch nu-metal/hard rock.   Easily one of the best rock records this year along side Breaking Benjamin and Flyleaf.   Worth 10 bucks. BUY!
5,"I admit, I rediscovered Spandau Ballet after hearing the song ""Gold"" over and over while playing Grand Theft Auto-Vice City in 2003.  So I bought this CD recently.  It's a very complete Spandau collection for the casual fans.  Die hard fans may find a missing song they think should be included but the major hits--""Gold,"" ""True,"" ""Communication,"" ""Chant No. 1,"" are all here.  I'm not too much feeling the black and white cover, but the booklet and interior design make the set a very impressive ""best of"" collection"
5,"I looked for awhile to find a colllection that included almost all the songs I remembered from my younger days. This CD pretty well does that. I have heard a lot of imitators over the years, but no  one has come very  close to her great style and sound"
4,"This is the second volume of recordings of songs by writers signed to the Beatles Apple Music Publishing company. Though most of the artists contributing to the CD are pretty obscure with a very limited recorded material behind them, there are a few exceptions.   The Iveys, who later changed their name to Badfinger, are represented with four mod-inspired recordings quite unlike the material they originally released the group. Though all very much time-pieces quite interesting material, with Pete Ham's ""Black and White Rainbows"" as the strongest track.   George Alexander of Grapefruit wrote two songs for the CD; none of them recordings by Grapefruit, but both among the strongest recordings on the CD.   Songwriting team Gallagher and Lyle wrote four songs; three of them their own demos. Quite obvious that they were already at that time great songwriters. The Hollies sounding tracks ""Technicolour Dream"" and ""Ivy Unrehearsed"" are my favourites.   The obscure band ""The U No Who"" who later turned into ""Bachdenkel"", deliver some of the very best recordings to the CD. Quite amazing that Apple did not offer the band a contract. Their title-track ""An Apple a Day"" is a very catchy song; their music both melodic and complex. Their other two at least as strong.   All in all a fine collection of music from the 1968-69 psychedelic years in British pop-music."
5,"You can't deny the incredible horn riffs put forth by this album, they're simply amazing.  You'll get goosebumps listening to this album for the first time.  Although at times some of the songs can become tedious, it is still one of the best jazz albums out there"
5,Ideal for anyone who likes listening to the music of Micheal Bolton or who wishes to lay a trap for a Michael Bolton fan
5,"Hank Snow is great on this CD.  He and his band found rhythm that will make you want to get up and dance with this CD.  This is a ""Happy"" CD"
5,"I've been a Randy Newman fan ""ever since there WUZ no Randy Newman,"" and so picture my delight when my very own kids bought me this boxed bonanza for Christmas (so I wouldn't have to). Randy Newman on the stereo on Christmas morning is about as Newmanesque a way to disturb the warmth of home and hearth as you can imagine. At one time or another I've owned every Newman album ever recorded, so I needed this collection like another hole in the head, but I have to recommend it as much for the surprisingly revealing biographical data as for the song selections. There are surprises here for even an old Newman trivialist like myself, and it was a relief to read of Randy's hardships as well as successes, since the dark side of this dark soul has too often been danced around in past articles and interviews. We learn that Randy's father, Irving Newman, MD, was an overbearing and cantankerous coot not above slugging it out with perfect strangers on public highways. We learn that the distracting eye condition Randy was born with, and the failed surgical attempt to correct it, may have helped to mold not only Newman's unique world view, but his discomfort with public attention. Interviewers (myself included) have generally conceded that ""Randy Newman just can't look you in the eye,"" but then, why should he when he has such a gift for cutting straight to the heart with his nostalgic sentiments and shark-attack wit. Of the many selections in this package, my standouts are his 1962 demo Golden Gridiron Boy, a delight to hear at long last since throughout Newman's career it has appeared as nothing more than a musical history anecdote. Turns out it is a quite competent version of that idiotic pop sub-genre of the '50s and early '60s when unrequited love burned teenybopping hearts alive to the accompanyment of snickering female vocal backups. Then comes Jesus in the Summertime, the highly unlikely mock spirtual that has the distinction of having been so offensive to so many ears that a session musician actually walked out of the studio rather than play on it. Now THAT's chutzpah! Personally, I like it, and find nothing offensive about it, other than the fact that it has the name Jesus in the title. Finally, there's Laugh and Be Happy, an unfortunately incomplete demo that features Newman at his Tin-Pan-Alley best, with a catchy ragtime riff and a delightfully mocking lyric. This number is for my money one of the best tracks ever laid down by one of our most consistently rewarding, if challenging, singer-songwriters. Thanks for the memories, Randy!"
5,"It is so refreshing to have Glen back (and better than ever.) I am addicted to this CD.  ""Cleareyed"" and ""Finally Fading"" are in contastant rotation on my iTunes.  If you liked Toad the Wet Sprocket at all, you will not be disappointed"
4,"Two months before Billy Higgins' death, the drummer &amp; Charles Lloyd say their musical farewells with the tapes rolling (courtesy Lloyd's partner Dorothy Darr, who also made a film of proceedings).  They play sax/drums duets (Lloyd mostly on alto, in fitting homage to Ornette Coleman, though he also plays excellent Traneish tenor on three tracks); they perform exotic woodwind/percussion duets, with Lloyd on Tibetan oboe or flute; Higgins plays guimbri (the 3-stringed instrument used in Gnawa music), sings gently (&amp; rather dodgily) in a variety of languages, even plays a blues on the guitar or does a 1960sish paean to love called &quot;Take a Chance&quot;; Lloyd adds short meditations at the piano.  Some of these tracks don't mean much outside the context of this session--the piano solos get a bit too samey, &amp; there's too much voice'n'guitar (though the blues is rather nice).  Others are superb--the two long alto/drums duos (one on each disc) are great stuff, &amp; Lloyd's tenor pieces are also superb (there's a nice Traneish blues on disc 2).  The more exotic pieces are often quite ravishing.  I suppose that many listeners will for sentimental reasons like having all this stuff, the unalloyed good tracks as well as those that only acquire real significance in the face of Higgins' own personal tragedy.  I'm less sentimental when it comes to what goes on my stereo: I could have wished for a carefully selected single CD of the highlights, which would have been a genuinely outstanding disc.  Four stars as a compromise rating seems about right.  This isn't a disc for the casual listener, but for those willing to bear with a few qualitative dips &amp; peaks, it'll prove a rewarding release"
5,"Dave Douglas's music is touched by genius. He seems always to be ploughing his own furrow, playing the music he wants to play and with partners of his choice. His impeccable taste and unique compostional style come from a deep  understanding of jazz and contemporary music. This recording is probably my  pick, but all come highly recommended. His sidemen know how to listen, the  empathy is astonishing, it really is a joy to hear. I look forward to  catching him on tour in England this Spring"
5,"the word &quot;classic&quot;,in my opinion ,has been way over used in describing noted records.but if there ever was one,this is it!Janis' best and one of rock n'rolls best.the right songs,the right band and janis.timeless.full tilt boogie really took these songs where the (pretty lousy) big brother never could have.if janis had lived,the sky would've been the limit.her heart and soul in every song.a truly great work."
5,"One of my favorite albums (and all-time favorite album titles).  Enjoyable even if you are not a fan of country and western music.  Ray Charles performs these songs with his own unique style and sound (IMHO - most, if not all, of Ray's performances are superior to the originals)"
5,"Gid Tanner is a legendary old-time fiddler, so much so that old-time fans are frequently seen wearing t-shirts that say ""Gid is My Co-Pilot"".  The old-time style here is, to discerning ears, quite different than the more common ""Round Peak"" style, made most famous by fiddler Tommy Jarrell, and quite obviously different than, say, Ozark fiddling.  None of the styles are any better or worse, just different, and serious old-time fans will enjoy picking apart the nuances of styles.  More casual old-time fans will enjoy this record as well, though, for both the excellent repertoire and top-notch musicianship.  If you think O Brother Where Art Thou is the real deal, I suggest picking this up and having a listen"
5,This very fine cd - from County Records of Virginia - is superb! County have once again produced a well balanced selection from the archives and have presented it to the public for their delectation. I would recommend this item to all lovers of traditional American Country Music. Don't let it pass you by
4,"Zoot Sims never made a bad album, but he did make a great number that were merely very good. This one, however, is excellent. Sims, Peterson, and Pass all solo beautifully, and the bass and drum team of Mraz and Tate are  behind them every step of the way. The two standout tracks are 'I Got  Rhythm', where Sims follows an explosive Peterson solo with full-throated  honks and excursions into his beautiful upper register; and 'Embraceable  You', when Zoot proves that only Webster, Getz, and Hawkins can challenge  him for beauty of tone. That said, there isn't a bad track on this CD, and  it will give any Zoot fan -- any jazz fan -- a great deal of pleasure"
5,I love the way she sings and the gift of her voice touches me deep within my soul. She speaks my language
2,"I wish that the sound on the CD was anywhere close to ""Flowers of Evil"", if it had been I would have given it 5 stars.  The music is really great live Mountain - maybe the best I've heard, but the sound is terrible"
5,I was rather dissapointed by the awful review's of this CD. I love the band and consider all of there CD's to be the best one's in my collection. Ville Valo's lyrics just pull you into a different reality. The bands songs mixed with the Chris Isaak and Blue Oyster Cult's covers of Wicked Game and Don't Fear (The Reaper) make the CD better than imaginable. I don't care what the other reviews say I would consider this one of my favorite CD's.
1,"Italian music from St. Laurent, Quebec Canada? I guess that is what one would expect. Sounds like a bunch of French-Canadian college students trying to audition in a faux-Italian bar. It is pretty bad. I don't know how they get ""Gloria"" as an Italian favorite. If you want Italian cafe music, don't buy this one. A waste of mone"
2,"I love trance music, that style of dance music with fast, continuous beats and rich electronic sounds, and often sweet sounding vocals, usually female vocals.  So I thought I'd like this album.  Well, I do like it musically.  It's not great, but it's good trance music.  But the lyrics ruin the album for me.  Most of the songs exude a bitterness toward love relationships or a cynicism that love will never work out.  Here are lyrical samples from the CD:  ""Maybe you're better off without me."" ""I'm wide awake, it's time to make it on my own; the dream is over."" ""We wanted love to last forever, but something's missing...I can't find words to break your fall, when 'Goodbye' says it all."" ""It gets lonely, but I have no other choice...no one sees my dreams falling all apart...I've been blinded by your lies.  I never knew love could be so wrong."" ""Tell me why you can't feel the things I do...I made the same mistakes I know I'll make again...It meant nothing to you, you'll never understand, it meant nothing to you, the touch of my hand."" ""November's here again, raining down on me, I disappear again..."" ""It seems like every [scrub?] I see is trying to get it on with me, they think it impresses me, the way they act so foolishly...I don't care, I never liked you anyway...You're a total waste of time.""  If these lyrics fit your life, and you like trance music, you'll probably like this album.     I do like the remake of A-Ha's ""The Sun Always Shines On TV.""  It's not better than A-Ha's 8-minute remix version, but it's nice to hear an old favorite with a new flavor.  This album has three mixes of the song, none of them significantly different from the other.  I also like the instrumental track, ""Blown Away."" These tracks are enjoyable, and a couple others have pretty nice lyrics, but the album as a whole I find too depressing"
5,i've always loved Pete Tong and his essential mixes.  then came this movie about the days long gone.  movie was awesome and so is this album.  every song has it's value.  day and night
1,"I bought this CD, and it won't play in my car because of the copy protection.   So I returned it.  WaYn"
5,this is the best real punk band. they are hardcore.  ilove them and they can be compared with the casualties and the exploite
2,These songs take me back and are all top hits! It should be noted that the CD will not play in some players. Some copy protected thing I guess. It would be nice if Amazon would list the players that don't work with these CDs so we could make a better buying decision. 2 stars for the player problems. 5 stars fot the music
2,"I'm a big Judy Garland fan, but found this CD lacking.  Her voice didn't have that extra force she always puts into her songs.  Some of them sounded like a bad imitation or she recorded it in her sleep.  It says &quot;original soundtrack&quot;.  Maybe it needs to be re-mastered.  It certainly won't be my favorite"
5,"On the soundtrack to the movie STAYING ALIVE,the not-too-popular sequel to SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER,there are five original Bee Gees' compositions and recordings(THE WOMAN IN YOU,I LOVE YOU TOO MUCH,BREAKOUT,LIFE GOES ON and SOMEONE BELONGING TO SOMEONE). We hear an edited version of STAYIN' ALIVE(only the movie title carries the G). The originally released 4 minute and 42 second version of the song is heard during the film's end credits when John Travolta struts through Times Square. The film was directed by Hollywood great Sylvester Stallone,and makes a very short cameo appearance in the opening credits. Sylvester's brother Frank,appeared in the film as Tony,a bandmate of Cynthia Rhodes who played one of Travolta's love interests. Frank performs FAR FROM OVER,MOODY GIRL and with Rhodes, NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP. Rhodes performs FINDING OUT THE HARD WAY solo. The almost unheard of Tommy Faragher performs LOOK OUT FOR NUMBER ONE and (WE DANCE)SO CLOSE TO THE FIRE. Released in 1983 as was another Bee Gees' production,Kenny Rogers' EYES THAT SEE IN THE DARK album"
1,"This recording is mediocre at best.  While the University of Miami Chorale is a fantastic choir, it should shy away from certain types of songs.  It doesn't have the broad range of sounds that the far better BYU Singers or Concordia Choir does.  'Water Night' is sung well, but not appropriately.  This song should be sung without vibrato or it destroys the effect of the setting.  The dissonaces that vibrato creates takes away from the beauty of the dissonances that Mr. Whitacre has written.  Unfortunately for the listener, vibrato is used in this recording and destroys nearly all of the beauty contained in this wonderful piece.  Aside from that, the rest of the CD is neither good nor bad.  Discerning listeners will hear the differences.  The music of Rene Clausen is treated well in this recording, but not understood completely by choir or conductor.   If you're looking for a recording of 'Water Night', unfortunately this is the only one on the mass market right now and sometimes beggars can't be choosers so buy at your own risk"
2,"When I was 15 and first discovering guitar, I loved this album. Listening to it now, it just sounds incredibly soulless and cheesy.Vai is technically very impressive, but the man can't write a decent song to save his life. Vai's modus operandi is to get a bunch of faceless studio musicians, lay down a generic rhythm track, and go wheedily wheedily wheedily whee for an entire album.  Technique on your instrument is never a bad thing, however, technique should be just a means to an end, not the end itself. And that's what no shred guitarist seems to understand. The fact that shred guitarists like Vai aren't more popular is due to one thing: they're more concerned about playing faster and more cleanly than the next guy rather than writing songs. There's a GOOD REASON why non-guitarists hate this stuff.  Basically, once you get past the ""Gee, that's neat"" factor, this album, and nearly all of Vai's music, feels incredibly stiff and lifeless.To be blunt, this is what John Tesh or Yanni would sound like if they played guitar rather than keyboards. Not only that, his guitar tone is absolutely awful. Very thin, high pitched, and brittle sounding.  The best thing on here is the blatant Van Halen rip-off ""The Audience is Listening"": the rest is just masturbation. Vai's best work has always been as a sideman, especially the stuff he did with David Lee Roth, because then he's forced to play actual SONGS, rather than 5 minute long, tedious guitar solos. On his own, he's just unbearable. I considered giving this one star, but I gave it 2 stars due to the fact that Vai CAN play, it's just WHAT he's playing that's the problem."
5,"Lately I've been getting into the harsher side of Industrial/EBM and Unter Null (aka Erica Dunham) is my latest obsession. I absolutely thrive off the pulsating dance beats and just love the brutality of her voice and words, which is really more like aggressive poetry rather than screaming incoherently - making 'Sacrament' - part 1 of a twin EP concept - more appealing and accessible with its melodic abrasiveness.  Track listing goes as follows:  1. Prophecy 2. This Is Your End 3. Watch You Die 4. Playing The Fool 5. Endtime (INURE mix) 6. Disgrace (unholy remix by ADAM) 7. This Is Your End (T3CHNOPHOBIA mix) 8. Prophecy (BLANK mix"
1,"I would have ordered this soundtrack except I actually took the time to check out the list of ""songs"" that were on it and to read a couple of the reviews.  Sure enough, it was exactly as I thought myself....there was only one song that I actually recognized from the movie itself, Gloria Gaynor's ""I Will Survive"", which is a good song, but not even close to all the other great songs which were in the movie itself, but NOT in the actual ""SOUNDTRACK""!  What's up with that???  Great movie, great songs, should have a great soundtrack that is available to the fans, but it does not.  Too bad.  I understand that the person who wrote the actual ""musical score"" for the movie wants his due, but the fans want ""their"" music, too.  Do the fans not have a right to what they actually expect on the soundtrack of a movie?"
5,"It's a tough call between this Red House offering and&quot;One More Goodnight Kiss&quot;, but this record remains my favorite Greg Brown album and one of my All-Time Favorites (mind you, most of Greg's albums appear on  that ATF list!). Each song takes you through the country, no matter wh'er  you live there or not. If you've ever sweated in a growing season or you've  walked a gravel road, this album's for you.."
5,"For all those who may not know, Kendall Payne was unjustifiably cut from Capitol several years ago and was out of the music scene for quite some time. She has recently re-emerged with a brilliant independent CD, appropriately titled GROWN. Check out KENDALLPAYNE.COM for details or buy it directly at CDBABY.com. This artist needs signed again and deserves worldwide exposure. GROWN is a very, very good album that without question exceeds what she brought out five years ago with Jordan's Sister. It's very well produced, very well written, very catchy and also very heartbreaking. She's got all she had on Jordan's Sister and more on the new CD, including a track that she did with Lifehouse's Jason Wade that has a very nice vibe and distinctly Lifehouse feel. Check it out, and send this artist back to the frontlines"
4,"Snoop Dogg is one of my favorite rappers. I've grown up listening to him since I was a child while he was rhyming on Dr. Dre's ""The Chronic"". I've even stuck by him when he put out bad albums (""The Game Is Sold..."") and when he dropped a decent album (""Paid The Cost...""). ""The Blue Carpet Treatment"" would probably be his best in over a decade if you ask me.  This album is full of laced beats and good rhymes. ""Think About It"" comes off real strong from Snoop laced with a dope beat. The radio hit ""Thats That..."" with R. Kelly gives listeners a nice R&B tune to listen to. As well as the other hit ""I Wanna Love You"" with Akon, another hit for this album.   As I said in my title, this is what ""Cali Iz Active"" should have sounded like. That CD was so horrible and failed to follow it's concept. This album followed what that concept should have been. Most of the guest appearances are form Cali. ""Candy"" would feature Goldie Loc, MC Eiht, E-40, and The Dogg Pound, and a real nice tune to ride to. ""LAX"" with Ice Cube is another standout tune that featured a sample from Biggie's ""Going Back To Cali"" in the hook. I'd say for some reason, my favorite song is toward the end with ""Imagine"" with Dr. Dre. and D'Angelo. Possibly because that piano laced throughout the song. Snoop would close the album with ""Conversations"" with Stevie Wonder, showing off that he's trying to get his mind right. Other guests include The Game, B-Real from Cypress Hill, George Clinton, and Kam (where the hell have YOU been Kam???).  Although this is a good CD I've heard from Snoop in a minute, it still has some rough parts. ""10 Lil' Crips"" sounded kinda weak to me. And I wasn't feeling the song ""Beatin' Up On Yo Pads"" although it's a positive song about him coaching and playing football, but it's a good song, so I'll make it my honorable mention track.  If you heard that this album was his most consistant since ""Doggystyle"", you heard correct. We're more than aware that he's not going to drop another one of those albums, but this is a real good one from Snoop. If other west coast artists drop albums like this, we might have the West Coast making a comeback. And being a fan of West Coast rap music, I am more than ready for it. If you thought Snoop fell off, well he gives doubters ""Tha Blue Carpet Treatment"".  Lyrics: A- Production: A- Guest Appearances: A- Musical Vibes: B Overall: A-  My Favorite Tracks From This Album: Think About It, Thats That..., Candy (Drippin' Like Water), Gangbangn 101, LAX, Which One Of You, I Wanna [Love] You, Psst!, Imagine, Converstions  Honorable Mention Track: Beatin' On Yo Pads  Peace Everyone!!"
5,"This collection of Sly and the Family Stone is simply THE BEST CUTS you can put on ONE CD! Sure,there are others like ""You got Me Smilin'(again)"" ""Family Affair"" ""If you Want me to Stay"" but you need more than one CD for that! These are the cuts that turned me on to this History changing music!!"
5,"Another vote for Boss Guitar for the best Wes Montgomery record of all time. These remastered series are limited, and the sound is so much better than the regular CD that you wont believe it. This is essential listening"

4,"If you're a big fan of that 'laidback '70s California pop-rock sound' (and who in the right mind isn't?), then the late Nicolette Larson's 1979 album ""In the Nick of Time"" is an album you should definitely have in your collection. This was Nicolette's follow up to her debut album, 1978's ""Nicolette"", and it's actually a better album, easing off of the sappy balladry & country/ western fluff that takes up a painful amount of space on ""Nicolette"" in favor of infectious, no-nonsense pop-rock.  Although ""In the Nick of Time"" is a bit on the short side and has a few less-than-great tracks, it's largely a splendid album.  Nicolette's fun, innocently sexy presence and her irresistible, husky vocals are on full display on a bunch of ultra-catchy tracks including a couple disco-flavored tunes with ""Dancin' Jones"" and ""Breaking Too Many Hearts"", the driving, riffy pop-rocker ""Just In the Nick of Time"", & ""Daddy"" which has a piano-and-vocal barroom-style prelude before kicking into that good ol' California sound.  Also great is the breezy, feel-good ballad ""Fallen"", & the somewhat bossa-nova-flavored ""Rio De Janeiro Blue"" (which is suspiciously, and strikingly, reminiscent of Steely Dan's ""Your Gold Teeth"", especially with that little lick that appears at 1:56 of the track). ""Back In My Arms Again"", a Motown cover, isn't exactly a great song in the first place, but it's given an agreeably energetic performance. The cover of Karla Bonoff's ""Isn't It Always Love"" is nicely done, though it's quite similar to Karla's own version & not as strong, & the album ends in limp fashion with the dorky Little Feat cover ""Trouble"" which is quite annoying. The biggest hit to come from the album was the duet with Michael McDonald ""Let Me Go, Love"" which is a splendid, soothing ballad.  As with the previous & subsequent albums, this one was produced by Ted Templeman, & it seems he & Nicolette were an ideal match. If all you have by Nicolette is her compilation CD ""The Very Best of Nicolette Larson"" on Rhino Records and you think it's all you need of her, think again--the only track from ""In the Nick of Time"" included on there is ""Let Me Go, Love"".  Originally released in October of 1979 on Warner Bros., a big thumbs up to Wounded Bird Records for reissuing this highly recommended album on CD in February of 2005--the sound quality on this version is phenomenal.  Wounded Bird commonly releases two-fers, i.e. CDs with two albums on 1 disc; it would have been perfectly logical to pair this album with her first album ""Nicolette""--they would EASILY fit on a single CD--but it's still a pleasure to see that they've been re-released, and hopefully these reissues will help to introduce new listeners and remind old listeners of the numerous gems these albums contain.  For any Nicolette fan, ""In the Nick of Time"" is unquestionably a must-have."
5,Yo its like Sean B. Dady said
2,This is one of the few remixes that left me hanging. There was no imagination. What's the point?
2,"Bob Dylan's work has been adapted to all kinds of musical styles, and you'd think reggae would be a perfect fit, since, like Dylan, it often fuses of the spiritual and the political and both Dylan and many reggae artists have a fondness for lush but not gooey romantic ballads (No Woman No Cry etc).  But this CD really doesn't work for me. I like my reggae rootsy (as far as I'm concerned, Lee Perry is God, or I guess Jah), and this sounds like slick, soulless beer commercial reggae, the kind of thing you'd probably hear at a resort pool party. Producer Doctor Dread has a very unfortunate fondness for smooth jazz sax, cocktail lounge guitar and sacharine flutes. It's all very professional, yes. These are some of the top studio musicians in Jamaica (Sly, Chinna) and they hit all the right notes. But they're just picking up a paycheck. After this session it sounds like they could well have laid down some tracks for a Jamaican Tourist Board spot.  Some of it is okay. Toots is always great, Apple Gabriel has a wonderful molasses-and-ganja voice, Michael Rose makes an interesting choice in The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carrol and Sizzla turns Subterannean Homesick Blues into a dancehall song, which works surprisingly well (and I don't like dancehall). The cover of Gotta Serve Somebody is pretty good too, partly because it was recorded separately from the rest of the CD so the backing music isn't so cold and efficient. You should probably just cherry-pick these from iTunes.  But even many of the good performances are sabotaged by that awful by-the-numbers studio sound."
2,"I've been a Merle Haggard fan all my life and this CD is about as great as he gets. But, if you want the original recordings of these hits, look elsewhere"
4,"In my opinion this is Snoop's second best album even today, behind you guessed it, Doggystyle.  That said it isn't even close to being as good as Doggystyle, but it is still a good album and after Da Game... and the slightly dissapointing Doggfather this can be viewed as a comeback almost.  Da Game.... featured No Limit production and loads of appearances by No Limit rappers, and as a result was wack, both have been cut back here.  Snoop must have put his foot down and asked to bring in his own producers for No Limit Top Dogg, including of course Dre, for the first time since Doggystyle.  There are also less No Limit rappers (any is too many though) featured, but surprisingly few appearances by his old West Coast homies.  Anyway best track is easily B*tch Please, which is a classic in any era, Snoop's verses are tight but Xzibit is really the star of this track, as he makes what was really his mainstream breakthrough.  My other top tracks are Buck Em, Just Dippin (both Dre produced unsuprisingly), Betta Days, Down 4 my Nig*az and Trust Me.  Snoop also displays his impressive storytelling abilities on Snoopafella, where he basically re-tells Cinderella from his perspective.  Most of the other tracks are at least good, and the production for the most part is tight, though the album is not without filler (Gangsta Ride, In Love With A Thug).  Overall this is an impressive album from Snoop, yes it is not Doggystyle, I don't think there ever will be another one.  People have the tendency to mark Snoop albums against Doggystyle, rather than on their own merit unfortunately though. I'd give it 4 stars, recommended"
1,"I can't even believe alkaline trio even let that be put on a cd, that is terrible"
1,"Sadly, one of the greatest rock songs of all time finds itself on one of the most boring rock albums of all time.  To add insult to injury, the notes on the CD cover proudly boast of 'a full eight months recording' time, which had been 'preceded by a year and a half of reflection and writing'.  We're talking 26 months here, surely time enough to produce a decent album.  Instead, they produced their only good song, which I'll say again, is an acknowledged classic, only hated by true Eagles fans, as most true fans hate the classics of their favourite bands.  If an unknown band had tried to get a record deal at that time on the basis of the rest of the filler, I seriously doubt they'd have been successful.  For good use of studio time see what can be done with just 30 HOURS of it on Led Zeppelin I"

2,"America was formed by Dan Peek, Dewey Bunnel and Gerry Beckley, three US military brats living in London. America generally sounds like either a third rate Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young or Barclay James Harvest (who were all ready a second rate Moody Blues) without any new ideas of their own. This 1975 compliation does however have the advantage of collecting all of their hits without wading through some of the painful filler on their individual albums"

5,"Wood / Water breakouts with a new maturity on this departure from the usual emo - core sound the band has cultivated over the years. A band that has been a cult favorite presents an unyielding indie - pop classic that begs to be listened to over and over. The old fan may be thrown for a loop at first listen but after several listens, the depth of the writing and complex arrangements become a staple of your CD player. Buy this CD"
1,"I ordered two copies of this CD, one for me and one for my daughter.  It will not play on my CD player, a Technics model.  We have never had anything like this happen before.  My spouse took the CD to a neighbor's home and was able to play it on his player.  On the strength of that, I gave my daughter her copy.  I have no idea whether she has tried to play it or not.  My guess is that she won't until next Christmas.  She is overworked and that won't be a high priority.  In case you are wondering, our CD player continues to work well, playing all our other CDs"
1,"I never write reviews for the cds I buy, but felt the need for this one.  NFG seemed to be maturing with Catalyst, but sadly went back to writing the same thing they always wrote.  I tried listening to the cd a lot to get hooked, but it's weaker than their self-titled.  They grew for the next two albums into something bigger and better, and then lost it all.  This album is super poppy, which is ok, but the lyrics are some of their worst.  I know some might disagree, and that's fine.  I just wanted to warn people, if you liked the direction they were going in catalyst, then you'll probably see this one as a step backwards.  Sorry NFG!  I still love you!  In a manly hitting each other sort of way"

5,"&quot;The Best of the Heartbeats&quot; is  a classic!  The romantic lyrics, the perfect harmony, and the wonderful lead singer, &quot;Shep&quot; all make this CD appealing to listeners of all ages and  tastes"
5,"Jimi Hendrix is arguably the all time Master of the Guitar.  He has yet to be outdone in spite of the decades since his passing.  While I enjoy the sort of Hendrix tunes played frequently on the radio, many songs just aren't heard unless one owns the album.  South Saturn Delta is one of my personal favorites.  If you enjoy First Rays of the New Rising Sun, or Axis: Bold as Love, any Hendrix fan would appreciate this collection as much if not more.  Play on Jimi"
4,"_In the Fishtank_ is an ongoing venture of an independent record company that allows the free exchange of musical ideas between (usually) two bands. Ultimately, the _Fishtank_ delivers exactly what it promises: a veritable fusion of the bands in question to create a sound that in itself is unique, but could also realistically (though far-fetched perhaps) fit in with any of the individual artists' other recordings. The bands involved with this volume of _Fishtank_ are Isis and Aereogramme, two bands that have some overlapping qualities, but aren't exactly the same by any means. This is the first and only _Fishtank_ volume I have heard as of yet, but it is apparently a great success on more than one level.  ""Low Tide"" starts with a tender, echoing melody that sprouts like an elaborately blooming plant. The reverberating music seems to lean more towards the style of Isis, but the singer of Aereogramme handles the vocals. My first impression was that the vocals sounded a bit like Maynard James Keenan's quivering falsetto. Just a bit. Well maybe a bit more than a bit. Either way, they sounded good. The track builds up with a pulsing bass line and industrial rhythm then calmly dissipates into the vast void of the sea. ""Delial"" gets off to a heavier start, and the hollow vocals of Isis' Turner become shrouded in a driving rhythm that evolves into an abrasive screech.  The third track, ""Stolen"" is more relaxed, with an extremely peaceful orchestration forming the bulk of the song, which trails off into an ambient mix of synths and natural sound effects.  The _Fishtank_ concept is a good idea, and it provides a bridge of discovery for fans of both bands involved. For having only two days to produce the songs, I'd say both bands did a great job. I would also say that both fanbases will enjoy this, and for the price, it is another good impulse buy if you're looking for something new. Actually, I recommend getting all three albums in the Isis/Aereogramme trilogy that I have reviewed, along with _In the Absense of Truth_ and _Seclusion_, and listening to them in succession with the _Fishtank_ in their midst. All else aside, this volume has prompted me to seek out the others"
4,coolio's latest album is alright but some of the songs just didn't make much sense
2,"Let me start off by saying that I am a fan of operatic metal. I love Therion, Theatre of Tragedy, Tristiana, Lacuna Coil, Nightwish, all of the bands that any self respecting music fan should listen to. However, I should have seen this one coming. I must say, witohut a frickin doubt, this is the cheesiest album that I have ever had the displeasure of listening to. I shelled out 15 bucks for this album and I wish that I saved my money and bought a knife and stabbed myself in the frickin eardrums, and then bought a bucket of sulfuric acid and drowned myself in it. The band overall has good musicianship, (and their singer is hot), yet they write sub par music with cheesy medieval themes. THe band has potential, and it might help if the f***in music video wasn't a sing along with the words at the bottom of the screen. Please, if you are considering purchasing this album, dont make the same mistake I did, and buy Therion's Lemuria/Sirius B. Trust me, you'll be glad you shelled out the extra 5 clams"
1,"I know you're excited, and you want everything to be perfect and planned down to the tiniest detail, and you're working on [probably] the biggest budget you've ever had to work with, but PLEASE save the $__.__ and buy yourself a new 8-hour lipstick instead. Then go to the library, and oogle over how many of these ridiculous CDs they have for you to listen to for free. Trust me, once you decide on your songs, you'll never listen to the CD again"

2,"Based on my affitnity for the blues/rck genre and the 5 star rating of Joe's playing I picked up the CD/DVD combo(Amazon) and was, I hate to admit it, dissappointed. Granted, he can play and has good chops, but for me, something was missing. Maybe that intangible. The fire that comes through  the amps. Not that his playing was not emotional or inspired form his point of view, but for me it was lacking. I need to watch it again to see if I feel the same way. Like the a previous two star reviewer, I would have enjoyed seeing this guy in a local bar or someone's basement and would walked away satisfied. But when you start playing with the big boys, this guy comes up short"
4,"This is the first Branford I heard (back in 1990) and I've heard a lot of him since.  I sometimes find his stuff hard to get into, but his sound is so pure and the music so honest and driving that I keep coming back to it.  Also, and this is definitely worth mentioning, his band is hot and Jeff &quot;Tain&quot; Watts is an astonishing drummer.  In any event, Contemporary Jazz, The Dark Keys, Bloomington, The Beautyful Ones, and especially the recent Footsteps of our Fathers are all quite stunning albums, but they require comfort with free and intense music.  If you already dig 60's Coltrane and Ornette, go for it.  If not, and you want to jump in and hear why people think Branford is so good, Crazy People Music is a great place to start.  You get the fiery intensity of the later albums, but the tracks are easier to digest and the melodicism of the themes (and the solos) is more accessible to those less familiar with his style.  I wouldn't start any earlier in his career, because you get his more &quot;bop&quot; influenced style, which he has evolved past (though he still has that sweet tone).  Trio Jeepy is another place to start, but I think it too, though a fine album, doesn't give a complete sense of his mature sound.  I gave this four stars, because it's not his most amazing work, but I do love it and have come back to it regularly over the last twelve years.  If this gets its hooks in you, you'll like the later albums; if this sounds overwhelming and, well, crazy, you'll probably find the later albums only more so"
4,"I've followed Harry for years and have always enjoyed his albums because each one has a slightly different sound from the rest.  This latest CD is light, has gentle compositions, and is also swingin' fun.  It puts me in the mood for dancing under the stars or curling up by the fire.  I think it's about time Harry did a CD like this"
2,"I remember listening to a radio station that was giving away as many records as you could name in 10 seconds.  The caller gets on and says, ""Chicago 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 etc.  I guess Hot Streets would have slowed the process.....Anyways Hot Streets is further document of Chicagos gradual descent into easy listening oblivion and oh what a dreadful place that is..."
5,"Listening to this brilliant series of tunes is like taking a long breath of fresh air.  It truly touches the soul. I bought the CD on &quot;spec&quot; after hearing a couple of tracks about 5 months ago. Smart  move!   Over time, it has become the A, number one listening choice for  almost everthing I do. There is true beauty and depth in each track.  It is  well worth the money spent.  I'm looking for anything else Luis and the UN  band might have recorded.  Don't hesitate. you won't be sorry"
2,"This recording of the new works by Theofanidis and Higdon is first rate. Great performances, and nice to hear along side the Copland, which stands out as the real masterpiece. Mind you, Theofanidis and Higdon are obviously really talented composers.  I like new music. I like beautiful music. And I don't usually mind if the new music I hear is beautiful or ugly, has a tune, or not. What matters is that I am pulled in, and not lulled in with cliches or pandering.  The Theofanidis seemed to be much more interesting  to listen to than the Higdon. His sense of orchestral color is very strong. But overall, their music is very pretty, and somewhat boring. Get this to hear that great Copland: it is the piece that on this CD that pulls you in to listen. I know this piece is not the new piece on the CD, but it really stands the test of time against the more recent works"
4,"MY feeling of Europe '72 is this: Love, love, love disc 1. Every song is performed with energy, great jams and one of my favorite Tennesse Jed's ever. Disc 2 on the other hand bores me a bit. Truckin' is great, but the Prelude&gt;Morning Dew is boring to me. But the bonus material (starting with a beautiful and etheral Looks like Rain) redeems it. So not a perfect live disc, no other official releases truly shows the creative live peak musically and songwriting-erly (is that a word?) the boys were in 1972, in the midst of their prime"
1,"Nothing hear, just the same aimless blabbing and complaining about how the streets currupted a young man. Whoa, if i could only make a song about my messed up childhood and make billions, I would be richer than these wannabe softees out int the hip hop scene."
5,My mom bought this years ago and I still think it's wonderful music for Christmas.  Definitely buy this album.
5,"This release by ""20th Century Masters"" is part two of their Loretta Lynn Greatest Hits compilation.  This one covers the second part of her career, and like Vol. 1, the sound and recordings are clear and original.  There are 12 songs here, beginning with ""Wine, Women, and Song"" and ""Fist City"", and ending with ""I Lie"".  In between, there is a duet with Conway, and the controversial ""The Pill"".  Yes, there could've been more songs included, or even more popular songs chosen instead of those provided here, but this is a solid offering that will not disappoint"
1,"After i heard the new Bone CD i had much faith in this new release from Layzie, although his previous efforts were all , very admittedly, bombs.  And unfortunately this new release was no change for Layzie Bone. It seems as if a Layzie with out the Thugs is not a good deal.. With no ""hardcore"" or ""Club Worthy"" songs , his CD lacks anything truly listenable...honestly, his lyrics don't even represent his talent on his solo releases...Will Somebody please tell Layzie to not release solo albums!! He is tarnishing his reputation as a rap artist!"
5,"This is one of the best albums of the last 25 years and certainly one of the best I have ever heard. If you like good music like the Beatles, Kinks, Rolling Stones, Wilco, Fountains of Wayne, Beck, Coldplay, Prince, or Radiohead, then you will probably not be disappointed by this CD"
2,"I'll probably never run out of music to discover. It seems that no matter how many stones I turn, no matter how exhaustive my search is, there will always be atleast a few gems I'd somehow overlooked. For me, XTC are one of those gems. I picked up Black Sea at the local record shop and it completely knocked me out. Maybe it was those huge drums, or the way everything felt like it was pulling apart at the seams. Regardless of what it was, I had to have more. Over the course of the next few weeks I proceeded to buy Drums and Wire followed by English settlement. Again, both were completely stellar albums, especially D & W.  Then there was Skylarking. It was supposed to be THE XTC album, their masterpiece. People compared it to the likes of Pet sounds and proclaimed it one of the best albums of all time. I'm sad to say it didn't live up to the hype for me. In fact, I find it to be downright mediocre. For me this is where they dropped the ball and failed to pick it back up. I'll admit that I miss the more raw, punk like energy that was found in early XTC, but that's not why I dislike this album. I actually enjoy alot of mellow, lavishly produced music, but Skylarking just sounds...bland. None of the songs seem to stand out and the production is borderline soft rock. Every time I listen I hear less of what made me love XTC in the first place and more of why I can't stand Phil Colins. Even the songwriting itself is weak, lacking strong hooks and any sort of weight to help the music rise out of the syrupy muck that Todd Rundgren laid out. I just don't see what all the fuss is about."
5,"""I get pulled over by the cops, I be so drunk I'd be out dancing to their lights thinking I made it to another club."" ""...Turn the music up!! Hey what is this - a leather bar? I am not into this you fags!""    Hicks delivers on stuff like this every second line. The Dangerous album is a riot. Get Hicks if you have never heard him. He is probably one of the best undiscovered comedy acts of the 20th century, died from cancer shortly after his peak"
5,"A brilliant work, and no this review isn't of much help really, but I'd like to forward a theory about the guitar solo in the prog rocker Roots of Coincidence: PM had been listening to Tribal Tech guitarist Scott Henderson in the mid 90's as Scott moved away from compositional jazz-fusion toward fearless, bluesy, attitude-driven free-form guitar, decided Scott was having way too much fun at it - and with songs like ""Canine"" on TT's Face First who could argue? - thusly deciding to stake his claim on this invigorating new ground. It's good, interesting, but fleeting and disjointed, and Scott does it better. Still, what PMG here, on Imaginary Day as elsewhere, are able to render as musical generalists, by selecting from the full pallette of sonic colors and using each to maximum effect, ah! This, the artistic specialists and the attitude-driven often by contrast find elusive"
5,"I was around 16 or 17 when this record was released, and it was another Masterpiece by the Kings of Metal! This release, like the three before it, is part of the foundation of Manowar's Kingdom. This is one of my favorite Cd's of all time. It has some of the Heaviest moments in Manowar history, it's raw, stripped down, and heavy. This is what True Heavy Metal is all about. If I were going to give somebody a few CD's  to give them an idea of what Manowar is really about, it would be the first 4 CD's, because they truly are a great period for the band. During that time period, information about Manowar was hard to come by  here in the United States; the media ignored them, and the critics panned them, and neither had a just cause for doing so - Manowar's musical abilities far outweighed any of the bands that were getting coverage. Joey DeMaio is still the most original  bassist around, Eric Adams' voice is simply unbelievable (I've studied voice for the last 6 years - trust me, the guy is incredible). Scott Columbus is simply my favorite drummer. I began playing drums well over 20 years ago, and John Bonham was quickly replaced by Scott Columbus; and we finally come to Ross the Boss - there is not another guitarist around who has the style that Ross has.   The first 4 releases were recorded in Analog - that's why the releases that came out after this had a much different sound, the band began utilizing Digital Recording equipment for the following releases. For me, this CD was the end of an era, because Manowar's sound changed and became a bit more polished and less raw, and it wasn't until they released Triumph of Steel that they regained a lot of the rawness that the digital recording medium of the late 80's seemed to kill.   That said, I would highly recommend this CD to anyone wanting to get a taste of what Manowar was really about."
1,"I was disappointed that the ""Open Your Eyes (Baloobalot Hot House Piano Dub)"" by Rhythm Scholar was not on this CD.  It's really the only Donovan worth listening to.  Skip this and get something by Ochwat & Sam or Spanky My Monkey instead"
2,"To be honest, I must have hit a button by mistake which caused me to order something I really hadn't intended on buying.  There was no way to cancel it on-line so I figured I'd give the CD a listen, since I had Nellie's first CD, which I love.   I must say, I was disappointed.  Just seemed like every song sounded the same.  Maybe it will grow on me, the more I listen to it, but kinda doubting it"
1,"In my opinion, this is one of the worst things Reba has ever done.  Most of the songs are the typical pop flavored stuff that country music has become these days.  Its too bad and its an irony too because back in the 1980s she revitalized the traditionalist movement along with George Strait and Ricky Skaggs.  Why did she change??  To record stuff like this???  Awful"
1,This CD I regret to say is not up to Reba's standard of performance.  She's done much better. 
1,"Wow...I thought this album was going to be ""Too Damn Hot""...it is ""So Damn Not"" that it's frightening.    The tunes are weak, the Doctor's playing is OKAY but not inspired and Bernstein's guitar playing is beyond lame.  I've seen Bernstein at a club uptown and he was decent at best (better comping, not a great soloist) but this album doesn't display the best of either of these wonderful musicians' capabilities"
1,Arrrrgggghhh! This was the worst Geto Boys offering I have heard to date! Obviously Scarface wasn't enough to save this &quot;album&quot;. Why wasn't Bushwick in on this one? Most of the songs were performed by Willie-D and  I'm sorry but Willie-D can't rap! There isn't one single song on  this album that I would refer to anyone! This GB product deserves to be put  in the trash. I'm a true Geto Boys fan and I say to other GB fans out  there: DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!
5,"If you want to relive your days in the 60' use this CD to bring back old memories of what you were up to then. Fantastic, even better than before enhanced by CD quality"
5,"I bought this for my dad, (a Willie fan) but having a chance to listen myself found it to be a charming, innovative amalgamation of simple, sincere, sometime sinister, musical thought based on a recurring theme. A "" stand alone"" accomplishment from an American icon"
2,"There were multiple recordings of some of the same songs on this ablum. I can see doing maybe one song, two different ways. However, there was one song done three different ways and another song done twice which almost sounded the same"
5,"Although not a document of a working band, this is clearly a record Dave Douglas wanted to make. Following in the tradition of his sextet in honouring the compositions of particular composers, he has drawn together  the sympathetic talents of James Genus, Bill Carrothers and Billy Hart to  pay tribute to Joni Mitchell. Hers is music he obviously loves, the  reconstructions sounding like jazz standard song repertoire. The other  music uses Joni Mitchell's ear for a great tune as a springboard for Dave's  thoughtful, instantly appealing compositions. Beautifully recorded, this is  a one-off; don't miss it"
1,"You know this guy did appeal to me at first, but if you have this CD youve heard American Bad Ass, right? Listen to Metallicas &quot;Sad But True&quot;. He ripped off the guitar part completely. H e tries to be metal, hardcore rap, and country at the same time. Fails miserably. He is a talentless wigger. Wait...thats too nice. I hope he commits suicide"
5,"This is, perhaps, The Rolling Stones' masterpiece. After the disaster that was ""His Satanic Majesty's Request"" the band clearly decided to stop slavishly copying trends (and, one might add, following in The Beatles' footsteps).   Brian Jones appears only sporadically, it's his last album with the band. The Stones brought in Jimmy Miller to produce, after having learned the hard way that they work best when they have someone besides Mick and Keith at the mixing board. Nicky Hopkins' contribution to this album can't be understated. Rumor has it that Ry Cooder participated in the sessions.  ""Sympathy For The Devil"" kicks things off. For an inside look at the evolution of this iconic song see Jean Luc Godard's ""One Plus One"" (aka ""Sympathy For The Devil""). This song was scary and groundbreaking back in 1967 - now that we've all heard it 1,000+ times it seems far too familiar. In my opinion this is one of Mick's best lyrics.  ""No Expectations"" is a beautiful song, with lovely piano work by Hopkins. The lyric is a bit trite, but it works. Believe it or not this was the first single - it's perhaps the weakest song on the album.  ""Dear Doctor"" is really, really funny. The Stones were fans of country music, but here they take on the form as a cliche. ""For the gal I'm to marry / Is a bow-legged sow / I've been soakin' up drink like a sponge."" This is a hoot.  ""Stray Cat Blues"" - another reviewer stated that this is a homage to fans of the band. Jeez, I hope not! This is very creepy stuff. Mick's growls in the intro are absolutely filthy (""Yeah, just don't care...""). He sings this like an utter pervert, which is the point. ""Well I can see that you're 15 years old / But I don't want your ID."" By now it's obvious to the listener that The Stones have reinvented themselves - where did this sound come from? It's unlike anything we've heard on previous Stones albums.   ""Jigsaw Puzzle"" - many fans don't care for this song. It's a bit of a throwback, somewhat reminiscent of ""Something Happened To Me Yesterday"" and a few others from the previous incarnations of the band. Mick's lyric is a bit overwritten, but the final verse in particular is quite good. The band jams out well here - Keith, Wyman and Hopkins play off one another brilliantly, particularly in the coda. It's a fine side-ender.  ""Street Fighting Man"" - some of this was recorded in a living room. The basic drums are Charlie banging on telephone directory books. Some of the guitars were recorded on a cheap tape deck. The sitar is Brian; more amazing Hopkins piano here. This was, I believe, the start of Keith using the famous ""open G"" tuning he has employed since. A solid song, but I've always thought it a bit over-rated.  ""Prodigal Son"" - country blues, based on the Bible story. Mick's lyric is perfect, as is his vocal delivery. No contemporary British band could sound as authentically American when doing this style of blues.  ""Parachute Woman"" - more blues, but now we move from the Delta to the Big City. Bill Wyman has often referred to this is his all-time favorite Stones track. The sound is (purposefully?) muddy, and it feels perhaps a bit off-hand at first listen - but give it a chance. This is powerful stuff.    ""Factory Girl"" - an underrated gem. It's a beautiful song with a lilting melody, a fun yet poignant lyric, and a wonderful performance by all. ""Waitin' for a girl who's got stains all down her dress / waitin' for a girl and my feet are gettin' wet / she ain't come out yet / waitin' for a factory girl"" - that's as fine a depiction of working class life as I've yet come across.   ""Salt Of The Earth"" - the first verse is Keith Richard's first lead vocal on record. This is a stirring song, an apt followup to ""Factory Girl."" I wasn't at all surprised that this was a song Mick and Keith chose to perform at ""The Concert For NYC."" The vamp in the last 1/3 or so of this song is brilliant musicianship.  If one is familiar with The Rolling Stones only as a ""hit"" group, this album could be disappointing - there's no obvious Top Ten hit here. But if you appreciate music, and if you know anything about the history of this group, you will appreciate the fact that this was a groundbreaking album.   There isn't a bad track here. Each is brilliant in its own way. And, of course, this was the first of five great albums produced by The Stones - ""Beggar's Banquet,"" ""Let It Bleed,"" ""Get Yer Ya Ya's Out,"" ""Sticky Fingers,"" and ""Exile On Main Street."" They had never before reached these heights - and never would again.  The Rolling Stones are regarded by most fans and critics as contemporaries of The Beatles and Bob Dylan (""The Holy Trinity"" of the 60's) on the strength of the five albums noted above. They had a lot of hits before ""Beggar's Banquet,"" but if that was all they'd done they would be regarded as equals to The Animals or The Yardbirds, etal. They became rock royalty when they produced ""Beggar's Banquet."
2,"Slayer released Diablos in Musica in 1998.  This is a decent thrash album, but definitely not up to Slayer's standards.  Yeah, some people think Slayer sucks and they say they are over-rated.  These people are entitled to their opinion.  That being said, Diablos really is Slayers weakest album.  Maybe Tom Araya was able to sing in 1988, but his singing 10 years later just ruins the music.  His normal vocals are ok, but when he sings or tries a spoken word section, it really shows that he should stick with what he knows (if only James Hetfield took my advise; his voice makes me want to puke now).  Songs like Death's Head, Stain of Mind, Love to Hate are probably the worst Slayer songs they wrote up to this point.    This is the Slayer album I listen to the least.  There are song good songs:  Bitter Peace, Overt Enemy, Scrum and Screaming From The Sky.  Too bad the rest of the album is rather boring. "
1,"I did not expect a primer on Indian music.  I expectd, instead  examples of songs in different styles.  This CD does do that to a limited extent, but Ravi Shankar spends too much time instructing the audience.  The music that is presented seems rough and un rehearse"
1,"I bought this record assuming the songs would be as poignant and memorable as those on II. Instead, I found the music to be busy and impersonal, and I thought the lyrics (once again in comparison to those on II) sucked. Its often said that Up on the Sun demonstrates the Meat Puppets coming into their own 'sound', and that its a vast improvement over II. I fail to see how their work on II was any less of a genuine expresssion of the bands vision than this frankly dull piece of work"
5,"A half century ago, I was a junior in high school. We used to have these gatherings called ""assemblies,"" where the principal would collect the entire student body in the auditorium (no excuses allowed!) for an event of more than passing importance. At this late date, I can only remember a small handful of them: the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, President Truman relieving General MacArthur of his command. Oh, and one where two fellows from Ampex came to our high school to give a little demonstration of something called ""stereophonic sound,"" using, needless to say, an Ampex tape recorder.  And the music for this demonstration? It was the brief opening prologue (""Sunrise"") from Richard Strauss's ""Also Sprach Zarathustra,"" in this very same Reiner/Chicago Symphony Orchestra recording. This was a ""sneak preview to end all sneak previews,"" inasmuch as the monophonic LP (""New Orthophonic,"" I believe it was called) hadn't even been released at that early date. And, needless to say, this impressionable teenager was suitably impressed. So much so that, in the years to come, I acquired three LPs of the performance: the original monophonic LP, then the Living Stereo LP a few years later, and eventually, when the stereo LP had seen its better days, the Dynagroove rerelease (something I'd just as soon forget). I never did go the reel-to-reel route, and, when CDs eventually made their appearance, I opted for other performances of these two Strauss works rather than the earlier conventional Living Stereo CD release. But I always did have fond memories of that particular reel-to-reel tape demonstration back in '54; it was a direct copy of the 30ips master tape, and not the 7.5ips ""consumer"" version that came out shortly thereafter.  With BMG now releasing half-century-old Living Stereo classics as hybrid SACDs (10 at present, with surely more on the way), it was easy for me to select this recording as one of the first to sample. I was more than pleasantly surprised; just listening to the ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" prologue had the effect of turning the clock back 50 years; truly a trip down Memory Lane!  In a phrase, I wasn't disappointed. Even listening to the conventional CD layer, it was easy to get the sense that there I was again, listening to the 30ips master tape. Even with headphones, I heard no evidence of tape hiss; just beautifully balanced stereo sound with a tremendous sense of not only left-to-right spatial array but depth as well. (This is particularly evident in ""The hero's battlefield"" segment of ""Ein Heldenleben,"" where the initial muted trumpet fanfares sound as if they are coming from well behind the orchestra.) Throughout both massive tone poems, the music is well-served by RCA's ""minimalistic"" microphoning, with just two mikes picking up the sound field, and every single instrumental voice (and there are many of them) can clearly be heard. (Sir Thomas Beecham, that evergreen source of bon mots, reserved one of his best for ""Ein Heldenleben"" when he wrote that ""I once spent a couple of days in a train with a German friend. We amused ourselves by discovering how many notes we could take out of 'Ein Heldenleben' and leave the music essentially intact. By the time we finished we had taken out fifteen thousand."")  As for Reiner's interpretations, perhaps the simplest way of putting it is that there is no time in the last half century that I can recall when these two performances were NOT included in EVERY ""essential recordings"" discography (even when the sound quality was not as it is here, in the hybrid SACD release). Reiner had a way of not oversentimentalizing these two works, as if they had been the products of one of the world's greatest egos, which, in fact, they were: Strauss made no bones about himself being the hero of ""Ein Heldenleben."" Reiner keeps things moving along, lest they bog down for the empty rhetoric that they can often be in lesser hands.  A century ago, when Strauss had been the most famous composer who was also a conductor and Gustav Mahler had been the most famous conductor who was also a composer, audiences couldn't get enough of the Strauss tone poems. (I think, in fact, that the record will show that Mahler conducted Strauss's tone poems more frequently than he did his own symphonies!)  And a half-century ago, when I had been in my musical adolescence, so to speak, I too couldn't get enough of them. But they haven't worn all that well in the intervening years. Now, considerably older and modestly wiser, I can only take them in infrequent doses. (Perhaps I've simply taken Strauss at his word when he described himself as ""a first-rate second-rate composer."") And, fortunately for this now-jaded me, these Reiner performances, long perfect in everything but sound quality, have arrived with, finally, sound quality that matches the performances.  I have every expectation that future ""essential  recordings"" discographies will continue to include these performances, now with this newly-refurbished sound quality that is the match of any.  Bob Zeidle"
2,"This album was a disappointment. I was looking forward to Muddy's covers of &quot;Caldoinia&quot; and &quot;Kansas City&quot; but it wasnt what I thought itd be. Dont get me wrong, Muddy himself was fine, but he gets  overshadowed by the musical collaborators. There is an overuse of harmonica  and organ, and the annoying presence of ACCORDIAN! Accordians and Waters do  not mix. This over-instrumentalization leaves the album sounding lame and  folky and not bluesy. If you're looking for Muddy's later work, try  &quot;Blues Sky&quot;, with Muddy working with Johnny Winter and his back  to basics production"
1,"I tried not to give it any stars, which is what it deserves.  I have a difficult time understanding why Mr. Eastwood continues to write the soundtrack to the films he's involved in.  There are composers like Harry Gregson-Williams, Elliot Goldenthal, James Newton Howard, David Julyan, Mark Isham, etc... that can create something meaningful and 10 times more advanced than what ""Dirty Harry"" can create.  Would the director and executives of another major motion picture accept a soundtrack of this quality?    I hated Mystic River's soundtrack as well.  I think he got lucky with Million Dollar Baby.  Not much music that might have ruined the acting, and no inspirational music when she is winning all the fights, unlike the Rocky movies.    I am very aware that he doesn't posess the education, training, and experience that all of the major Hollywood composers do.  But he should stick to acting and directing.  He has proven himself to be very good at both of those with the awards he has recieved in his lifetime.  I think he is just trying to show off at how much he can contribute to a movie.  And his ""music"" is nothing noteworthy at all, in my opinion.     While his attempt to write another score is surprising, it leaves so much to be desired in a film like Flags of Our Fathers.  It's a tremendous film, with an interesting story, great characters, great acting, and authentic battle scenes, much like Saving Private Ryan (John Williams).  They have a meaningful well-made film ready for a composer to add thier ideas and talents to, and make a great movie-going experience.  And then we get the same boring nursery rhyme style melody and chord progression over and over and over again.  And then on top of that, it's rudementally orchestrated between guitar, piano, and trumpet with those long droning strings.  Granted, not much to work with for Lennie Niehaus who orchestrated it.    I got so sick of it on just one viewing only.  And the scene when the son is looking at the pictures and the medal, as stupidly simple as that melody is, I think it's completely intrusive in that scene.  It ruined a moment that could have been very moving with anything different musically, or maybe no music at all.  I believe everyone has a job when making a movie, and when one person is doing too much, the quality suffers.  And that's if Clint Eastwood was an educated composer, which he isn't.  No one can deny that, not even him.  As I mentioned before there are so many composers out there that could have made that film even more moving and powerful.  I think that the executives looked the other way and let something like this happen because of a big name like Clint Eastwood.  Film music is an evolving art form constantly struggling to get the recognition it deserves.  And with good moives being made that are horribly scored in this way, it's not helping the film music world at all.  It is admirable for someone to try new things and contribute in ways not thought of before.  But when they don't have any talent, they shouldn't be allowed to do it.  I am an aspiring film composer taking classes, going to movies, and buying soundtracks to learn as much as I can about it.  It gives me a moment of pause when decisions like this are being made about major films.  I know it's just Clint Eastwood attempting this, but what if more actors and/or non-composers try doing it?    Please, no more soundtracks Mr. Eastwood!  You do what you are good at and leave the music to the established, experienced, and well-known composers of Hollywood.  Bryan Arata             "
5,"Listening to 'Mastered the Art' is the acoustic equivalent of running your hand over shag carpet that hasn't been vacuumed since the seventies - it reveals a surprising accumulation of hidden textures and diverse beats, from Spanish-style acoustic guitars and menacing orchestration to xylophones and Galaga samples (you know the tractor beam sound just before your ship gets taken up). 'Mastered the Art' is a gigantic mixed-media canvas that subsumes all the brilliance of his previous albums while adding authentic variation and depth. Like any original work of art, 'Mastered the Art' is difficult to categorize - it represents the leading edge in the ongoing revolution that is combining hip-hop, jazz, groove, and funk into unique and powerful musical expressions. Greyboy is an accomplished composer and this album is a masterpiece. Now if only he'd publish the complete list of his 8-track collection. . "
4,"If the Astralwerks label that released this 1973 gem were clever they'd re-release it with a bright yellow sticker on the cover that says: ""FEATURING: 'SUPER 16', AS HEARD IN THE NEW QUENTIN TARATINO MOVIE KILL BILL VOL.1!!!"" Then watch the sales of NEU! 2 surge its way up to the top of the Billboard album charts, purchased by young hipsters salivating for any and all obscure references incorporated into the cult movie flick.  Okay, that may never happen, but still, it was quite a treat to hear the brief snippet of ""Super 16""'s turntable sludge ooze from the speakers of Tarantino's movie. ""Super 16"" might serve a few seconds of quirky soundtrack music, but as representation of the superb, and breif, discography of NEU!'s body of work it does the band a great disservice. Hearing this track rekindled my interest in NEU!'s music again, and to write this review.  NEU! 2 is perhaps best approached as two halves, the first half, which consits of the first 4 tracks: ""Fur Immer"", ""Spitzenwualitat"", ""Gedenkminute"", and ""Lila Engel"" (as of this writing Amazon's tracklisting is incorrect) . This is the heart of the album, with the driving ""Fur Immer"" connecting the dots between Kraftwerk's motor beats with alternative rock riffing.  ""Lila Engel""  pounds agressively like there's no tomorrow, years before it became fashionable in punk music.  Did I mention this music was originally released in '73? Awesome!  The second half consits of the remaining 7 tracks which, reportedly due to budget restraints, were recorded with minimal material. The band's solution was to drag or speed up pieces of their own music in various configurations using a turntable (complete with needle drops and vinyl scraping). The woozy ""Cassetto"" feeds music through a dying cassette player until its last, wretched gasp. This section of NEU! 2 is remixing in its most primitive form. Although it's an amusing idea to recycle pre-existing material in this fashion, the approach wears itself thin quite early, and hardly justifies any repeat listens.    I would say that NEU! 2 is second best behind the band's self-titled debut (Rating: 5 stars), and tied with their 3rd and final(?) effort NEU! 75, where NEU! were beginning to sound too self-conscious, IMHO.  NEU!'s music has become better with age and surpasses any music out here that is being labeled ""alternative"" these days.  It's good enough for Tarantino, and it's good enough for you! BUY IT!  Favorite tracks:  ""Fur Immer"", ""Lila Engel"",  ""Super""  Final Rating: 3.5 out of 5."
5,"This album is without any doubt one of the most original CDs I have ever heard. The success in which Kearney mixes musical styles is astounding. What makes this album so enjoyable besides the catchy melodies, good lyrics and his voice is the top notch production given to each of the tracks. There is so much here that one most listen to the album a good 3 or 4 times before you start to truly appreciate the depth of this work."
1,"Auch ich bin der Meinung, dass Selena Gomez lieber beim Schauspielern bleiben sollte!!! Es mag zwar sein, dass sie möglicherweise eine ganz nette Stimme hat, aber bei diesen Liedern merkt man davon nichts!!! Also an alle: Hände weg von diesem Album!!!"
2,"Dies ist meine erste Rezension, aber da ich die CD auf Druck meiner Tochter kaufen musste, und ich sie daher schon oft genug angehört habe, und grad' mal wieder hier bin, will ich doch auch was dazu schreiben. Das Lied hat den üblichen Aufbau der aktuellen Hits ... Einen langsamen Anfang .. dann folgt der Refrain ... ein zweiter langsamer Teil ... wieder vom Refrain gefolgt ... nun kommt was Entscheindes ... der atypischer Teil ... oft isses heutzutage ein Rap ... hier was Gesungenes entgegen der Hauptmelodie ... und der Schluss besteht aus Refrain und Variationen desselben. Um schließlich in einer dahingehauchten Wiederholung des Themas zu enden. Dies soll aber nicht wirklich Kritik an diesem Lied sein, fast alle Hits folgen diesem Rezept. Was in diesem Konzept sehr entscheidend ist, ist der Refrain. Je eingängiger dieser ist, desto eingängiger/erfolgreicher das Lied. Und ... der Refrain ist schon schier genial... also, finde ich, sehr eingängig ... lädt zum Mit-Summen/-Singen ein. Daher für den Komponisten 4 Sterne. 1 Punkt Abzug, weil der ganze Ablauf des Liedes so beliebig ist und eben nur der Refrain so gut ist ... aber der Refrain ist schon sehr genial. Aber nun zur Interpretation ... und das betrifft nicht nur die Sängerinnen ... ... es ist nicht wirklich das Gelbe vom Ei ... im Refrain hört man vor lauter Geschepper fast nichts mehr von den Stimmen (ich hoffe doch, das ist nicht Absicht). Der Gesang ist in den Introparts ganz nett, aber wenn alle 4 einstimmen, isses nicht mehr so angenehm.  Drum würd ich mir das Lied vielleicht lieber von einer einzelnen Sängerin interpretiert (die, die den ersten Part singt, fand ich recht angenehm) oder zumindest akzentuierter gesungen und instrumentiert wünschen.  Fazit: Die Interpretation lässt noch sehr viel Spielraum nach oben. Daher nur 1 Punkt. Ergibt zusammen 5 Punkte ... durch 2 ergibt 2,5 Punkte. Aber hier kann ich leider nicht kaufmännisch runden ... da nur der Refrain eine bessere Bewertung verdient hätte ... Bleiben 2 Punkte."
4,Ich stiess per Zufall im Internet auf dieses Album und war positiv überrascht. Hier weht frischer Wind durch die Girlie-Szene. Die Songs klingen überraschend rockig und erwachsen. Von dieser Sorte Musik möchte ich gerne mehr hören.
1,"Ich bin ja ein großer Ersguterjunge-Fan und deswegen habe ich mir auch das neue Album von Nyze geholt, und hatte hohe Erwarungen an ihn, da er 2007 sein letztes Album veröffenlicht hat, also hatte er sich zwei Jahre Zeit ein Album zu machen, und ich hoffte das sich Nyze weiterentlickelt hat. Nur auf diesem Album habe ich keine Entwicklung sehen können, egal ob es die Produktion ist, die Texte oder die Technik. Nyze ist auf der Strecke geblieben, denn die Rapfans, wollen keine Alben mehr, wo zu 95 % unsinnige Lieder aufgenommen werden. Denn wenn mehr Abwechslung auf diesem Album wäre, ist für jeden was dabei. Nyze, hör lieber auf, außerdem bin ich erschrocken, was die Texte betrifft, denn diese sind, wirklich lächerlich. Das beste Lied ist ""Waiting"" das, sowohl textlich und vom Beat her, das Beste hier ist, was auf diesem Album ist. D-Bo rappt echt gechillt und locker, das es Spaß macht denn Track anzuhören und auch Nyze rappt hier gut. Ein wirkliche Plamage, das Album wirkt so unprofessionell und nicht gewollt."

5,"Nachdem ich LDN und Smile schon oft genug gehört hatte, dachte ich mir, kauf ich mir doch mal das Album. Und bereuen tue ich das ganz bestimmt nicht! Wenn man die CD zum ersten mal hört, dann gefallen einem vielleicht die Lieder. Richtig gut wird die CD dann aber erst, wenn man sie ein paar mal hört und auch auf die Texte achtet. Dass Lily Allen darin immer das Bad-Girl ist, stört nicht, die Texte sind echt, lustig und frech. Schade nur, dass man eigentlich auch noch die Singles kaufen muss, da auf dem Album nur 11 Tracks sind, und auf den Singles dafür jede Menge Bonustracks...! Am besten gefällt mir ""Littlest Things"", und ich kann die CD jedem wärmstens empfehlen, dem auch die ersten beiden Lieder gefallen haben!"

5,"Wow, da hat sich aber jemand weiterentwickelt! Kann der Rezension von KarlHeinz überhaupt nicht zustimmen. Während ich ""Lebe lauter"" durchaus hörenswert, aber nicht außergewönlich fand, ist dieses Album für mich ein Überraschungs-Hammer. Die Stimme klingt viel kräftiger und professioneller. Außerdem gute Texte mit Anspruch, aber nicht lehrermäßig intellektuell! Bekomme auch beim zehnten Höhren teilweise noch Gänsehaut. Allein der Song ""Mehr als perfekt"" rechtfertigt den Kauf dieser Scheibe!"
5,"Dieses Album hat mich mitten ins Herz getroffen. Besonders ""Beschütze mich"" hat mich sehr berührt. Es ist absolut zu empfehlen, würde es im Moment am Liebsten jedem, der mir am Herzen liegt schenken. Danke an meine Mutter,die sich das Album zu Weihnachten gewünscht hat und mich erst darauf brachte..."
5,"OK. Politische Songs gegen den aktuellen amerikanischen Präsidenten gibt es inzwischen viele. Auch gegen religiösen Fundumentalismus und Zensur wurde schon viel gesungen (das geht sogar eher gegen Frau Lieberman). Aber, was Pearl Jam hier auf CD gebrannt haben, brennt ein wahres, rockges Grungefeuer über die Anlage ab.  Musikalisch sind Pearl Jam nicht mehr sehr ruhig und melanchonisch, die CD erinnert eher an die fantastische ""Vs"", Als Anspieltipp empfehle ich ""World Wide Suicide"", wobei dieser Song nicht nur musikalisch glänzt.  Wer die CD erst einmal angespielt hat, wird längere Zeit nichts anderes mehr hören."
4,"Knapp zehn Jahre nach ihrem Debütalbum Ten präsentieren Pearl Jam wieder ein Album mit all ihren Stärken - kräftiger, schnörkerlloser Hardrock ohne große Ausfälle. Ihre musikalischen Abstecher (manche nennen es Künsteleien), die schon auf ihrem zweiten Wurf Vs. zu erkennen waren, bis hin zu Riot Act aus dem Jahre 2002. Und immer wieder fragte man sich, wohin die Band eigentlich wolle. Welches Ziel verfolgen sie, haben sie eigentlich den Sound, den signifikanten PJ-Sound? Und nun bleibt nichts anderes übrig als die einstigen musikalischen Wurzeln: muskulöser, leicht abschweifiger Rock, aufgepuscht durch Eddie Vedders erfrischende Aufrichtigkeit in den Lyrics, sodass man sich immer mehr damit identifizieren kann, sofern man auch einen solch protestantischen Charakter wie Ed hat. Noch nie haben sich Pearl Jam so hart und direkt angehört wie hier - selbst auf Ten zeigte deren Musik eine gewisse Elastizität, teilweise durch Jeff Aments bundloses Bassspiel bedingt, das wiederum eine rundere Dynamik zuließ. Dies hielt PJs Sounds nahezu davon ab, sich direkt bis zu den Gedärmen durchzuschlagen, quasi ohne Kompromisse. Pearl Jam hört sich aber diesmal so kompromisslos an, und das ist das erfrischende und, zugegeben, auch überraschende Element dieser Scheibe. Denn so wirklich gerechnet hat man damit nun nicht. Gerade auf der ersten Hälfte hört sich alles sehr kraftvoll und wütend an, wie beispielsweise ""Life Wasted"", ""World Wide Suicide"", ""Comatose"", ""Severed Hand"" und ""Marker in the Sand"". Jedes Lied toppt das vorherige auf seine Art und Weise. Dadurch klingt das Album authentischer und feuriger. Auch die Balladen sind ein wichtiger Bestandteil von Pearl Jam - eingeleitet wird der ruhige Teil durch ""Parachutes"", womit sich der Sound für das Weichere und Einfühlsamere öffnet. Auch wenn die zweite Hälfte eine größere Vielfalt von Tempiwechseln hat, bietet es immer noch eine grandiose Anzahl von Rockern: angefangen beim ironischen Stolzieren von ""Uemployable"" bis hin zum furiosen ""Big Wave"". Abgerundet wird alles durch de beiden Schlusslichter des Albums ""Come Back"" und ""Inside Job"", wobei letzeres an ""Indifference"" und ""Release"" erinnert, mit seiner anmutigen Magik und träumerischen Weite, die der Sound, und vor allem das Intro, hergeben. Der Soultouch von ""Inside Job"" erinnert auch irgendwie an ""Black"", wobei ""Inside Job"" durchaus epischer klingt und somit auch den besseren Schlusssong eines Albums darstellt.  Pearl Jams Wut und Ärger ist auf dto. anders als auf deren Vorgängern. Eddie Vedder schaut mehr auf die Welt als solches, auf die Probleme der USA, und vor allem auf die, die durch GW Bush verursacht werden (""World Wide Suicide""). All seine Texte und die damit herauskommende Wut und Frustration machen Pearl Jam womöglich zu dem Protestalbum des Jahres, wenn nicht sogar seit Anfang 2000. Außerdem ist die Stärke des Albums, dass es einfach als reine Musik genossen werden kann, ohne dass man sich zu sehr auf Vedders Texte konzentrieren muss. Diesmal steht die Musik mehr im Vordergrund. Vedders Texte scheinen nicht so metaphorisch und bildgeladen zu sein wie sonst immer. Alles musikalische, das die Band anpackt, scheint außerdem zu gelingen. Ob es nun der Hardrock von ""Life Wasted"" oder der ruhige Part wie ""Parachutes"" ist.  Seit Vitalogy haben sich Pearl Jam nicht mehr so frisch, direkt und lebend angehört wie hier."

Und dafür wurde eine Vielzahl an renommierten Produzenten verpflichtet, die (wie meist) leider auch hier den Brei verderben. Denn entweder ist Sarah Connor oft dazu verurteilt, selbst im internationalen Vergleich schlechte Texte zu singen oder aber ihre erstklassige Stimme leidet durch die schlechte Produktion. So kann nur die Ballade für ihre Tochter (""I`ll Kiss It Away""), bei der genügend Raum für ihr Gesangstalent bleibt, gefallen. Darüber hinaus werden zwar fette Beats bei ""Sexy As Hell"" oder ""Under My Skin"" gefallen, doch ist das alles leider nur langweiliger Durchschnitt, bei dem man am Ende nicht weiß, wer da eigentlich gerade singt. Und ein paar im Augenblick so schicke 80er-Reminiszenzen mit u.a. ""See You Later"" dürfen auch hier nicht fehlen. Aus der ambitionierten Idee, aus Sarah Connor einen internationalen Act zu machen, ist nach hinten losgegangen. Denn ihre Stärke - ihre Stimme - wird auf diesem Album nicht genutzt. Leider ist ""Sexy As Hell"" ein gesichtloses Produzentenalbum geworden."

1,"Das Hörbuch von Comedian Mario Barth ist, um es auf den Punkt zu bringen, leider sehr Enttäuschend. Schon das Taschenbuch blieb hinter den Erwartungen an ein Langenscheidt-Produkt weit zurück."
5,"irgendwie witzig,eingaengig einfach eine tolle Idee diese Single von Hape. Hier zeigt Hape Kerkeling das er mehr wie ein Komiker oder Schauspieler ist.Das Stueck ""Schaetzelein"" fehlt bei uns miilerweile auch auf keiner Party mehr.Es ist einafch immer wieder nett anzuhoeren,also wer die Single bis jetzt noch nicht hat zugreifen lohnt..es bestehen keine Riskiken oder Nebenwirkungen negativer Art.Danke Horst ( Hape)geb uns mehr davon...hier klare 5 Sterne Herr Schlaemmer !!!"
1,"PUR sind wieder da. Dagegen ist ja nichts zu sagen, hat sich die Band in letzter Zeit doch sehr rar gemacht. Gerade deshalb dürfte die Erwartungshaltung bei den ""besten Fans der Welt"" ziemlich groß sein. Leider naht mit der ersten Singleauskoppelung auch schon die erste Enttäuschung, denn ""Irgendwo"" ist völlig uninspiriert und durch die fehlende Abgrenzung zwischen Vers und Refrain und der hierduch fehlenden Steigerung schlichtweg langweilig. Das klingt irgendwie so, als habe sich PUR bei PUR bedient und vergessen, einen Refrain einzufügen. Schlimm. Hinzu kommt, dass der Text des vermeintlichen Refrains nahezu 1:1 bei den Comedian Harmonist abgekupfert wurde, die einst ""Irgendwo auf der Welt gibt's ein kleines bißchen Glück"" sangen. Bei PUR heißt es: ""Irgendwo in dieser Welt liegt ein bisschen Glück versteckt"". Toll - wenn man sich schon musikalisch keine große Mühe gibt, sollte doch wenigstens der Text aus der eigenen Feder stammen. Insgesamt prophezeie ich diesem Titel daher keinen großen Erfolg. Und da üblicherweise die erste Singleauskoppelung eines der Highlights des sich anschließenden Albums darstellt, möchte ich gar nicht wissen, was ""Wünsche"" an Songmaterial noch so zu bieten hat. Das verheißt nichts Gutes ..."
2,"Ich bin auch ein grosser Fan von Greatest Hits-CDs und solche, die welche sein sollen. Diese CD von Simply Red finde ich nicht übel, doch fehlen hier doch einige Stücke. Wenn eine solche von Simply Red, dann empfehle ich eher die blaue ""Very best of"" CD, da sind dann doch einige Hits mehr drauf und man hat mehr von der Band. Zugute halte ich hier die DVD mit den Videos, wobei nicht alle vertreten sind. Aber für Leute die noch nix haben, sehr zu empfehlen."
2,"Auch auf die Gefahr hin jetzt böse angemacht zu werden...muss ich doch sagen bzw. fragen: Was ist nur aus Frauenarzt und Manny Marc geworden? Die neue Richtung der beiden steht einfach total im Gegensatz zu dem, was die beiden früher gefeiert haben. Ich erinnere dabei gerne an ""Berlin bleibt Untergrund"" und ""Berlin bleibt Untergrund - Das Mixtape""...wie die Titel schon sagen, stand vor allem Frauenarzt für kompromisslosen Hardcore- bzw. Pornorap! Aussagen wie ""wir ändern uns nie"" standen im Vordergrund. Dabei hat Frauenarzt bis zu letzt ja durchaus sein eigenes Ding durchgezogen und seine letzten beiden (richtigen) und indizierten Alben waren seinem alten Stil treu. Der neue Stil der Atzen ist für mich sehr fragwürdig, gerade im Hinblick auf Authentizität. Wenn man ehrlich ist, sind Tracks wie ""Das geht ab"" nichts weiter als sehr house- und technolastige ""Mitgröhl""-Songs... Wo ist die Realness und der Rap?? Was ist mit uns...alten Fans...??"
2,"Moinsen, ich habe mir die Comic Edt. zugelegt und muss sagen, dass ich ziemlich enttäuscht bin. Habe diesem Artikel demnach nur 2 Sterne gegeben; also der Comic Edition! Warum, möchte ich im Folgenden erläutern. Man bezahlt mehr, als für die Standard Edt. Nun sind auf der Bonus CD leider lediglich 5 Remix-Tracks vom Hahnenkampfalbum drauf (selbe Texte!! mit schlechten neuen Beatz unterlegt..). Ich habe mir da etwas mehr versprochen..! Diese 5 ""neuen"" Tracks sind jedoch ihr Geld absolut nicht wert.  Die 2 CDs bekommt ihr in einem ca. DVD großen Papp-Cover und es liegt, wie der Name schon sagt, ein KiZ-Comic bei, der allerdings meiner Meinung nach den Aufpreis auch nicht rechtfertigt. Diese Edition ist meiner Meinung nach absolut nicht empfehlenswert, da das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis nicht passt. Anders sieht es da mit dem Album an sich aus.  Da kann ich meinen Vorrednern nur beipflichten. Ich weiss nicht, ob es wirklich besse rist als Hahnenkampf oder Böhse Enkelz, jedoch knüpft es nahtlos an diese Alben an. Der K.I.Z-typische Humor und Stil ist auch auf SgR wiederzufinden und auf jedenfall einen Kauf wert! Zudem sind sie gesellschaftskritischer und vielfältiger als je zuvor.  Das Album ist meiner Meinugn nach auch persönlicher als alle vorhergegangenen. So erfährt man z.B. mehr über die Wurzeln der einzelnen Interpreten der Crew. Weiterhin ist das Albu mwie erwähnt relativ vielseitig, da K.I.Z versucht haben möglichst viele ""Bevölkerungsschichten"" zu durchleuchten und dem Rezipienten vorzustellen. Natürlich überwiegend im gewohnt ironischen Stil. Um nun ein Fazit aus all dem zu ziehen: Album TOP! Comic Edition FLOP! mfg ein KIZ Groupie ;D"
5,"BARBRA STREISAND bringt den Gehalt ihrer Lieder mit Tiefgang und höchstem Feingefühl zum Ausdruck und berührt dabei die Herzen des Publikums. Ein harmonisches, exquisites Jazz-Album zum Entspannen, Träumen, Schwelgen, Schweben und davon Driften. Musik, die ganz ohne Bass und Effekte auskommt. Dezent untermalt mit den edlen Klängen des Piano. Hier steht das Wesentliche im Vordergrund: die Stimme und der Gesang. Diese Schlichtheit, Unverfälschtheit und Reinheit zieht magisch in den Bann, denn sie vermittelt ein faszinierendes Flair aus Intimität und Intensität. Ein Genuss für die Seele. Danke, Barbra, für dieses wundervolle Werk! Meine Favoriten: Some Other Time, In The Wee Small Hours Of The Morning, Where Do You Start, Gentle Rain."
5,"Whitney Houston ist zurück!!! Nach sieben Jahren stille,ist es Zeit geworden für ein neues Album. Nach privaten Tiefschlägen hat Whitney Houston sich wieder gefangen und fängt wieder an zu leben. Das Album ist anders als alle bisherigen Alben von Whitney Houston. Nicht nur wegen ihrer Stimme,die rauher und reifer geworden ist. Musikalisch pendelt das Album zwischen R'n'B,Disco und Ballade. Klingt im ersten Moment ungewöhnlich und ist es auch beim ersten hören. Aber der Spagat zwischen den Musikstilen hat geklappt. Es ist das erste Album einer bzw. eines Künstlers,das ich mir komplett vom ersten Song bis zum letzten Song immer wieder anhören kann. Das Album strotzt nur so vor Lebensfreude. Meine Lieblingssongs des Albums sind: Song 9/For the Lovers,Song 10/I got you,Song 11/Salute Der Song ""Salute"" gefällt mir am allerbesten. Also,ich finde das Album ist rundherum gelungen. Meine Kaufempfehlung:Kaufen,Kaufen,Kaufen!!!"
2,"Ich habe mir diese CD aufgrund der vielen positiven Rezensionen hier gekauft und habe gehofft auch Schlaflieder kennen zu lernen, die zwar althergebracht und bekannt sind, von denen ich die Texte aber noch nicht auswendig kann. (z.B. ""Schlafe mein Prinzchen, schlaf ein"" und ""Die Blümelein, sie schlafen"" und ""Ade zur guten Nacht"") Leider stand nirgendwo, dass die Lieder, die bekannte Volksweisen sind, alle vom Text her abgeändert wurden. :-( z.B. ""Guten Abend, Gute Nacht"", nach Johannes Brahms und mit dem Text von Georg Scherer. Überall steht im Inlay dahinter: ""Bearbeitung und NEUTEXTIERUNG: Mark Bender, Steve Summer &amp; Pete Winter"" Auch die Lieder: ""Weißt du wieviel Sternlein stehen"", ""Schlafe mein Prinzchen, schlaf ein"", ""Schlaf Kindlein, schlaf"", ""Die Blümelein, sie schlafen"", ""Still, still, still, weils Kindlein schlafen will"", ""Ade zur guten Nacht"" und ""Müde bin ich geh zur Ruh"" wurden NEUTEXTIERT. Sprich: Alle bekannten Lieder, die auf der CD drauf sind. Meist ist die erste Strophe die althergebrachte und die zweite Strophe wurde neu gedichtet. Die übrigen Lieder sind gänzliche Neuschöpfungen der Autoren und somit o.k. Auch die neu getexteten Strophen, der althergebrachten Lieder sind o.k., aber eben nicht das Erwartete. Sie sind aber auch nicht besonders einfallsreich. Sie scheinen sich vom Inhaltlichen her sehr an den traditionellen Kinder-Schlafliedern zu orientieren. Die Hintergrund-Musik ist bei allen Liedern irgendwie gleich, bzw. zumindest ähnlich, was ich dann nach dem fünften Lied auch eintönig fand. (Andererseits hilft dieses Eintönige vielleicht auch beim Einschlafen?) Die Hintergrundmusik ist mit dem Synthesizer gemacht, also künstlich und das hört sich nicht so dolle an. (Finde ich jedenfalls.) Es wäre schöner gewesen, wenn das ""dim düm düm döm"" (wie beschreibt man Laute? *gg*) auf einer echten Harfe gespielt worden und nicht computergeneriert wäre. Der Hall-Effekt wirkt irgendwann auch nervtötend! Die Sängerin(nen) sind eigentlich für ein Einschlaf-CD ganz in Ordnung und singen schön beruhigend und sanft.  Auch habe ich gehofft, dass, wie so oft bei Kinder-Musik-CDs, die Liedtexte im Inlay abgedruckt sind, damit man sie besser mitsingen kann. Dies ist leider auch nicht der Fall. Das neunte ""Lied"" ist gar kein Lied, wird jedenfalls nicht gesungen, sondern nur gesprochen und stört irgendwie, wenn man sie CD zum Einschlafen durchhört. Zwar ist diese ""Liebeserklärung"" an das Kind irgendwie süß, aber es passt nicht recht auf eine Einschlaf-CD. Auch das ""Müde bin ich geh zur Ruh"", welches nur gesprochen wird lässt einen am Ende der CD wieder aufwachen, weil es von den vorherigen Liedern so abweicht. Alles in allem entspricht diese Einschlaf-CD nicht meinen Erwartungen, welche vor allem durch positive Rezensionen geweckt wurde. Ich habe mir nun die CD ""Traumküsschen"" von Nico Bizer gekauft und die gefällt mir wesentlich besser."
2,"5 Jahre nach dem schwachen Encore-Album bringt Eminem nun also doch ein neues Studioalbum heraus, obwohl er seinerzeit in mehreren Interviews anklingen ließ, keine weiteren Soloalben zu veröffentlichen, sondern sich hauptsächlich aufs Produzieren zu konzentrieren. Hätte er sich doch nur an diesen Vorsatz gehalten, denn bei diesem neuen Album gibt es wirklich nichts mehr zu beschönigen. Abzüglich der Skits sind insgesamt 15 Lieder enthalten, wovon die ersten 11 von einer derart penetranten Eintönigkeit sind, das der vorab als Single veröffentlichte und eigentlich eher mittelmäßige Song ""We made you"" dazwischen wie ein einsamer Farbtupfer wirkt. Letztlich sind es nur die letzten drei Lieder, die das Album vor einer totalen Bankrotterklärung bewahren. Neben den immerhin hörbaren ""Beautiful"" und ""Crack a bottle"" erinnert eigentlich nur der letzte Song ""Underground"" entfernt an die Großtaten zu denen Eminem auf seinen ersten beiden Alben und teilweise auch noch bei der Eminem-Show fähig war. Ältere Eminem-Fans wissen sowieso wovon ich Rede und den Grünschnäbeln kann man nur raten, sich lieber die Marshall Mathers- &amp; Slim Shady Lp zuzulegen. Beide Alben zeigen Eminem auf dem Höhepunkt: wütend, witzig, wortgewandt, extrem bissig und absolut einzigartig."
2,"Ich bin großer Fan vom ersten GZA Album ""Liquid Swords"". Das ist vielleicht das Problem von vielen Clan Mitgliedern (siehe Ghostface, Reakwon, Meth, ODB...): Die lieferten alle ein perfectes Debüt ab und hatten später Schwierigkeiten, da noch etwas draufzulegen. So auch GZA. Nun gut, 13 Jahre nach Liquid Swords nun Pro-Tools. Gza wirkt auf vielen Tracks müde, monoton und lustlos. Oftmal klingt es, als würde er die Texte nicht mehr messerscharf durch die Lippen schießen wie früher, sondern gelangweilt ablesen. Die Texte sind super, die Beats sind tight, für mich stimmt jedoch die Deliverance nicht. Somit zählt GZA zu den vielen anderen Clan Mitgliedern, die leider nicht mehr an die alten Zeiten anknüpfen können. Schade."
1,"Und ich hoffe er enttäuscht mich nicht so wie bei seinem letzem Album. Doch ich bin Guter Dinge denn immerhin ist es eine Doppel-CD. Und nachdem ich Bonnie &amp; Clyde `03 gehört habe, sehe ich da absolut Positiv! Also an all Jay-Z Fans unetrstützen und kaufen."
5,war letzten Samstag bei DSDS und hab das erste mal Mamacita gehört einfach toll! diese Sommerlaune die wahnsinnig gute Stimme von Mark Medlock...das ganze Studio stand und tanzte. Freu mich schon auf meine CD die ich geich am Montag hier bestellt habe. Das Album ist bestimmt super.
1,"Ich zitiere aus einer Rezension aus rbb Kulturradio am Mittag: ""Nachdem sich vor etlichen Jahren die Mönche des spanischen Klosters St. Domingo de Silos dort befanden, ist es nun - gewiss mithilfe eines gigantischen Werbeetats der Universal - österreichischen Mönchen gelungen, sich mit Gregorianischen Chorälen in den oberen Bereich der Klassik-Charts emporzusingen. In sämtlichen Medien wurde die CD ""chant - Music for Paradise"" deshalb in den vergangenen Wochen heftig ""gefeatured"".  Schon der erste Höreindruck hat mich gleichzeitig schockiert - und gelangweilt. Denn man trägt diese Gesänge äqualistisch vor. Diese Gesangsweise hatte sich im 19. Jahrhundert eingebürgert und geht davon aus, dass ein gleich bleibender rhythmischer Puls konstitutiv für diese Musik sei, wobei der betreffende Notenwert auch verdoppelt werden kann. Durch Rückbesinnung auf mittelalterliche Handschriften hat man bereits in der ersten Hälfte des 20. Jahrhunderts nachgewiesen, dass dies eine falsche Herangehensweise ist.  Die Aufzeichnung der gregorianischen Melodien über dem Text erfolgte seit dem 10. Jahrhundert mit Hilfe der Neumen (griech. Wink). Lange Zeit hat man sie nur für eine grobe, umrisshafte Aufzeichnungsform der Melodien gehalten. Im Hinblick auf die Melodien trifft dies zu. Den Tonhöhenverlauf mussten die Kantoren bzw. die Mitglieder einer ""Schola cantorum"" schlicht auswendig lernen. Den Neumen eignet aber eine sehr differenzierte rhythmische Aussagekraft. Aus ihnen erschließt sich die Zeitgestalt der einzelnen Töne. Es ist eine sehr differenzierte, denn die Neumen unterscheiden - etwas vereinfacht ausgedrückt - drei rhythmische Werte: einen kurzen, einen mittleren und einen langen. Diese Zeitwerte korrespondieren mit unterschiedlichen dynamischen Werten (Betonungen) der Textsilben (lauter=länger).  Nur wenn man diese Vortragsweise zugrunde legt (die spanischen Mönche taten es bereits), kann man diese Musik historisch adäquat und für den Hörer faszinierend wiederbeleben, was die zeitlich parallel erschienene CD ""Gregorianische Gesänge auf Texte des Apostel Paulus""   des Independent-Labels CHRISTOPHORUS eindrücklich beweist.  Gerade diese rhythmische Freiheit ist das unmittelbare, singuläre Faszinosum der Gregorianik heutzutage. Erschreckend macht der Vergleich deutlich, wie leicht Werbung Qualität ersetzen kann."""
5,"Als Musikfreund macht man in seiner Eitelkeit ja häufig den Fehler, einer euphorisch besprochenen, überall präsenten und erfolgreichen Platte nicht mehr über den Weg zu trauen. Das muß man sich abgewöhnen, denn sonst entgehen einem Brecher wie ""Songs for the Deaf""! Das Album ist tatsächlich so gut wie sein Ruf und übertrifft meiner Meinung nach auch die vorangegangenen Queens-Alben. Das ist straighter, aber keineswegs glatter Rock, mit dem hardest working man of alternative rock, Dave Grohl, an den Drums in Bestform. Um die Qualität der rundum gelungenen Platte anzudeuten, sei hier erwähnt, daß es sich bei der beliebten Single ""No One Knows"" um den SCHWÄCHSTEN Song handelt. Und der ist ja nun auch alles andere als schlecht. Favoriten: ""Go with the Flow"" und ""First it giveth"", mittlerweile auch schon als Singles erhältlich. Einziger Kritikpunkt wäre das Konzept - sprich die Einbindung von gefaketen Radioansagen, deren Absicht (Kritik am Kommerzradio) mir zwar klar ist, die jedoch ausgesprochen unsubtil ausfällt (""Clone Radio""? Ist angekommen). Aber das macht gar nichts. Kaufen!"
1,"It's really too bad that Daniel couldn't have been advised to take a better song and composer to release as his single instead of doing the ""Best Friends"" thing (WTF???)and performing this POS as a compare and contrast exercise with his competitor.  Of course he could have handily won the vote with more than the 50.4% of the vote that he actually did if he had sung something else like ""Soulmate"", as he did for his first number. He nailed the complexities of that song like a pro. Now that he is a pro it is sad that he is starting off with a steaming piece of 3-chord Bohlen crap like this.   Of course, it might make the top of the charts because of the DSDS win and the RTL hype. And he might stay around for a while, but I'm not sure if he will ever be a ""Superstar"" - not if he keeps with Bohlen and doing this tripe.  But, his voice is actually quite good and more important, he actually knows how to use it.  Unfortunately, Bohlen knows how to use it too."
1,"Was will uns denn diese Geschichte sagen? Mutter Martin, die ihr ganzes Leben auf ihren 18-jährigen Sohn projiziert, erinnert diesen an sein Versprechen, sie und den Reiterhof niemals zu verlassen (das sie ihm als fünfjährigen abgerungen hat). Der Junge versucht sich verständlicherweise freizuschwimmen, kehrt aber am Ende  wieder ins mütterliche Nest zurück um dort für immer zu bleiben. Als Stallknecht, Reitlehrer etc. muss er dort schwerste körperliche Arbeit verrichten und verzichtet völlig auf ein eigenes Leben (Studium etc) . Und das verkauft uns das Hörspiel dann als Happy Ending. Eine solche psychologische und auch phsyische Last ist einem Kind/Jugendlichen nicht zuzumuten, noch schlimmer ist es, dass so ein Käse aus dem vorvorletzten Jahrhundert heute unseren jungen Zuhörern zugemutet wird. Was soll denn unseren Kindern mit so einer Geschichte vermittelt werden? Ich halte dieses Hörspiel aus pädagogischer Sicht höchst  bedenklich. Bis jetzt waren die Bibi und Tina Geschichten recht harmlos, aber es ist unergründlich, was die Autoren beim Schreiben dieser Folge geritten hat. Man kann sie ganz unironisch einfach nur als DUMM bezeichnen. Minus 5 Sterne."
1,"Yello waren einmal eine meiner absoluten Lieblingsbands, allerdings schwankte die Qualität ihre Alben ab der ""One Second"" sehr stark. Ihre letzte neue Produktion ""The Eye"" von 2003 fand ich schon digital-langweilig.  Aber dieses neue Machwerk hätten sie sich wirklich sparen können. Der erste Track geht gerade noch, vorallem wegen dem Funkygroove. Den Rest kann man sich sparen. Die Musik klingt wie eine Mischung von einer Software bzw. Workstation Demovorführung mit Loundge-Musik, dazu wieder etwas Gesang und die Monologe von Dieter Meyer. Alles total langweilig und schon tausendmal gehört. Es gibt bessere Bar-Musik."
1,"Michael Hirte wird sehr gut vermarktet. Auf Grund einer Rezension in einer Tageszeitung habe ich mir die CD spontan bestellt. Die Enttäuschung war groß, denn von Blues ist auf der CD nichts zu finden, auch technisch weiß Michael Hirte nicht zu überzeugen. Dann wär da noch die Stückeauswahl, absolut nicht mein Geschmack. Das hat man nun von einem Spontaneinkauf. Ich weiß, ich bin selber Schuld. Also unbedingt in die CD hinein hören."
5,"Dieses Album ist erneut sehr gelungen. Man wird von Emiliana Torrini immer wieder überrascht, da sie sich nicht auf einen Stil festlegen lässt. War es bei Love in the Time of Science noch eher Trip Hop, wurde es bei Fishermans Women sehr leise und entspannend. Nun ist es wieder etwas lauter aber nicht schlechter. Ihre Entwicklung ist hervorragend. Weiter so Emiliana! Doch bitte kein weiteres Jungle Drum! Torrini Fans, kauft dieses Album! Jungle Drum Fans, lasst die Finger davon, diese Musik ist anders!"
2,Seltsame Reihenfolge der Bands schon in der Sendung..und dann ist auf der CD nicht mal Led Zeppelin vertreten..dafür aber Pink...außerdem wird sich der typische Black Sabbath Hörer nur schwer mit den meisten übrigen Künstlern anfreunden können..
1,"Gerade ist mir das Freddie Mercury Album wieder mal in die Hände gefallen - zum Vergleich dazu die alten Sachen aus 1985. Conclusio: wäre ""Barcelona"" und ""Exercises in Free Love"" nicht auf dem ""neuen"" Album drauf, hätte mein Mülleimer schon längst seine rostigen Zähne an der CD samt Hülle ausleben dürfen... Das 1985er Album ""Mr. Bad Guy"" ist ein authentisches, wenn auch m.E. nicht so sehr tiefgehend elaboriertes Werk, das aber immerhin insgesamt stimmig erscheint. Das 92er ist eine atemberaubend fürchterliche Flickschusterei mit den o.g. Highlights, und einigen sprichtwörtlich zu verstehenden musikalisch-gähnenden Abgründen, da fällt es mir auch schwer zu glauben, dass die verkorksten Beats im betreffenden Jahr der Trend der Zeit gewesen sein sollen."
5,"Auch seine Dritte ist wieder suuuper - das sagt ein eingefleischter RC-Fan der ersten Stunde!! Schöner Swing &amp; Soul mit tollen Texten (meine Lieblingssongs sind ""Tabu"" + ""Für'n Kerl""). Nichts desto trotz ist die beste CD Männersachen! Nichts für ungut Roger, bleibe dir trotzdem treu!!! Wäre schön, wenn mal wieder was Jazziges von ihm käme bei der tollen Stimme......"
1,"den dieser zweite Versuch von Julia Hülsmann ihr Trio mit einer Sängerin zu verstärken ging glatt daneben. Nichtssagend, langweilig - einfach schade um die Zeit."
4,"Auf Pocket Symphony geben sich AIR durchgängig entspannt. Dieses Album passt perfekt für einen gemütlich, ruhigen Tagesausklang. Zurücklehnen und gedanklich abschalten. Dancekracher und schräges findet sich darauf nicht. Dies würde auch nicht sonderlich zum derzeitigen Air-Style passen.  Ambient-Pop für die chill-out-zone zuhause, groovy, jedoch immer mit angezogener Handbremse. Die Beats und die bassline sind eher langsam. Nie aufdringlich sind auch die flächigen Sounds und die passenden Samples. Die schön eingespielten ""echten"" Instrumente sind klar zu hören, und Airs meist etwas melancholischer Gesang passt sich perfekt ein.  Wer die etwas frischer wirkende Talkie walkie mochte wird wahrscheinlich auch von dieser ruhigeren Symphonie begeistert sein.   Die ""neuen"" Stimmen der Gastsänger tun dem Album übrigens an den richtigen Stellen gut. Damit entstehen keine ""Längen"". Wer gerne zu modern-entspannender Musik abhängt wirds mögen ;-) Sehr gute 4 Sterne"
5,"Christina Stürmers neuestes Werk ""In dieser Stadt"" ist wieder ein fantastisches Album mit toller Song-Auswahl. Perfekt, wie wir Christina kennen. Rock, der sie auszeichnet und gefühlvolle Baladen, die jeden berühren. Genauso wie auch die Texte, die vielfach von Gitarist Oliver Varga verfasst sind, ist dieses Album jeden Cent wert! Die Bonus DVD ist leider nicht so umfangreich, doch für Fans ein absolutes Muss. Absolute Kaufempfehlung!"
1,"Mein obiges Statement ist nicht nur eine rhetorische Frage.  WONACH geht die Suche weiter? Nach der xten Million? Dem Traumhaus auf der einsamen Insel, wo es keine Medien und kein Publikum gibt? Den Liebhaber für die nächste Nacht? Den nächsten Nummer 1-Hit? Hier präsentiert uns ein ausgelutschtes, abgenudeltes Deutschpop-Duo sein gaaanz neues Meisterwerk und die Lieder klingen so langweilig und kommerziell, wie es seit 2002 zur Norm von Rosenstolz gehört.  ZUCKER war schon schlimm, KASSENGIFT ließ nochmal Hoffen.....aber die Enttäuschung folgte auf den Fuß. Mit dem Chartdurchbruch wurde die Musik immer lahmer und die Texte immer unsinniger. Kein Esprit, keine Power, keine Frische, kein Ohrwurm, dafür alle Jahre wieder eine neue Veröffentlichung und die dazu passende ""sensationelle"" Tournee................. Schöner, belangloser, langatmiger und trashiger Radiopop, den nun wirklich keiner mehr braucht. Dafür haben wir die Band mit dem silbernen Mond, die Band mit den Helden und die Söhne, die aus Mannheim kommen ( um nur einige zu nennen...). Zu Anfang ihrer musikalischen Laufbahn spielten Rosenstolz noch in einer ganz anderen Liga. Kauft Euch das erste Album SOUBRETTE WERD ICH NIE , oder ein Äquivalent aus den 90ern, und vergleicht selbst. Rosenstolz ist t@t. Auf Wiedersehen, Adieu, Good-bye. 1 Stern."
1,"Singen kann die Gute immer noch nicht wirklich gut, aber es klingen eh alle Lieder gleich, der Alauf ist immer derselbe. Das Album plätschert vor sich hin und man denkt immer das gleiche Lied zu hören.  Ähnlichkeiten zu Linkin Park, und was noch schlimmer ist: kein ""Das Beste"", ""Symphonie"" oder ""Durch die Nacht"".  Die Band hat sich nicht weiterentwickelt, zumindest nicht nach vorn...einfacher Teenie-Rock, obwohl die vier eigetnlich aus dem Alter raus sind.Tokio Hotel ist da die erfolgreichere Alternative;-)"
5,"EMOTIONAL: Ok, die neue ""Kings Of Leon""...Erwartungen an diesen special act des (nennen wir's mal) rocknroll revivals hoch...oder eher sehr hoch! CD in den player...was? 35 minuten ist alles, was drin ist...na ja, was soll's!? Und dann geht's los. Erster eindruck...hmm, wahrscheinlich zu schnell hinterhergeschoben, daher auch die 35 minuten! Irgendwie nicht so catchy wie der vorgänger...aber geben wir ihr noch eine chance. Klar, die stimme reisst eh viel raus. Aha, die stelle klingt ja ganz nett...und die auch. Und dann noch eine chance und noch eine...und dann plötzlich nur noch eines: ""Scheiße, ist das geil!"". Und dann wird's noch besser und besser und dann noch die frage: ""Wie lange wird die CD den player blockieren?"". Na ja, zumindest die nächsten wochen! Und diese stimme..."
1,"Die Collection, bzw, die Songs sind ok. Die DVD ist das letzte. Wenn man die DVD in den Player legt, muß jeder einzelne Track angewählt und gestartet werden. Es gibt kein ""Play all"". Auf Anfrage bei Schiller hat man mir mitgeteilt, man habe es vergessen. Kann passieren, sagt man.  War meine letzte gekaufte. Dann wundern sich alle, warum alles aus dem Netz gezogen wird. Da kann ich mir wenigstens meine DVD so zusammen basteln das sie funktioniert. Schade für die 30€."
1,"Gods and Guns? ""Dead and gone"" wäre der bessere Titel. Okay, lassen wir die Diskusssion über die Aussagen in den lyrics. Mich persönlich stört dieser reaktionäre Mist sehr. Wer immer noch glaubt, Waffen seien etwas männliches oder gut und hilfreich, hat nichts verstanden. Und alten Zeiten nachtrauern,die es so nie gab... na ja. Alte Säcke eben. Traurig. Die Danksagung an die Soldaten ist auch eher peinlich, wenn man bedenkt, wer an dem Krieg schuld ist - nämlich die Bush-Regierung. This ain't my America? Da hat jemand Freiheit aber falsch verstanden.  Viel trauriger ist letztlich jedoch die musikalische (Fehl-)Leistung: die Skynyrds konnten nicht mehr selbst Lieder schreiben, haben sich also den ehemaligen Marylin Manson-Songschreiber geholt - entsprechend kaum noch Southern Flair auf der Platte, sondern Hard Rock-Geknüppel. Sicher keine Steigerung zu Vycious Cycle. Schmerzlich bemerkbar macht sich auch das Fehlen von Billy Powells Piano.  This ain't my Skynyrd anymore."
2,Auch nach zweimal hören konnte ich keine Highlights entdecken. Die Zusammenstellung hat keine Inspiration und viele Stücke erinnern eher an belanglose Fahrstuhlmusik im Kaufhaus. Als Hintergrundmusik gerade noch tauglich.
5,"Es wird wieder mehr gerockt im Hause Pearl Jam - prima, dachte ich, als die Ankündigung zum neuen Ablum kam. Und tatsächlich die ersten Stücke gingen gleich mächtig nach vorn. Natürlich sind auch ruhigere Stücke dabei, was auch nicht anders zu erwarten war und PJ letztendlich auch ausmacht. Besonders Parachutes, Come Back und Inside Job möchte ich hier hervor heben. Dazu ein Video (wenn man es so bezeichnen kann ) WOW ! nach 13/14 Jahren ! Respekt. Auch an Eddies Stimme kann ich kaum was bemängeln, immerhin darf man nicht vergessen, dass er eine der genialsten Stimmen überhaupt hat und das ""Markenzeichen"" von PJ ist. Diese Stimme erkennt man unter Tausenden sofort heraus und das ist was besonderes ! Nicht desto trotz ein rund um gelungenes Album, welches manche Vorgänger wie Riot Act oder Binaural doch um einiges übertrifft. Ach und noch ne Anmerkung zum Grunge, PJ ist und war nie ne Grunge-Band, wer das das behauptet hat Grunge nie verstanden und Kurt Cobain wahrscheinlich schon gar nicht ! Und TEN ist lange her - ne Band verändert sich, das muss man auch mal akzeptieren !"
5,"von pearl jam...lieder für die ewigkeit, die fast niemand kennt, natürlich mit ausnahmen...genial...fantastisch...ein muss..."
1,"Da hat sich ein Duett gefunden, das alle Bildzeitungsleser und und RTL2-Zuseher glücklich machen wird. Zwei Menschen, die irgendwie immer so wirken als seien sie gerade einem Werbespot für Haarpomade oder Feuchtigkeitscreme entstiegen, trällern ein ein belangloses und schäbig produziertes Liedchen. Das wäre weiter nicht allzu schlimm, aber es gibt Leute, die halten so etwas tatsächlich für Musik und geben dafür ihr sauer verdientes Geld aus ..."
5,"Wer hätte das gedacht? Nachdem die No Angels vor 2. Jahren ihr ''Comeback'' starteten und das Ergebnis ''Destiny'' SEHR ernüchternd war habe ich NICHT MEHR damit gerechnet, dass die No Angels zu alter Stärke zurück finden. ''One Life'' aus dem neuen Album ''Welcome to the dance'' (VÖ: 11.09.2009) ist der absolute Kracher! Sehr gut produziert (natürlich von einem US Produzententeam) mit vielen Beats und klasse Stimmen. Ein totaler Ohrwurm und heißer HIT Anwärter dieses Jahr. Als erste Single eine TOP Wahl. Macht Lust auf mehr und ist mit Sicherheit ein wahnsinns Vorgeschmack auf das baldige Album!!! TOP! TOP! TOP!!!"
1,"Ich bin wirklich ziemlich enttäucht von diesem neue werk ... Das erste album, tatoo, one step at a time und das duett mit chris brown waren der hammer ... Deswegen freute ich mich sehr auf das folgealbum und wurde ziemlich enttäuscht .... Nur Battlefield und vielleicht noch 2 andere songs sind okay aber der rest ist für mich ziemlich langweilig und öde ... So lala-Balladen und rumgeträller ... =( Schade, Schade ...."
5,"Zur Entspannung nicht nur im Advent hilfreich. Aber in der hektischen Vorweihnachtszeit besonders ansprechend und hilfreich. Wie versprochen, braucht man wirklich nicht viel Zeit aufzuwenden und die Übungen sind auch ganz einfach. Die Musik dazu, die Bilder und die Texte sind einfach wohltuend. Und die Texte kann man dann weiterschenken und weiterverwenden, z. B. für die Weihnachtskarte."
5,"Green Day sind zurück und das rockiger als zuletzt. Ich denke da nur an den großartigen Song ""christians inferno"", eines der besten Lieder auf dem Album. Aber auch für Abwechslung wird gesorgt, z.B. mit dem Lied ""peacemaker"", das mit ein bisschen country Einflüssen daher stiefelt . Insgesamt erinnert das neue Green Day Album musikalisch auch ein wenig an die alte Zeit, da es auf keinen Fall so zugänglich für die breite Masse ist, wie es noch bei ""American Idiot"" der Fall war. Green Day hätten nach diesen Erfolg des letzten Albums auch locker die Kommerz-Schiene fahren können, (Bsp. The Killers) doch das haben sie ""Gott sei Dank"" nicht.  Hier noch eine kleine Liste der bewerteten Lieder:  1.Song of the Century mittelmäßiges Intro, mehr aber auch nicht ""3 Sterne""  2. 21st Century Breakdown ""4Sterne""  3. Know Your Enemy erste Single aus dem neuen Album, meiner Meinung ein wenig schlechter als ""American Idiot"" ""4 Sterne""  4. ¡Viva La Gloria! erst langsam dann schwungvoll ""5 Sterne""  5. Before The Lobotomy super Songwriting ""4 Sterne""  6. Christians Inferno geht ab ""5 Sterne""  7. Last Night On Earth nett ""3,5 Sterne""  8. East Jesus Nowhere super Takt ""4 Sterne""  9. Peacemaker mal was anderes ""5 Sterne""  10.Last Of The American Girls wieder top ""5 Sterne""  11.Murder City Hammer-Teil wie das sechste ""5 Sterne""  12.¿Viva La Gloria? (Little Girl) wieder super Songwriting ""4 Sterne""  13. Restless Heart Syndrome wunderschöne Ballade ""4,5 Sterne""  14.Horseshoes And Handgrenades rockig ""4 Sterne""  15.The Static Age typischer Green Day Song ""4 Sterne""  16. 21 Guns Die schönste Ballade ""5 Sterne""  17. American Eulogy leider ohne Bewertung ist aber ein feat.  18. See The Light   fängt so an wie das 2. Begonnen hat und bildet den perfekten Schluss des Albums 4,5 Sterne"
5,"Hagen Rether ist ein Original und kein Nacharmer wie viele andere Kabarettisten. Sein knackiger Humor ist einzigartig. Leider ist er so selten im TV zu sehen, was ich nicht ganz verstehe. Ich freue mich schon auf Liebe 2008! Schade nur dass er in Liebe 2007 weniger mit seinem Klavier begleitet, das fand ich richtig Klasse. Dafür ist das Kabarett wirklich erstklassig. Hagen Rether ist deutsches Kabarett der Gegenwart und der Zukunft. Besser geht es wirklich nicht, der Hildebrand von heute.  Wem das Comedy-Niveau zu flach ist, der ist bei Hagen genau richtig.  Habe wirklich selten einen Kabarettisten gehört und gesehen, welcher das Publikum so mitreist wie Hagen Rether.  Fazit: Kaufen kaufen kaufen..."
4,"Was den Engländern ihre Katie Melua und den Amerikanern ihre Norah Jones wird den Deutschen eine Muriel Zoe werden. Jawoll, diesen Namen sollte man sich merken. Aus dem Jazz kommend hat die Hamburgerin mit ""Flood"" nun ein sehr feines Singer-Songwriter-Album vorgelegt, welches die musikalischen Wurzeln zu keiner Zeit leugnet, diese aber wunderbar mit Pop und Folk vereint. Die elf englischsprachigen Songs sind durchweg relaxed, mit leichtem Schlagzeug und unaufdringlichen Gitarren arrangiert. Wenn sie gleich im ersten Song singt ""this one's for you"" fühlt man sich sofort angesprochen und kann sich zurücklehnen. Muriel verfügt über eine warme, durchaus wandelbare und ausdrucksstarke Stimme, die vielleicht manchmal noch etwas zu zaghaft ist. Einige Songs sind einen Hauch druckvoller, bieten auch schon mal eine leicht verzerrte E-Gitarre und beschwingten Drive. Da heißt es dann schon sehr richtig ""I want more"". Der kurze Song ""Glider Pilot"" imponiert mit seiner sexy Mischung aus Banjo-Jazz, Swing und Pop. Muriel Zoe hatte bei der Produktion ihres Albums mit Marco Schmedtje (Gitarre), Stephan Gade (Bass) und Tim Lorenz (Schlagzeug) hervorragende und erfahrene Profi-Musiker an ihrer Seite. Handgemachte akustische Musik, die eine echte und qualitativ hochwertige Alternative zu überproduzierten Charts-Hits darstellt. Nach den Alben ""Red and Blue"" (2003) und ""Neon Blue"" (2005) ist ""Flood"" nun eine konsequente Fortsetzung ihres Weges und man kann der jungen, hübschen und talentierten Dame nur raten, immer weiterzugehen."
2,"Hey there Delilah,Summer wine,Hot summer,Vayamos companeros,Einen Stern (der deinen Namen trägt),sind die wirklich fünf grossen Hits auf diesem Sampler das sich Best of 2007 nennt.Fünf von 42 Titeln. Zählt man dann noch Fairytale gone bad,Frauen regier'n die Welt,Proper education,Boten Anna und Heul doch dazu.Die ebenfalls länger in den Cahrts vertreten waren. Kommt man insgesamt auf zehn Songs die eine Rolle in den Charts gespielt haben. Doch der Rest von 32 Titel, hat eher eine fragwürdige Bedeutung auf dieser Zusammenstellung.Zumal die wirklichen Hits von Rihanna,Ich und Ich, James Blunt, Mark Medlock oder Chulca Candela auf diesem Sampler fehlen.Ein Best of Jahresalbum kauft man sich ja in erster Linie wegen den Hits des Jahres. Das man sie auf einem Album zusammengestellt bekommt.Und nicht wegen irgendwelchen unbedeuten Füllern, die man eh schon längst wieder vergessen hat."
2,"Blumfeld machen Musik für selbsternannte Feingeister. Mag diese Masche bei Studenten ganz gut ankommen und die Texte oft auch etliche Weisheiten in sich haben, ist die Musik eben nur belangloser Schlager. Der wäre in der ZDF-Hitparade besser aufgehoben. Ich denke für Fans von Rosenstolz gut geeignet, aber ansonsten doch recht konventionell und langweilig."
5,"Zunaechst muss gesagt werden: ich habe weder Fitnessstudio- noch sonstige Sporterfahrung. Letztlich bin ich 36 Jahre sportlos und gluecklich durchs Leben gegangen. Seit einigen Jahren liegt die Balance-Aerobic-CD -Geschenk meiner Mutter- hier und ich habe sie immer mal wieder probiert und durchaus geschaetzt. In der letzten Zeit jedoch wurde mir klar, dass ich langsam mal fitness-maessig etwas tun sollte, fuer mein Wohlbefinden, Gesundheit, Gewicht, insgesamt. Nur wie dies tun mit zwei Kleinkindern und Vollzeitjob?  Nach der Arbeit, zwischendurch, je nach Moeglichkeit. Home-Training war angesagt, organisierte Sportsachen fielen weg, fixe Termine ausser Haus nicht machbar. Da mein innerer Schweinehund recht gross ist, musste auch Motivation und Struktur her. Mein Cross-Trainer ist eingestaubt und ich schaue ihn mir gerne mal von Weitem an, ich habe einfach nicht den drive, ihn regelmaessig zu nutzen. Ich brauchte Druck, Anleitung, klare Zeitrahmen, innerhalb derer ich mich anstrengen muss. Eben die Brigitte-Trainerin, was fuer eine schoene Stimme uebrigens, Kompliment und Glueckwunsch zu der Sprecherinnnenwahl. Optische Berieselung wollte ich nicht, wer will schon mitten im Situp den Kopf auf einen Bildschirm verrenken. Und meinen kleinen portablen CD-Player kann ich ueberall mit hinschleppen im Haus. So bestellte ich mir etliche Brigitte-CDs, darunter diese hier, der Titel faengt einen einfach ein :). Wer will nicht Fett verbrennen? Und sie ist -gemeinsam mit der wirklich tollen, aber eher gemaechlichen Balance-Aerobic- einfach das Beste, was mir sportmaessig je passiert ist (gut, das ist auch nicht so viel...). Nach nun 3 Wochen (je 3mal die Woche) Training bin ich soweit, die Fortgeschrittenen-Uebungen durchzufuehren, wenn auch mit nicht wenig Schweiss. Rhytmische, nette und gut auf die Uebungen abgestimmte Musik, eine sehr angenehme Trainerinnenstimme, gute Hinweise z.B. zur Selbstkorrektur und auf den erste Blick zu simpel anmutende (squats, Tuerrahmen-Liegestuetz), aber hoch effektive Uebungen. Diese CD war ein Volltreffer fuer mich, und zum ersten Mal in meinem Leben erlebe ich die Befriedigung und innere Ausgewogenheit, die einigermassen regelmaessiger Sport mit sich bringt. Fuer totale Amateure und bislang Sport-Hasser wie mich eine Offenbarung. Ich werde in Ruhe die anderen CD's ausprobieren, heute war das 1. Mal die Core-CD dran. Auch schoen und wesentlich anstrengender als vermutet.  Vielen, vielen Dank, Brigitte!  Diese CD und auch die anderen haben mein Leben veraendert. Ich tue etwas fuer meinen Koerper und damit fuer mich. Und fuehle mich toll. Fazit: absolut empfehlenswert fuer wohl alle Altersstufen, vor allem durch die beiden verschiedenen Level Anfanger und Fortgeschrittene. Immer und ueberall machbar, alles was man braucht ist ein CD-Spieler, eine Matte oder Handtuch, eine Stunde maximal nur fuer sich und hinterher eine schoene Dusche. Einfach grossartig. DANKE! P.S. Habe gerade Sport gemacht und bin sicher auch daher so euphorisch!"
1,Leider kann man diese CD nicht mehr mit den vielen guten Liedern der letzen Jahrzehnte vergleichen. Es waren guten Jahre - doch die sind nun vorbei. Ich finde das Album schlichtweg gottenschlecht. Keines der Lieder ist ein richtiger Superhit. Schade um die Kohle.
5,"Ein sehr gelungenes Album, wenn mehr solcher CD`s produziert würden könnte man auch mal wieder in einen Plattenladen gehen. Diese CD ist wirklich jeden Cent wert und nach kurzer Zeit lässt es sich hervorragend dazu jaulen. Die Onlinezeit bei KaZa steht in keinem Verhältnis zu dem was man da schnell und in Top Qualität bekommt. Ich empfehle einfach nur Bestellen und volle Power reinziehen."
1,"Eine CD mit einem Haufen Hörproben? Diese reine PromoCD ist wohl der größte Unsinn, den ich mir vorstellen kann. Bei youtube oder myspace kann man sich die und mehr Songs auch anhören (zum Teil in kompletter Länge). Was soll das nun sein? Was für eine Materialverschwendung. Direkt für die Tonne..."
5,...Soundtrack zu einem Film den es jemals gab. Auf dieser CD sind nur gute Laune Songs drauf die ich jedem empfehlen kann!!!!Jeder wird diese Musik gut finden!!! Also unbedingt kaufen!!!
5,"Also ich finde gerade ihre Stimme sehr gut und vor allem angenehm. Auf der vorigen CD sang sie ja auch schon, wobei diese ruhiger ist und somit die Stimme auch besser durchkommt. An und für sich ist dieses Album von Kaki King sehr geil und zum immer wieder Hören. Erwähnt sollte noch werden, dass sich die letzten zwei Alben von Kaki King ca. 50/50 auf Songs mit Gesang und Instrumentals aufteilen."
5,"Das Album Take it to the Limit ist ein absolutes Hammer Album. Jeder Titel auf dieser Platte hat Hit Potenzial. Eine wunderbare Mischung aus tollem harten Rock und super schönen halb Balladen, machen dieses Album zu einem absoluten MUSS !!! Das letzte Album Extreme Behavior war schon echt klasse, aber dieses Kunstwerk ist ein Zeichen dafür, dass Hinder es jetzt wissen wollen und zeigen möchten, was sie auf dem Kasten haben, und das ist ne menge. Für alle Leute die den 80er suchen, sind bei Hinder genau richtig. Cd in den Player...aufdrehen...und Rocken....gleichzeitig aber auch melancholisch werden bitte. KAUFEN.....UNBEDINGT KAUFEN.....dieses Album wird ein HIT....ein WELTHIT!!!!!!"
1,"Wie der Titel schon sagt, ist diese Bravo-Hits, wie auch die letzten 30 Ausgaben davor, nur für Leute bestimmt die keine hohen Anforderungen in Punkto Musik haben. Denn wie man weiss sind CDs wie Bravo-Hits, The Dome oder Smash! auf die breite Masse zugeschnitten. Somit findet Jeder wahrscheinlich ein Lied das ihm gefälltwobei man wissen sollte, dass das Niveau der Charthits (eigentlich in der ganzen Musikindustrie) stark gesunken ist. Also besteht diese Bravo Ausgabe in Sachen Lyrik schonmal garnix. Das liegt aber nicht wirklich an der Bravo-Hits sondern an den Leuten, die so einen Mist gerne hören. Aber dazu komme ich später. Hinzu kommt die Tatsache, dass neben dem bekannten Nonsinns auch noch Noname Interpreten vorhanden sind (mit den gleichen ""Qualitäten"" wie ihre Idole). Ein Lied, dass das geschriebene zusammenfasst ist ""Schnuffel"" von dem dämlichen Hasen oder was das sonst sein soll (übrigens natürlich auch auf der neuen Bravo zu finden). Fazit: Für Menschen mit ein wenig Geschmack ist diese CD nichts. Für Leute die keine feste Musikrichtung haben aber trotzdem nach Qualität suchen, werden hier definitiv nicht fündig. Vielleicht, im besten Falle, ein bis zwei Lieder.  Leute mit einer bestimmten Musikrichtung bleiben sowieso von dieser Scheibe fern. Aber für wen ist dann die Bravo-Hits bestimmt? Wie oben geschrieben hat es Bravo auf die breite Masse angelegt. Hierbei kommen entweder Teenager in Frage die keine Ahnung von Musik haben und nur Party machen. Hierbei definiere ich deren Party als eine Kombination von Alkohol, schlechter Musik und einem Wetrennen um Geschlechtskrankheiten. Um es noch ein Mal deutlich zu machen: die schlechte Musik kommt nicht von der Bravo-Hits sondern von den Interpreten. Und diese Interpreten haben Fans (die oben genannten Teenager) welche doch gerne einen solchen Kappes hören wollen. Also macht die Bravo nicht dafür verantwortlich sondern die heutige Jugend. Mädchen sind damit besonders gemeint."
5,"Dieses Album stellt vielleicht den Höhepunkt der Karriere von Rondo Veneziano dar. Es ist sicher das kommerziell erfolgreichste Album dieser Formation. Es enthält viele unvergessliche Lieder und bleibt dem angenehmen, melodischen, spritzigen Stil treu. Von 1980 an ging es stets aufwärts, und hier war sicher einer der Höhepunkte.  Zwar gefällt mir das Album Concertissimo aus dem Jahre 2002 noch besser, aber trotz seines hohen Alters (ist von 1987) bin ich die Musik immer noch nicht leid, da sie zeitlos schön ist. Eines der universal anprechendsten Alben von Rondo Veneziano. Unbedingt empfehlenswert."
2,"ach ja diese CD ist wirklich sehr schön. Da ich auch 10 Jahre im Pionierchor Weimar war, ist diese CD wirklich ein schönes Andenken an vergangene Zeiten. Ich kenne zwar nicht alle Lieder die darauf sind aber An die Sonne finde ich ist das schönste Lied auf der CD. Villeicht gibt es irgendwann nochmals eine CD mit anderen Kinder- oder Pionierliedern als die hier aufgeführten CD's."
2,"nach dem album und der tour (und den guten kritiken hier) hab ich mir diese platte gekauft, aber ich hatte echt mehr erwartet. der bester song ist noch ""the view from the afternoon"",aber der ist ja schon auf dem album.  ansonsten: cigarette smoker fiona : ja, ok, reiht sich halt so ein, aber er  gibt keinen anlass, ihn besonders hervorzuheben.  no buses: hört sich auf den ersten paar takten an wie ein schlaflied, wird auch nicht mehr wesentlich spannender. despair in the departure lounge: siehe ""cigarette smoker fiona"" who the fuck are arctic monkeys: der einzige der neuen songs mit dem gewohnten, erwarteten und geliebte arctic monkeys- sound, aber wäre er auf dem album, würde er wohl ""riot van"" heißen.  fazit ist also: die arctic monkeys sollten echt bei ihrem ""whatever people say iŽm..."" stil bleiben; soll nicht zu vernichtend klingen, aber ich kann dieser platte nicht überragendes abgewinnen."
5,"Zunächst einmal: Lese nicht diese Rezension, höre Dir Editors an! Das geht hier bei Amazon ja recht bequem, obwohl man ja leider die Soundqualität in keinster Weise abschätzen kann. Ich stelle mir das in etwa so vor: Gott verteilt auf der Erde Gußformen für perfekte Lieder. Jetzt müssen sich nur ein paar Menschen finden, die Instrumente spielen und bereit sind ein Stück ihrer Seele in dies Gußform zu legen. Dann ab in die Hitze der Lied-Backofen Proberaum und Live-Bühne. Gut durcherhitzen und fertig ist das perfekte Lied. Auf der einen Seite bekommen Editors bestimmt jede Menge Gußformen ab, aber ich vermute es liegt eher daran, dass die Jungs bereit sind ganz große Brocken ihrer Seele in die jeweilige Gußform zu geben. Für mich ist jedes Lied auf dieser Platte ein PopRock-Juwel.  Die Lieder sind nicht so wahnsinnig kompliziert aufgebaut, eher einfache Songstrukturen, aber man kann sich meines Erachtens wunderbar von diesen Strukturen tragen lassen. Eine Platte zum Durchhören. Und wenn sie zuende ist dann drückt man wieder auf ""play"". Einziger Nachteil, für den ich aber keinen Stern abziehen wollte: Die Platte ist eher zum leise hören. Von der Musik her ist sie natürlich eher eine Platte zum laut hören, keine Frage. Aber leider ist die Soundqualität eher mittelmäßig. Ich spreche nicht von einer Soundqualität, die man bekommen hat, wenn man in den Achtzigern Jahren vergangenen Jahrhunderts in irgendeiner dunklen Ecke des Schulhofes einen illegalen Livemitschnitt seiner Lieblingsband erworben hat, aber die Qualität ist echt nicht berühmt, was gerade bei solch schönen Liedern, wie sie Editors produzieren, ein paar ""Ach wie schade"" - Tränen die Wange herunterlaufen lässt. Wenn irgendwie möglich, dann die limited edition mit der Cuttings-Bonus CD kaufen, die Lieder haben es echt in sich (auch wenn die Aufnahmequalität irgendwie noch komischer ist)."
5,"Soundmäßig der Hammer was die aus den alten Aufnahmen gezaubert haben. Abbey Road kommt sowas von frisch und klar daher, abgesehen davon das die Musik sowieso völlig zeitlos ist. Der Gesang ist transparent und lässt feinste Nuancen in mein Ohr die ich vorher nicht bemerkt habe. Die Lautstärke und die Dynamik wurden angehoben wovon letzteres insbesondere die Instrumente stark profitieren. Der Höfner Bass von Paul knurrt als ob er direkt neben mir auf der Couch spielen würde. Auch das Booklet, die Fotos und die Mini Doku`s sind ein toller Bonus. Man hat nicht das Gefühl eines lauwarmen Aufgußes oder Abzocke durch eine Wiederauflage. Eine geniale digitale Überarbeitung mit toller Präsentation.  Ich hör schon wieder die Puristen...nicht original....blah... Lasst euch was gesagt sein, hätten die Beatles damals die Technologie von heute gehabt, hätte das Album genau so geklungen. Die Fab Four waren Innovativ und ihrer Zeit immer vorraus gewesen. Leute kauft euch diese neuen CD`s. Die Liebe zur Beatles Musik war das beste was mein Vater mir gegeben hat. Danke Papa!"
5,"Also, ich habe das Musical leider noch nicht gesehen, aber die Musik und die Texte sind der Hammer... Ich finde nur Schade das keine Texte dabei sind für diesen Pres hätte man das erwarten können aber egal ... die Lieder machen lust auf mehr..."
4,Also ich habe mir nach langer Zeit wieder mal ne Bravo Hits CD gekauft und muss wirklich sagen ich bin nicht enttäuscht worden. Wäre nur jede Ausgabe der Bravo Hits mit so guter Musik ausgestattet. In diesem Sinne liebe Bravo Hits-Producer macht weiter so!!!!!
5,"Mit Cuban Linx ist den beiden Wu-Tang Mitgliedern ohne zweifel ein weiterer Wu-Tang Meilenstein im HipHop Olymp gelungen! Die Platte wird von den Beats und rhymes des RZA's geführt und ist dadurch noch mehr empfehlenswert! Die Mischung aus Mexican Cream und American Hard core Ghetto wird hier perfekt in einem Album gekoppelt! Ice Cream ist auf dieser Platte ohne zweifel das Highlight und der bisherige höhepunkt von Chef Raekwon! Jedoch ist zu bedenken,das die Beats dieser Platte enorm süchtig machen können!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Ähmm, also ich kenne ein paar Sachen von D-Bo, aber da es ja schon ein Video gibt, ist mir eine Rezension gestattet :D. Und ich muss sagen WTF is that. Das ist kein Rap, das ist unrhytmisches Erzählen. D-Bo hat einfach keinen Flow und NULL Technik. Natürlich bringt er eine Message rüber, aber macht ihn das zu einem bessern Künstler??? Ich denke nicht, eine Message ist ja schön ungut, aber nicht wenn ich, um sie zu erhalten Ohrenkrebs bekommen muss. Ich kenne zwar nur ein Video, aber diese Platte ist MÜLL, jeder zweite Untergrundrapper kann das besser."
5,"Was kann man nur da zu sagen. Sonny Black und Frank White sind Back und Presentieren die erste Single auskoplung von CCN II. Der Song ist einfach nur der Hammer. Der Text von den beiden einfach klasse. Ich finde es eine gute Idee den Song über ihre Freundschaft, Hass und bis heute zu rappen. Fler kommt aus sich richtig raus.  Wo ich dachte, dass soll Fler sein. Mann könnte schon sagen, es war eine Perfekte Idee Aggro Berlin zu verlassen. Zu Bushido kann man nichts sagen, wie immer Top. Der Beat ist einfach Hammer. Das der Beat eigendlich für sein Soundtrack zum Film,, Zeiten Ändern Sich,, gedacht war. Kann man einfach nur sagen Perfekt. Wen die Single Genial ist wird das Kollabo Album Perfekt. EGJ 4ever"
5,"Zum Produkt ansich: Yeah, das war ja eh klar, dass der Maestro irgendwie, irgendwo, irgendwann eine GH Scheibe raushaut, war wohl nur eine Frage der Zeit. Das ist schon OK, gehört halt irgendwie zum Biz dazu, wies scheint. Ein Fan wie ich, der bereits jede Scheibe von ihm hat, wird auf die Sammlung der ganz großen Hits vom meister natürlich dankend verzichten können, hehe ^^ Aber worauf man unter KEINEN UMSTÄNDEN verzichten kann, unmöglich, sind die goldenen 3 neuen Songs ""When IŽm gone"", die ultrapersönliche Gänsehautsingle, wenn auch mittlerweile vlt etwas übergehört, zumindest ich ^^, dann noch ""Fack"" (FACK, nicht F***, hehe ^^), wo er seine komische Seite zur Genüge zum Ausdruck bringt, und ""Shake that ass"" feat. Nate Dogg, dem bekanntlichen Feature King, mit welcher Nummer man dem Index schon wieder näher rückt... Dank der 3 genannten Monsterburner: KAUFEN!!!"
5,Ich möchte gerne zu jedem song dieses einzigartigem Debuts von Nightwish ein kleines fazit schreiben.. doch vorher möchte ich sagen: diese cd ist ein wahres meisterwerk! ausserdem ist es wirklich hörenswert wie die band nightwish in den anfängen ihrer karriere gespielt haben! also.....
5,"Und wieder haben Nightwish es geschafft, mich in ihren Bann zu ziehen, auch wenn es diesmal zugegeben etwas laenger gedauert hat. Wie fuer viele andere Hoerer hat es auch bei mir ein paar Durchlaeufe gedauert, ehe dieses Album seine volle Pracht entfaltet hat. Dabei sind die Zutaten bewaehrt geblieben: Tarjas goettliche Stimme, Tuomas virtuoses Keybordspiel, dass nach wie vor von majestaetisch stampfend bis hin zu schwindelerregend schnellen Melodien reicht, Empu sorgt fuer den harten Kontrast auf der E-Gitarre, und die Rythmusfraktion setzt das alles auf ein solide ballerndes Fundament. Das Neuzugang Marco am Bass auch mal singen darf, empfinde ich persoenlich als angenehme Bereicherung des Nighwish Sounds. Es musste was passieren, ansonsten haette die Gefahr bestanden, ein weiteres ""Wishmaster"" zu produzieren, und bei aller Liebe zu diesem Album, Nightwish sind meiner Meinung nach zu schade fuer die vielbeschriebene ""Stagnation auf hohem Level"". ""Slaying the dreamer"" ist zwar wirklich das haerteste, was die Gruppe je abgeliefert hat, insgesamt ist der Song jedoch absolut hoerbar und passt sich sehr gut an die Thematik des Textes (Unschuld zerbricht an der Welt) an. Ach ja, die Texte. Hier liegt fuer mich vielleicht der einzige Kritikpunkt des Albums, denn diesmal regiert wirklich die tiefste Depression. Bei aller Ehrfurcht vor dem Einblick, den Tuomas hier in sein Innenleben gibt, ein kleiner Lichtblick am Ende des Albums haette nicht geschadet. Aber ich will nicht meckern. Nightwish sind und bleiben zum Sterben schoen. Danke, dass es nach wie vor Musik gibt, die mir die Freudentraenen in die Augen treibt."
1,"Sorry Mark. Aber langsam reichts mir ""Isch lieb den Dieder.Isch lieb Eusch Ihr Arschgeige"". Und auch mit der Musik vom Dieder reichts jetzt. Vier Alben im selben Schnullisound sind genug. Ich will endlich Deine Stimme hören. Pur, dreckig soulig. Das mir der Hintern uff geht. Aber bitte, bitte nicht länger diesen Schmarn. Keine Angst die Leute kaufen Deine CD`s auch mit einem anderen Produzenten. Oder gerade erst recht.  Eine geile Stimme wie Deine Mark Medlock braucht auch geile Lieder in die Du  Dein Gefühl reinsteckst."
1,"Das wars dann wohl. Nachdem ich bereits alle 19 Kuschelrock-CDs im Regal habe, die bis jetzt erschienen sind (einschließlich der Sonderedition zum 10-jährigen), wird die Kuschelrock 20 sich nicht dazu gesellen. Der Abwärtstrend der letzten Jahre bei der Titelauswahl setzt sich leider fort und inzwischen werden sogar Titel, die bereits vom gleichen Interpreten auf einer vorherigen Ausgabe enthalten sind, wiederholt veröffentlicht. Ich hab ja kein Problem, wenn der Titel von einem anderen Künstler gecovert wurde und die neue Version auf die aktuelle Ausgabe aufgenommen wird, aber so... Amazon hat jedenfalls preistechnisch alles richtig gemacht: Mehr als 9,95 Euro kann man für diese CD nicht verlangen, da die lohnenswerten Titel auf der CD nicht mehr wert sind. Armes Sony BMG - anscheinend kann man sich dort nicht mal mehr qualifiziertes Personal leisten, um eine anständige Jubiläumsausgabe der wohl bekanntesten CD-Sammlung in Deutschland zusammenzustellen!!!"
2,"Als die erste Kuschelrock erschien, war es eine originelle Idee;  sie war bepackt mit Rockklassikern, Popballaden und auch unbekannten Stücken, die dennoch den Zauber in einem geweckt haben. Bis zur Nummer 14 war alles in Ordnung; die Mischung wurde zwar mehr als unkreativ und manchmal habe ich mich gefragt, was es soll alte Songs wieder auf die neuen Kuschelrocks zu bringen, aber das Konzept lebte noch.  Damit scheint es aber vorbei zu sein. Ähnlich wie bei den Bravo Hits dümpelt diese CD-Sammlung nur noch vor sich her und hat gerade mal soviel Stoff, um eine CD voll zu bekommen. Mag sein, dass sich nun mal das Musikgeschehen geändert hat und somit die Musikszene viel vielspältiger geworden ist, als es in den 80er Jahren war. Aber das heißt nicht, dass man sagen muss: ""Wir bringen alte Hits rauf, dann kauft man sie noch!""  Was hat z.B. Marcella Detroit auf dieser Combilation verloren oder Destiny's Childs ""Girl"". Ich hätte mir mehr gewünscht, dass man auch mal andere Musiksparten aufgreift und sich an solche Sachen wie Nightwishs ""Sleeping Sun"" oder Leaves' Eyes ""Elegy"" rantraut, als alte Klassiker wie ""What can I do to"" von The Corrs wieder auszugraben. Dazu muss man auch sagen, dass es mehr denn je nach Geldmache aussieht, weil in Abstand von zwei Wochen kommt die neue Bravo Hits, Die Bravo Black Hits und auch noch die nächste Dome Platte auf den Markt. Aber wir sind ja keine Geldmacher und Halsabschneider..."
5,"Daß FIREBALL zwischen IN ROCK und MACHINE HEAD etwas untergangen ist, mag aus kommerzieller Hinsicht zwar stimmen, aber musikalisch übertrifft es die beiden eher noch - schließlich ehrt es eine Band eher, wenn sie nach großem Erfolg mit Hardrock-Knallern wie BLACK NIGHT oder SPEED KING nicht versucht, sich von da an selber zu kopieren, sondern neues Terrain zu erforschen (Country-Töne in ANYONE'S DAUGHTER, Psychedelisches mit THE MULE, kritische Longsongs: NO NO NO, FOOLS, Dreckig-Funkiges: NO ONE CAME). Also kein Grund, dieses Album im Vergleich mit seinem Vorgänger und seinem Nachfolger runterzumachen, wie es gerne geschieht."
2,"Wer die persönliche Ausdruckskraft der Lieder auf der CD ""One Chance"" von Paul Potts auch in den Liedern der CD ""Passione"" sucht, läuft Gefahr, enttäuscht zu werden. Der Zauber scheint entschwunden. Lebten die Lieder auf One Chance auch von der ausdrucksstark interpretierten italienischen Sprache, ist diese eigene Kraft der Worte auf Passione verflacht bis nicht mehr spürbar. Für Fans ist Passione sicherlich ein Pflichtkauf. Für alle anderen lohnt es sich, vor Kauf Passione legal hören zu können."
1,"Einfach, einen Teil von Kuschelrock, Schlager und Oldie Sampler zusammenklöppeln, mit einer aktuellen TV Sendung vermarkten, und fertig ist der neue Sampler, den es schon x-mal unter anderen Bezeichnungen gab. So gut wie nichts dabei, was es nicht schon mal woanders gab."
5,"wenn ich mir die CD anhöre fühle ich mich gleich in die 70er Jahre zurück versetzt als CCR mit seinen Hits in voller Blüte stand. Auf der CD hört man noch Hand gemachte Musik. John Fogerty ist mit seiner Stimme und mit seinem Spielen so druckvoll wie schon lange nicht mehr. Eine CD die jede schlaffe Party aufweckt, nur schade das hier in Germany von der CD nichts im Radio zu hören ist."
2,"Wie die anderen Rezensionen beweisen sind die Geschmäcker ja bekanntlich (und glücklicherweise) verschieden, doch bei mir konnten zum Glück bis auf Vier alle Tracks auf der (ewigen) PC-Playlist landen.  Doch ehe sie da auf gefahrlose und legale Weise ihren Platz fanden waren ein wenig Aufwand und der Einsatz von Go Back (Symantec) nötig, denn die CD schreibt direkt nach dem Einlegen in ein PC-Laufwerk selbstständig diverse Daten zumindest in die Registry. Und das unabhängig davon, ob man dazu beim sich selbstständig öffnenden Fenster die Erlaubnis erteilt oder nicht. Aber vielleicht finden bei Zustimmung noch weitere Dateien den Weg auf die Platte. Das bisher nur (soweit ich nichts überlesen habe) zwei Rezensenten von Kopierschutzproblemen berichteten verwundert mich da schon ein wenig, aber vielleicht wurde selbiger seitens des Labels ja irgendwann modifiziert. Meine CD jedenfalls wurde am 06.05.2006 von Amazon geliefert.   Auf der Hülle befindet sich auch ein mikroskopisch Hinweis, dass die CD sich nicht auf Macs abspielen lässt. Als zulässige (welche Ironie) Abspielgeräte sind nur Windows PCs und Stand Alone CD Player angegeben. Tatsächlich machte die Scheibe an unseren Playern (Hitachi und Pioneer) keine Probleme. Doch wenn ich die sonstigen Symbole richtig enträtsele besteht für alle anderen Hörmöglichkeiten eine nicht 100%tige Abspielgarantie. Der zahlende Kunde darf sich also als Testperson in eigener Sache versuchen. Grmpf!!! Zurück zur Musik: Pink liefert hier ein in der Summe sehr gelungenes Album ab, bei dem unter den abwechslungsreichen Titeln kein Totalausfall den guten Gesamteindruck stört, und das der geneigte Fan auch in einigen Jahren immer mal wieder gerne in den Player schieben wird. Zwar erreicht es nicht ganz die Qualität von Missundaztood, aber diese nahezu perfekte CD ist ja nun auch wirklich schwer zu toppen.  Bei Try This bleiben Dank Pinks fabelhafter Stimme auch die  musikalisch schwächeren Titel hörenswert. Die CD ist also auch gut geeignet fürs Auto (falls sie dort abspielbar ist) oder andere Gelegenheiten, bei denen man nervige Songs nicht ständig ""skippen"" will. Die Texte sind ebenfalls nicht alle ganz so gelungen wie beim Vorgänger, doch immer noch besser als vieles, was man sonst so aus den USA zu Hören bekommt.  Neben den 11 guten und vier mittelprächtigen Tracks (subjektiv gesehen) wird noch ein 16seitiges Booklet geboten, in dem alle Texte in Weiß auf rotem Grund abgedruckt wurden. Offensichtlich geht das Label also davon aus, dass alle Pink Fans über optimale Sehschärfe verfügen. Außerdem finden sich vier Schwarz-Weiß Aufnahmen und drei Farbbilder von Pink - alle in erstklassiger Qualität. Zwei davon haben bereits (Scans) den Weg an die Zimmerwände meiner Kids gefunden. M. E. zu Recht. Es sind wirklich tolle Aufnahmen. Fazit:  Eigentlich hätte ich hier vier starke Sterne vergeben, und die können alle Leutz, die diese CD nur an Stand Alone CD Playern abspielen wollen getrost für sich ansetzen. Zwei Sterne Abzug gibt es allerdings für den nervigen und in diesem Fall auch noch bedenklichen Kopierschutz. Wann werden die Label endlich begreifen, dass sie sich auf diese Art nur die ehrlichen Kunden vergraulen? Bei uns z. B. werden nur noch Scheiben gekauft, die wir nun wirklich unbedingt haben wollen. Denn unsereiner muss sich strecken, um die ehrlich erworbenen Songs im WMA oder MP3 Format gefahrlos auf den PC zu ziehen, während Raubkopierer, die sich die Scheibe z. B. aus dem Net oder vom Schulhof besorgen den Kopierschutz niemals zu Gesicht kriegen werden."
5,"Irgendwann im Sommer 1983 allein im Wohnzimmer meiner Eltern. Gerade die Scheibe gekauft. Die Sonne steht tief und taucht die Gardinen in goldenes Licht. Ich schmeiße den DUAL-Plattenspieler an und lege mich auf den Teppichboden. Was dann folgt, macht mir heute noch Gänsehaut. LSD ist ein Dreck dagegen. Mit ""Somebody up there likes you"" hatte ich mich dann so weit von der Erde entfernt, dass ich unter normalen Umständen Angst bekommen hätte - nicht aber geborgen im Schoß dieser warmen, treibenden Klänge. Schwer, wieder zurückzukommen - allerdings notwendig, um die Scheibe nochmal umzudrehen. Damals gab es noch keine Endlosschleifentaste ..."
1,"Die hier enthaltenen Songs kommen, bis auf das letzte Instrumental-Stück, nie in der Serie vor, noch haben sie besonders viel mit der Atmosphäre von ""Sex and the City"" gemeinsam. Einzig ""Righteous Love"" und ""Calling it quits"" haben Stil, auch wenn sie nicht ""SATC-like"" sind.  Die Compilation wirkt wie eine wahllos zusammengeschmissene Charts-CD à la ""Die Hits des Jahres xxx"", hat aber nicht den Charme und den bereits erwähnten Glamour von, zum Beispiel, Carrie."
1,"Es mag ja sein, dass in der Verklärung vergangener Zeiten der ein oder andere Song dieser Zusammenstellung ein müdes Lächeln hervorzaubern kann. Mit 'Zombie', 'Sailing On Seven Seas', 'Return To Innocence' und 'I'd Do Anything For Love' haben es dann auch 4 mehr oder weniger zeitlose Werke auf die CDs geschafft. Aber gut drei Viertel der Songs sind so übel und totgenudelt, dass es eine Wohltat war, sie nicht mehr zu hören. 'Sweat', 'Big Big World', 'Barbie Girl', 'Over The Rainbow', das waren die musikalischen Verbrechen der 90er Jahre. Als Maxi-CD gibt es für solche Schundwerke heute gebraucht nicht mal ein paar Cent, als 'aktueller' Sampler vermarktet soll die Kohle mit über 20 Euro fliessen? Netter Versuch ;-)"
5,"Nachdem ich mir die Scheibe in den letzten Monaten fast täglich (!) angehört habe, ist jetzt mal Zeit für eine ausführliche Besprechung. Denn ich kann die Jammerer nicht verstehen, die behaupten, Katie Melua hätte eine ""Piepsige Fistelstimme"" oder mache keinen Jazz."
5,Hab die CD Termingerecht zum Release erhalten und bin total begeistert. So wie man Ihn kennt und sich wünscht. Mitreissende Beats und Melodien gepaart mit geilen Vocal Einlagen. Für Trance Fans und vanBuuren Fans ein absolutes Muss! Mach die CD an und nie wieder aus :)
5,"""Du brauchst ein Lied, das dich begleitet."" (Rolf Zuckowski) Ich füge bescheiden hinzu: ein Lied reicht nicht. Zumindest nicht, wenn Rolf Zuckowski der Sänger ist. Von Rolf Zuckowski brauchst du mindestens 100 Lieder. Wer einen besseren Kinderliedermacher kennt, hebe die Hand. 1979 ging es los mit Rolfs Schulweg-Hitparade. Inzwischen gibt es diese Platte nicht mehr im Handel - es gibt nur noch die überarbeitete Version von 1994: ""Rolfs neue Schulweg-Hitparade"". ""Ich hab mich verlaufen"", das erste Lied, das Rolfs Tochter Anuschka mit 7 aufgenommen hatte, ist auch mit drauf auf den 5 CDs dieser elitären Kollektion. Nur wegen Töchterchen Anuschka hat Rolf übrigens überhaupt erst die Idee gehabt, Lieder für Kinder zu machen: er war so glücklich, das kleine Mädchen singen zu hören.  Dass mir unter den 100 Liedern leider ein paar Lieder, die ich auf jeden Fall in Rolfs Top 100 genommen hätte, fehlen, ist nur allzu natürlich. Z.B. das ""Lied vom Ball"" aus Rolfs nicht mehr erhältlichem Debüt-Album. Von den drei 80er-Jahre Tweety-Liedern (in denen seine Gitarre spricht) fehlen mir zwei: ""Ein Lied für Tweety"" und ""Zwei Gitarren und ein Mann"". Aber dafür finde ich zum Glück meine zwei liebsten Rolf-Lieder ""Dein kleines Leben"" und ""Wie gut, dass es die Sonne gibt"" auf den 5 CDs. Der Mann hat in den letzten 30 Jahren einfach soviel geschaffen, dass nicht jedes einzelne Schmuckstück in den ""100 Besten"" vorkommen kann.  Wer noch gar nichts von Rolf Zuckowski im Familien-Musikregal stehen hat (aus welchen unbegreiflichen Gründen auch immer), der wird aus dem Staunen nicht mehr rauskommen, wenn er feststellt, wieviel Wunderbares man hier mit einem einzelnen Kauf ergattern kann, und wie hell Kinderaugen leuchten können, wenn stundenlang Rolf mit seinen kleinen und großen Freunden musiziert."
2,"Also besonders dolle ist das nicht, was Till Brönner da abliefert vorallem wenn man sich seine vorangegangen CD s in Erinnerung ruft (mal abgesehen von der völlig verunglückten Version von ""But Not for Me"") lieferte er stets geschmackssicher und mit seinem eigenen Sound manch Track ab der sich seit Jahren immer wieder gerne anhören läßt. Auf Rio finde ich nichts was man auch nur im Ansatz als einen Höhepunkt bezeichnen könnte. Nur belangloses Plätschern"
5,"Die Vorabmeldungen waren unheilvoll: von einer schlechten Platte des Boss war da die Rede. Nichts da - nach mehrfachem Durchhören entwickelt die Scheibe wieder einmal Suchtpotential. ""My lucky day"", """"What love can do"", ""Good eye"", ""The last carnival"" und ""The wrestler"" gehen ins Ohr und machen Spaß, auch den 2-minütigen WDR4-Schlager ""Tomorrow never knows"" habe ich mittlerweile ins Herz geschlossen. Das achtminütige ""Outlaw Pete"", der Titelsong, die ""Queen of the supermarket"" und ""This life"" kann man sich ebenfalls gut anhören. Lediglich die Songs 9 bis 11 sind nicht meins, wobei ""Life itself"" für meinen Geschmack der schlechteste Song ist, den Mr. S aus NJ in den USA jemals veröffentlicht hat.  Alles in allem - und das erwartet man als seriöser Springsteen-Fan auch nicht - weder ""Darkness"" noch ""The Rising"" , aber jedenfalls ein schönes Album, das - hoffentlich - von einer weiteren Tour begleitet wird."
5,"Ich habe den Namen Pe Werner vor einer Woche das erste Mal gehört, als ihre neue Cd bei Klassikradio vorgestellt wurde. Ich habe mir das Album bestellt, weil ich den Titel, sowie die musikalischen Auszüge sehr ansprechend fand. Und - wow - ich bin begeistert!!! Die Stücke sind toll arrangiert und auch Werke von Bach oder Brahms wurden einzigartig umgesetzt und ""vertextet"". ""Tausendschön"", ""Der Mond in ihren Augen"" und ""Kugelmond"" schmiegen sich an die Seele und gehen zu Herzen. Diese CD in einer lauen Mondnacht führt wahrlich zu einem berauschenden Gefühl der Ruhe und Geborgenheit! Ich kann die CD nur wärmstens empfehlen! Mein halber Freundeskreis erfreut sich schon daran und ist hin und weg! Zum Träumen, Swingen und Genießen! Gäbe es zehn Sterne, hätte sie die alle verdient!"
1,"Gleich eines Vorweg: die Rezension dieser Cd beruht nicht auf deren Inhalt, sondern (LEIDER!!!) auf der Abzockerie von Sony BMG (für ein vergleichendes Beispiel sei auf Oral Fixation von Shakira verwiesen). Nur drei Monate nach Erscheinen der normalen Version bzw. der amazon Edition (die ich persönlich besitze) von ""Das Optimale Leben"" erscheint eine Tour Edition. Damit werden all diejenigen bestraft, die so dumm waren und sich die Cd gleich am Anfang gekauft haben und somit verantwortlich dafür, dass das Album (fast) an die Spitze der Charts schoss. Für alle anderen, die entweder schlauer waren und gewartet haben (abzusehen war dies ja, auch bei ""Unausgesprochen"" kam ja eine weitere Version mit mehr Tracks, allerdings nicht mit so vielen wie hier) oder es sich leisten können nochmals zuzuschlagen, ist die Cd natürlich TOP. Auf dem ""Studioalbum"" (siehe meine Rezension bez der amazon Edition) befinden sich vier weitere Tracks plus Videoclip und daneben gibt es eine zweite Cd mit stolzen 34 Live Tracks; dass Annett auch live eine absolute Sensation ist, habe ich schon einmal erleben dürfen, im Februar folgt das zweite Mal. Fazit: Für den Inhalt der CD natürlich 5 Punkte, doch leider überwiegt mein Ärger und ich habe mich für die Bewertung der Art der Veröffentlichung entschieden - somit nur ein Stern."
4,"Da es hier um die ""Special Album Version"", also die DeLuxe-Version geht, zunächst ein paar Worte zur Ausstattung.  Als erstes fällt die Hülle auf. Die Scheiben sind nicht in einer üblichen Doppel-CD-Hülle untergebracht, sondern in einem CD-Jewell-Case mit aufklappbarem Doppel-CD-Halter. Die Jewell-Cases sind etwas schwerer, als die normalen Hüllen, haben keine scharfen Kanten und wirken dadurch wertiger. Statt eines Booklets gibt es leider nur ein gefaltetes Blatt (ca. 36 x 36 cm), mit den Texten auf der einen und sieben Bildern plus Cover auf der anderen Seite. Die Bilder findet man auch in der Bildergalerie der DVD wieder. Die CD hat eine Lauflänge von rund 41 Minuten, die DVD enthält 3 Filmchen sowie eine Bildergalerie (auch als Film) und hat eine Gesamtspielzeit von ca. 14 Minuten. Auch wenn Frau Schöneberger unvergleichlich ist, so muß man doch sagen, daß vergleichbare Veröffentlichungen entweder weniger kosten, oder deutlich mehr Material bieten. Für das schlechte Preis-/Leistungsverhältnis gibt es einen Stern weniger. Andere Fans wird das ebenso wenig stören, wie mich. Über die gesanglichen und musikalische Qualitäten dieser Veröffentlichung dürfen sich Andere Gedanken machen, mir gefällt fast alles, was Frau Schöneberger so macht, diese CD eingeschlossen."
2,"...das fragte ich mich, nachdem ich Rebekkas neueeste CD durchgehört hatte. Ich war letztes Jahr auf einer ihrer Konzerte in Hamburg, und war absolut begeistert von der ausgewogenen Balance der Songauswahl und ihrer mitreißenden Performance. Unter den Stücken war auch ein neues namens ""Love may seem hard"" zu finden, eine schöne Midtemponummer die hier -wie fast alle anderen- in getragenenem Moll unter Streicherarrangements begraben wird. Das alles klingt unglaublich gut produziert, makellos...und absolut langweilig und musikalisch austauschbar wie selten etwas vorher. Statt verrauchter Klubs nun also vornehme klassische Musikhallen..ein Album mit dem sie ein neues Publikum dazugewinnen wird, aber einige (wie meine Wenigkeit) widmen sich wohl lieber interessanterer Musik wie z.B. Beady Belle."
2,"der erste Titel ist Programm:  ""The Best Is Yet To Come"" Ich muss ganz ehrlich sagen, dass ich maßlos enttäuscht bin von diesem Album. Nach der Veröffentlichung überschlugen sich die Medien wieder einmal in Vergleichen mit Frank Sinatra und wahrscheinlich ist dies auch der Grund, warum mein Urteil eher negativ ausfällt. Das hat mit Sinatra nichts zu tun ( Connick Jr. wäre da eher ein Sänger, der diesem Vergleich Stand hält). Liegt es nur daran, das es kaum noch Swing und Jazz gibt, und die wenigen Interpreten dann immer in den Himmel gelobt werden? -  Ich weiß es nicht. Im gesamtem Verlauf fehlt irgendwie der Tiefgang ( Me &amp; Mrs Jones klingt einfach nur platt und oberflächlich ) und ich werd das Gefühl nicht los, das das Orchester irgendwie unter Personalmangel gelitten hat. Der Funke wollte bei mir einfach nicht überspringen und ich liebe Swing, Jazz und habe auch nichts gegen Coverversionen, wenn sie gut sind. Erst gegen Ende, wenn der Feierabend in Sicht kommt, geht der Interpret etwas mehr aus sich heraus und rettet dadurch das Album vor dem Totalausfall. Sorry an alle Buble-Fans, aber 3 gute Songs am Ende sind einfach nicht genug :("
4,"Es ist schon ein etwas fader Beigeschmack mit dieser Veröffentlichung verbunden. Einer der Protagonisten, welcher dieses Konzert und letztendlich auch die ganze Tour geprägt hat, ist genau in der Woche der Veröffentlichung verstorben. Richard Wright, der Keyboarder und sicherlich das am meisten unterschätze Mitglied von Pink Floyd, spielt hoffentlich nun seinen ""Great gig in the sky"". Somit ist dieses Konzert jetzt schon ein Teil Musikgeschichte. Wie von David Gilmour gewohnt ist diese CD / DVD perfekt gestaltet und musik- und bildtechnisch auf dem neuesten Stand. Die Band spielt perfekt auf und erzeugt durch den Pink Floydschen Sound in Verbindung mit den gekonnten Farbenspielen auf der DVD eine Gänsehaut nach der anderen. Man muss sich aber trotzdem fragen, warum nach ""Remember that night"", einer wirklich famosen und sieben Sterne würdigen DVD, eine nahezu identische CD / DVD Kombie folgt.  Ich hätte mir an dieser Stelle ein etwas erweitertes oder abgeändertes Repertoire sowohl an Pink Floyd, aber vor allem an alten Gilmour Stücken aus seinen ersten beiden CDs gewünscht. Auch diese können mit wirklichen Perlen aufwarten. Alles in allem für einen echten Pink Floyd Fan natürlich ein Muss."
5,ich muss sagen die platte besitze ich selber und für mich ist es eine der besten in zusammensetzung von schwarzem und weissen blues auf jeden fall ein muss für jeden bluesliebhaber
5,"Wieder einmal war es soweit, dass Massive Attack ein Meisterstück mit einem Hauch Genialität abgeliefert haben. Man kann es klar raushören, dass sie einen düsteren Weg eingeschlagen haben. Wobei ich trotz der Selbstverständlichkeit der unterschiedlichen Geschmäcker das Album jedem, dem diese Gruppe gefällt ans Herz lege. Denn das ganze Album lang kann man, abgesehen von dem Stilwechsel die unverkennbare Massive Art erkennen. Atmosphärisch bis zum ""gehtnichtmehr"", Del Naja's fesselnde Vocals, Daddy G's tiefe Stimme gelegentlich als Kontrast, dieser Sound, der einen voll und ganz einhüllt und vereinnahmt, wie es auf diese Weise nur wenigen Künstlern gelingt... . Ganz zu Schweigen von dem guten Gespür für bewegende Frauenstimmchen. Und solch ein Trio sollte sich ja auch weiterentwickeln und nicht auf der Stelle treten.  Besonders wenn es solche Wunderkinder wie bei Massive sind! Bei diesem Album gesellt sich zu den Beats und Samples vermehrt handgemachte Musik hinzu. Beim sich mit Drums und verzerrter Bassgitarre langsam aufbauenden/aufbrausenden ""Angel"", stellt man sich auf die neue Spielweise ein, um dann bei dem darauf folgenden Stück ""Rising son"" in Erwartungshaltung zu einem Meisterhaften Album zu gehen, das zwar um einiges düsterer als die vorherigen Werke ist, man aber dennoch in (fast) jedem Song ein winziges Licht am Ende des Tunnels vor dem seelischen Auge wahrnimmt. Mit Plattenspieler- Nebengeräuschen beginnt dann ""Teardrop"" (wobei man gelegentlich, passend zum Namen ganz unwillkürlich feuchte Augen bekommen kann) und kommt natürlich als logische Singleauskopplung erwartungsgemäß direkt als Ohrwurm in den Kopf. Und so schnell nicht wieder heraus, wäre da nicht das absolut hypnotische ""Inertia Creeps"", welches sich vielleicht erst nach wiederholtem Hören erschließt, sich dann aber vollends entfaltet. ""Exchange"" folgt rein akustisch, strahlt eine für das Album ungewöhnliche Wärme aus und ist einfach nur chillig. In ""Dissolved Girl"" geht es dann im Gegensatz um eine Person, die aus Zuneigung zu einem anderen Menschen gerne vergisst, dass dieser die Liebe nur körperlich erwidert. Stimmungsmäßig fühlt man sich direkt in einen Film Noir versetzt. Und ""Man Next Door"" ist ein Nachruf auf die Zivilcourage, welche in der heutigen, eigenbrötlerischen Welt immer seltener geworden ist. Ein passiv leidender Zeuge eines allnächtlichen, handfesten (Ehe-)Streites, der lieber Wegschaut/-zieht, als einzugreifen. ""Black Milk"" groovt dann etwas monoton vor sich hin, ist aber keineswegs schlecht. Erinnert mich stimmlich (positiv) irgendwie an Portishead. ""Mezzanine"" spielt wieder mit Störgeräuschen und Minimalistik. Einer meiner Lieblingstracks, wenn überhaupt - ""Group Four"" baut sich darauf folgend mit Schlagwerk Einsatz langsam zum eigentlichen Finale des Albums auf, welches dann mit der Vocal Version von ""Exchange"" langsam ausklingt. Ich würde jetzt nicht so weit gehen und ""Mezzanine"" als ihr bestes Album zu bezeichnen. Denn obwohl es für mich ein klares Meisterwerk ist, kann man es nur schwer mit den beiden Vorgängern vergleichen. Am ehesten dann noch mit dem Nachfolger ""100'th Window"", welches den Stilwechsel aus Mezzanine weiterführt, aber von 3D aus diversen Gründen fast im Alleingang produziert wurde, eingängiger ist und technisch etwas anders produziert. Aber das ist eine andere Geschichte.  Wenn man sich auf ein düstereres, nicht ganz so leicht zugängliches Album (Mezzanine) einlässt, kann man durchaus gefallen daran finden und süchtig werden. Schade, das man in letzter Zeit nicht viel neues gehört hat und auch das neue Album ""Weather Underground"" (Arbeitstitel), mit einer meiner Lieblingssängerinen (Hope Sandoval) noch auf sich warten lässt."
5,"Geiles Album! Der allerbeste Song ist: ""Du riechst so gut"". Das Video ist fast schon ein kleiner Kunstfilm. Kult! Dieser Song ist unübertrefflich. Höre selten etwas, das an dieses geniale Machwerk herankommt. Rammstein ist eine super Band! Einfach großartig!"
5,"Dangerous ist ein Album von Michael Jackson das meist unterschätzt wird. Ich teile die Einstellung des Verkäufers nicht, so wie er sie in der Prodkutbeschreibung bekannt gibt.  Eingeläutet wurde die ""Dangerous-Ära"" mit der Mega Hitsingle ""Black or White"". Es folgten Superhits wie ""Jam"", ""Heal the World"", ""Remember the Time"", ""Will you be there"" oder auch ""Who is it"". Das Album wurde bis heute rund 31 Millionen mal verkauft und ist somit nach Thriller (60 Mio. Alben, 100 Mio. Tonträger)das zweit erfolgreichste Album Michael Jackson's welches für die Qualität spricht. Auch wenn die zugehörige ""Dangerous-World-Tour"" nach dem sehr erfolgreichen ersten Leg 1992 (in Europa und Japan) im zweiten Leg 1993 (Mittel/Südamerika) unter den Vorwürfen des Kindesmissbrauchs unter geht, bleibt diese Tournee ein Meilenstein in der Musikindustrie.   Des weiteren wird Dangerous von den Jackson-Fans (also Kennern) als dessen bestes Album genannt und nicht Thriller, Bad oder HIStory.  Produziert wurde das Album von Michael Jackson und war somit nach Off the wall, Thiller und Bad, welche mit Qunicy Jones produziert wurden, das erste Album das Michael Jackson vollkommen alleine aufnahm.  Co-Produzent Teddy Riley brachte zudem einen frischen Wind in Jacksons Musik welches bei einem Vergleich zu den vorherigen Alben klar zu sprüren ist.  Auch wenn für angebliche Musikkenner R&amp;B, Dance/Soul, Soul, Dance/Pop und Pop Rock vorkommen ist es für Fans und Freunde der Musik von Michael Jospeh Jackson der sogenannte ""Jackson-Funk"" der hier pur und in perfektion serviert wird."
1,"Die Aufnahmequalität ist leider ziemlich mager. Schöne Zusammenstellung der Titel, wer aber noch keine CD von Pavarotti hat, soll lieber zu bessseren Aufnahmen greifen."
5,"Was haben die Puristen nicht geschrien. ""Metallica verraten den Metal"". Klar, mit Alben wie Justice, Master oder Lightning hat Load nicht mehr viel zu tun. Das soll aber kein Nachteil sein. Es wäre ja ein Armutszeugnis, hätte sich Metallica in 20 Jahren nicht weiterentwickelt. Was dieses Album von den Vorgängern deutlich unterscheidet ist der bluesige Touch, der zweifelsohne durch Kirk Hammets Beteiligung am Songwriting zurück zu führen ist. Immerhin ist dieser Bekennender Fan von Blues und Old Time Rock Marke Hendrix."
5,"Als ich den Anfang des ersten Liedes hörte, dachte ich sie hätten ihn ""glattgebügelt"", wie das ja so oft der Fall ist beim 2.Album, wo die Arrangements meistens eintöniger werden....Aber beim weiteren Hören wurde ich eines Besseren belehrt. Auch hier hat wieder jedes Lied Single-Potential. Einzig und allein das Duett mit Nelly Furtado stört mich; muß es denn immer Nelly Furtado sein? Haben wir uns an dieser Frau nicht langsam sattgehört? Ich hätte mich mehr gefreut, wenn es eine weniger bekanntere Sängerin gewesen wäre, vielleicht sogar Eine aus einem anderen Musikgenre. Aber ich denke, dass es hier einzig und allein um den Kommerz ging. Das mußte ich mal loswerden. Ansonsten habe ich wirklich nichts an diesem Album auszusetzen, außer dass das 1. Album mir dennoch ein klitzekleines bißchen besser gefällt."
1,"Typische 12 Highschool Rock Nummern ohne Wiedererkennungswert und ohne jegliches Highlight. Das damalige Debüt ""The Better Life"" war wirklich ein rockiges starkes Pfund, aber seit dem haben 3 Doors Down keine Beachtung mehr verdient."
5,"liegt diese CD in meinem CD Spielder und verbreitet einfach eine tolle Weihnachtsstimmung. Hier paßt wirklich alles. Auch Frank Sinatra kommt nicht an Jingle Bells, Silent Night oder White Christmas vorbei, aber durch seine eigen Interpretation haben sie den ""Frankieboy"" Charme. Alle 14 Lieder sind wirklich klasse und nicht so verfallen nicht dem ""Kitsch"", vor allem ""The Christmas Waltz"" ist klasse und vielleicht auch gerade deswegen in zwei Versionen vorhanden. Anspieltipps: The Christmas Song, The Christmas Waltz, White Christmas und The first Noel"
5,Diese CD macht wundervolle Weihnachtsstimmung mit den Klassikern: 1) White Chirstmas / Sinatra 2) Silent Night / Crosby 3) Jingle Bells / Sinatra 4) Santa Clause is comin to town / Crosby &amp; Andrews Sisters 5) O little town of bethlehem / Sinatra 6) It's beginning to look like christmas / Crosby 7) Have yourself a merry little christmas / Sinatra 8) Silver bells / Crosby&amp;Richards 9) Christmas Dreaming / Sinatra 10) I'll be home for Christmas / Crosby 11) Let it snow! / Sinatra 12) Adeste Fideles / Crosby 13) It came upon a midnight clear/ Sinatra 14) Jingle bells / Crosby 15) Santa claus is comin to town / Sinatra 16) Faith of your fathers / Crosby 17) Silent night / Sinatra 18) White christmas / Crosby
5,Aus der Produktbeschreibung konnte gut entnommenwerden was der Inhalt ist. Die CD enthielt genau die richtige Musik für ein Dreamy Christmas.
1,"Wer ein ähnliches tolles und abwechslungsreiches Album wie die bisherigen zwei Alben sucht, der wird enttäuscht. Diese CD wird bei mir in die Sammlung der Staubfänger eingereiht. Seichte und langweilige Fahrstuhlmusik ohne Besonderheiten. Schade, Dido!"
5,"Diese Cd bietet so ziehmlich alles was das Herz eines fetten Brot fans höher schlagen lässt. Es ist noch ein recht altes album mit lieder wie Jaein. Endlich trifft mal ein Albumtitel warlich zu: Außen Top Hits innen geschmack! Dieses Album beinhaltet kein einziges schlechtes lied. Mal singen die Brote über ihre sältenen Arzt besuche dann über die versiffung des Hip Hops. Es kommt nie langeweile auf. Nordisch by nature( anspielung auf naughty by nature) ist eins der geilsten tracks auf der cd, da er noch mit so manchem anderen künstler wie eisfeld aufgenommen ist."
5,"Was macht man als kleiner Musiker, wenn man zwar gerade so ein Instrument bedienen, aber vom Songschreiben nicht die geringste Ahnung hat? Richtig! Man covert! Die meisten würden über altbekannte Melodien ein paar Beats legen und unter's Volk bringen, nicht aber BosHoss. Bei ihnen mussen es schon durchgängige Galoppiergeräusche sein! Ja richtig, die Berliner Jungs (sic!) von BossHoss verwursten Hits der letzten Jahre, so unter anderem ""Hot in Herre"" von NELLY, ""Hey Ya"" von OUTCAST, ""All the things she said"" von T.A.T.U., ""Loser"" von BECK und  ""A little less conversation"" von ELVIS, im Country-Stil mit dem allertiefsten Assi-Slang. Man kann sich richtig vorstellen, wie die Jungs auf einer Veranda irgendwo im Nirgendwo des amerikanischen Mittleren Westens sitzen, vor sich einen alten PickUp stehend und nur 'ne Latzhose anhabend, Tabak kauen, Bier saufen und die ""Klampfe"" schwingen. Rülpsen &amp; Furzen inklusive. The BossHoss mögen anspruchslose Musik machen, aber sie zeigen sich dabei im Arrangement der Songs äußerst phantasievoll! Wer aus BRITNEY SPEARS und den BEASTY BOYS Country-Songs machen kann, verdient auf jeden Fall meinen Respekt. Das Album mag nach 2 Durchläufen hintereinander auf die Nerven gehen, aber bis dahin macht es riesigen Spaß! Wunderbare Musik für den Hillbilly von heute."
5,"Halte gerade die neue Scheibe ""In Your Honor"" in meiner Hand und komme nicht drum herum...""The Colour And The Shape"" ist und bleibt mit weitem Abstand das beste, was die Foo Fighters seit Gründung zustande bekommen haben. Ob ""Everlong"", ""Monkey Wrench"", ""My Hero"", ""Walking After You"", oder ""Hey, Johnny Park!"" - hier reiht sich ein Klassiker an den Nächsten. Mein Tip: wer Rock mag und wem auch nur einer dieser Songs nichts sagt, der sollte das so schnell wie möglich ändern. Die wohl beste Foo Fighters Einsteiger Platte. Alles andere muss sich hieran messen lassen. Leider haben die Foo Fighter gerade auf dem neuen Album ""In Your Honor"" dieses Niveau nicht mehr halten können. Bereits bei dem immer noch sehr sehr guten ""There Is Nothing Left To Lose"" zeigte sich, dass sich die Lückenfüller auf seltsame Art und Weise vermehrt haben. ""One By One"" war dann nur noch geradliniger Rock mit einigen Lichtblicken. Leider werden diese Lichtblicke auf der neuen CD immer lichter. Die Foo Fighters bekommen quasi Haarausfall. Die können das besser und das haben Sie mit ""The Colour And The Shape"" bewiesen!"
2,"Wenn man das Buch gelesen hat und ein absoluter Fan der Geschichte ist, so wie ich, dann bietet dieses Hörspiel leider nicht sehr viel. Szenen wie z.B. die silberne Stadt, die 3 Portale, die Schlamuffen oder die Bildersuche am Ende fehlen komplett und lassen die Geschichte um einiges kürzer werden. Besonders auffällig ist auch die nicht erwähnte Vater-Sohn-Nebengeschichte.  Dieses war mein erstes Hörspiel und ich kann daher nicht beurteilen, ob es normal ist, dass so viel herausgelassen wird. Die Stimmen sind sehr angenehm zu hören und Umgebungsgeräusche nett umgesetzt. Für Kinder sicher eine nette Abendgeschichte, aber die eigentlich Aussage des Buches ist verdammt stark zurückgestellt. Den Buchliebhabern also nicht zu empfehlen."
2,"Roxette gehört zu meinen Lieblingsbands; die meisten Lieder von ihnen sind klasse. Wieso also nur 2 Sterne? Weil es langsam mühsam wird, dass sie eine Best of nach der anderen rausbringen... Sie hätten es besser bei der Roxbox belassen (wobei diese auch nicht toll ausgestattet ist, da etliche B-Seiten und unveröffentlichte Tracks fehlen, dafür aber X Albumtracks enthält, was auch dazu führt, dass sie überteuert ist) und dann im nächsten Jahr eine ganz neue CD herausgebracht. So sieht das ganze einfach nur nach lieblosem abkassieren aus... Schade"
2,Ich finde das dass Lied von Subway to Sally um einiges besser ist. Das ist nur eine billige Nachmache die ich keinem empfehlen würde ... wenn man eine CD auf den Markt bringt sollte das Lied schon aus eigener Kreation entstanden sein !!!  Danke  freue mich über Kommentare
5,"Was für eine Wiedergeburt von Alter Bridge! Da Myles Kennedy bei 'Blackbird' endlich selbst die Texte schreiben konnte (bei 'One Day Remains' tat dies noch Merk Tremonti, da Kennedy erst sehr spät mit ins Boot kam) enfernt sich der Stil erfreulich stark von Tremonti's Creed-Sound. Seine unverkennbare Gitarre bleibt aber selbstverständlich erhalten. Die Jungs spielen dermaßen gut auf und Kennedy zeigt, was er wirklich kann. Das mit Abstand beste, was derzeit auf dem Musikmarkt ist!!!"
5,"Fuer mich war ""B-Day"" das beste R' n' B'-Album aller Zeiten, also waren meine Erwartungen an ihrem dritten Album nicht sehr hoch, wie kann man denn ""B-Day"" uebertreffen? Doch sie hat es geschafft, ""B-Day"" ebenbuertig zu sein! Ich finde jeden Song einfach klasse! Man sollte definitiv zu dieser Edition des Albums greifen, denn die fuenf zusaetzlichen Songs sind erste Sahne! Danke Beyonce, dass deine Musik auf dem gleich hohen Niveau geblieben ist! Kaufen!"
5,"Übrigens das letzte Lied auf der CD nach 4:23 weiterhören außer ""I have a dream"" kommt noch was!! Viel Spass"
5,"Geniale Klavierklänge, bombastische Arrangements mit ein paar Folk-Elementen, intelligent-melancholische Texte, dazu David Grays sonore Stimme - das neue Album knüpft nahtlos an die vergangenen Erfolgsalben ""White Ladder"" oder ""Life in Slow Motion"" an. Einlegen, Lautstärke hochdrehen und sich einfach tragen lassen, bei einer längeren Autofahrt, auf der Fensterbank sitzend und in den grauen Herbst da draußen blickend, oder einfach bei Kerzenschein im Bett liegend. Wer hier Neues erwartet, dem sei ""Full Steam"" ans Herz gelegt, das Duett mit Annie Lennox, was beim ersten Hören noch fremdartig klingt; nach und nach gewöhnt man sich jedoch an die fast sakral anmutenden Gleichklänge. Ansonsten keine Experimente. ""Nemesis"" und ""Transformation"" gefallen mir besonders gut, aber auch die Single-Auskopplung ""Fugitive"" oder das ruhigere ""First Chance"" sind jederzeit gut hörbar, auch beim Putzen.  Ich habe mir die Deluxe-Version gekauft, weil ich mal hören wollte, was der Mensch live draufhat (wer Coldplay jemals live gehört hat, weiß, dass man bei manchen Bands mal lieber keine Konzerte besuchen sollte) und auch hier habe ich wenig zu beanstanden, ""Ain't No Love"", z.B. klingt noch gefühlvoller als auf der Studioaufnahme, wohingegen ""Sail Away"" nicht ganz so gelungen ist wie auf eben jener (und als Fazit gefällt David Gray mir live nicht ganz so gut wie a-ha live, aber man soll ja Äpfel nicht mit Birnen vergleichen). Also ich kann mir durchaus vorstellen, ein David-Gray-Konzert zu besuchen und das ist mehr als ich über die meisten Bands sagen kann (U2 können z.B. live ganz schrecklich klingen), mehr wollte ich ich nicht wissen und ich schau mal, wann die Tourtermine sind.   Fazit: wie bei einer Barbour-Jacke, einer Ray-Ban oder einem anderen Klassiker - bei diesem Album kauft man das, was drauf steht und das ist auch gut so."
5,"Lange hat es gedauert (fast 2 Jahre) und jetzt ist er endlich da, der Nachfolger zum ersten genialen Streich von Krypteria.  Und das Warten hat sich gelohnt, ich habe mir das Album gerade in voller Länge auf der Roadrunnerseite angehört und ich konnte mich kaum auf dem Sessel halten, was für eine Druckwelle, senationell! Natürlich habe ich sofort das Album (Digipack-Version) mit den Bonustracks bestellt. Was einem beim Durchhören auffällt, ist der unglaublich druckvolle Sound und die ausgefeilten Arrangements.  Die Songs sind, wie man es von Krypteria kennt, super melodisch (alle Songs) mit gleichzeitiger tierischer Härte (Anspieltips: Ignition/Deny/My fatal Kiss/Freak in me/Too late/Now etc). Obwohl man bei jedem Song sofort die Handschrift KrypteriaŽs heraus hört, ist jeder Song einzigartig und bringt tolle Überraschungen. Die Rhythmusarbeit (Frank und Cushy) ist auffällig variantenreicher als bei vielen anderen Bands dieses GenereŽs mit den brutalen Mörderiffs und Soli von Gitarrist und Produzent Chris. Der wirklich wunderschöne Gesangsteufel Ji-In zieht alle Register ihres Könnens ( von sanft bis Rockröhre ).  Hört in dieses Meisterwerk mal rein, es wird euch mitreißen!!! 5 volle Pommesgabeln für meine kölner Landsleute von Krypteria, ich gehe auf jeden Fall zu der Herbsttour!"
4,"Ich bin mit der CD super zufrieden, es sind alle bekanntesten Hits auf der CD die Michael Jackson je veröffentlicht hat. Es ist so, wie man ein Best of Alben erwartet."
5,"Nachden ich Henrik Freischlader zweimal Live erleben durfte nun ein dreifach-Live-Album von diesem begnadetem Blues-Gitarristen und seinem virtuosem Bassisten Oliver Schmellenkamp und dem Top-Drumer Dirk Sengotta. Die Band hat sich unglaublich weiterentwickelt, spielt auf Weltklasseniveau und haucht dem Blues in Europa neues Leben ein. Drei der Stücke sind besonders hevorzuheben : I Loved Another Woman (komponiert von Peter Green). Lonly World - ein unglaublich langsamer Blues mit sehr viel Gefühl, perfektem Timing (da wirken der Bass und das Schlagzeug) und brillantem Gitarrenspiel - ein ganz besonders Stück und mein persönlicher Favorit. Dirty Low Down And Bad - auch super. Fazit : So frisch kann Blues sein. Die beste Bluesband auf dem europäischen Festland bringt uns den Blues zurück."
2,"Der Soundtrack ist in einem Wort enttäuschend. Rachel Portmans unheilvolle Neigung, einzelne Motive, Themen oder gar ganze Abschnitte unerträglich oft, beinahe unverändert zu wiederholen machen aus dieser Musik ein kreatives Desaster. Auch vor den (zweifellos vorhandenen) guten Stellen macht dieses tumbe Melodien-Recycling nicht halt, was dem Soundtrack viel an möglicher Raffinesse nimmt. Für meine Ohren ist diesem Machwerk eine Komposition wie z.B. der Soundtrack zu ""Adams Family"" von Marc Shaiman, der stellenweise ähnliche Töne anschlägt an Orginalität, ""Pfiff"" und Dichte weit überlegen."
5,"Auch ein Star aus Highschool Musical! Eigentlich der einzige, der richtig Erfolg hat. Zac und Vanessa (Gabrielle und Troy) versuchen schon seit Ewigkeiten mit Songs aus dem Film in die Charts zu kommen. Ashley hingegen nimmt davon Abstand und singt einfach neue Songs. Und die schaffen es dann auch, wie man sieht, in die Charts. Der Song wird wahrscheinlich am Meisten von Girls zwischen 8 und 15 Jahren gekauft.  Generell kann man zum Song aber sagen, dass man ihn richtig gut anhören kann und dass er wirklich die Girlpower rüber bringt.  Und die beste Stimme von allen Darstellern hat sie ja sowieso."
5,"Ich will gar nicht lange fackeln. Die CD hat zwar nur 35 Minuten, aber da gefällt jede Minute. Viele andere basteln da 70 Minuten zusammen, wo die Hälfte für die Tonne ist. Hier gibt es die volle Kanne. Das nenn ich effektiv. Jeder Song ist da an seinem richtigen Platz. Sogar die längere Pause in ""Guaranteed"" macht hier Sinn. Zudem wird ein schöne Verpackung mit Booklet geliefert. Das ergibt zusammen ein schönes Gefühl, ja das Ganze ist ein rundes Produkt. Grandios !!!"
1,"Ich bin ein Pearl Jam Fan der erstern Stunde, hatte bis zur Riot Act alle Platten von Pearl Jam gekauft und Ten, VS und Yield gehören für mich zu den besten Platten überhaupt. Aber wenn man so ein großer Fan ist wie ich es bin tendiert man dazu, alles gut zu finden. Ich habe das Gefühl das es so manchem der hier seine Kritik mit 5 Sternen vergibt ähnlich geht. Nach dem die beiden letzten Pearl Jam Studio-Scheiben meiner Meinung nach einem Total-Ausfall gleichkamen, bin ich jetzt etwas vorsichtiger mit dem Kauf und ich muß sagen zum Glück. Diese ganze Platte hört sich für mich an wie eine Kopie von der ""Lost Dogs"" Pearl Jam Scheibe auf der viele ähnlich Balladen (vor allem B-Sides) drauf sind. Für mich Lichtjahre vom möglichen entfernt (bei dem Potenzial). Schade auch das Eddie es sich in den letzten Jahren angewöhnt hat mit halb offenem Mund zu singen. Das hört sich dann für mich immer sehr gleichgültig an. Ich bin wirklich keiner von denen die immer am alten Zeug hängen bleiben, aber diese Platte ist wirklich langweilig."
1,Also zuerst Lafees Stimme ist ja wohl absolut für den Müll und ihre Texte sind einfach nur Scheiße wer sich sowas antun will ist selber Schuld.Und  schade das man dieser Sängerin und diesem Album nicht 0 Sterne geben kann.
4,"Ein Muss für Eros-Fans und Liebhaber von ruhigen, gemütlichen Abenden! Eros Ramazzotti bleibt mit dieser CD seiner Linie treu, wie alle erfolgreichen Künstler, die solange auf der Bühne stehen. So mancher mag da neue Klänge vermissen. Nach meiner Meinung sind es die Titel ""La nostra vita"", ""Bambino nel tempo"", ""Calma apparente"" und der absolute Knaller ""I belong to you"" (Duett mit Anastacia), die neue Akzente setzen. Schade, dass die jazzigen Elemente und Improvisationskünste, die Eros Ramazzotti auf seinen Konzerten zeigt, nie auf einer CD vertreten sind. Da bleibt einem nichts anderes übrig, als eines seiner Konzerte zu besuchen!;-)"
4,"Mit ihrer Musik bewegen sich Phoenix zwischen klassischem Softrock amerikanischer Prägung und Britpop. Darüber hinaus besitzt Sänger Thomas Mars nicht einmal einen französischen Akzent. Ganz schön global.  Ihren Retrostyle haben sie auf ihrem dritten Album zugunsten einer zackigeren Gangart Richtung Indie-Popsong verlagert. Schon der Opener ""Napoleon Says"" (wenigstens etwas Frankreich auf diesem Album) oder ""Sometimes In A Fall"" warten mit wirklich grossen Melodien auf.  Oder ""Consolation Price"" oder ""Long Distance Call"" haben mit ihrem 60s Anklang und ihren Handclaps das Zeug zum privaten Sommerhit. Auch wenn das Album am Ende an Dynamik nachlässt - insbesondere mit seinem laschen Instrumental ""North"" - ist es insgesamt doch ein mehr als gelungenes Werk mit vielen tollen Uptemposongs."
2,"Von  Susanne Gryhius ""Motzi"" (hannover) - alle meine Rezensionen ansehen  da ist es doch wieder das Gänsehautfeeling beim hören.Einfach wunderschön anzuhören.  Nur weiter so :o))))"
5,"Alicia Moore alias P!nk ist schon eine großartige Sängerin. Was sie im Laufe ihrer Karriere den Fans geboten hat, ist vielseitig und absolute Spitze. Mit dem Album ""I'm not Dead"" hat sie wieder richtig durchgestartet, jede Single ein Erfolg. Es gab wunderschöne Balladen (wie WHO KNEW) aber auch coole Gute Laune Nummern wie ""Stupid Girls"". Was auch immer P!nk singt, es wird ein Erfolg. Denn Album und die Singles daraus waren sehr erfolgreich. Und jetzt ist sie wieder da mit einer neuen Single. In ""so what"" gibt sie wirklich vollgas, sie rockt was das Zeug hält. Ein wirklich cooler Rock Sound, ein toller Text und dazu Alicias großartige Stimme. Damit macht sie jeden Song zu einem Megahit, man hört sofort raus, das sie es singt. Das Video ist ebenfalls wieder großartig gelungen, es ist der P!nk Stil!  Es ist lustig, rockig und einfach nur P!nk! So lieben wir P!nk. Ich bin mir sicher, dieser Hit wird es weit in die Charts schaffen!"
1,"Ich habe noch nie so einen langweiligen, unmotivierten Schrott gehört wie ""Womanizer""! Dieser Song hat einen derartigen Nervfaktor, dass das Leben jeder Stereoanlage gefährdet ist sobald man diese CD einlegt! Ich dachte, dass es nicht mehr schlechter geht, als die Auskopplungen ihres vorigen Albums, aber es geht noch schlechter! Wenn sie nicht Britney Spears wäre, dann würde dieser Song floppen...und zwar völlig verdient! Was einem hier für ein Pop-Schrott geboten wird, ist schon fast eine Frechheit!"
2,"Die Pussycat Dolls waren ursprünglich eine hippe Stripshow. Nach dem Debütalbum PCD und gelungen Singles wie Don't cha und Buttons fanden sie auch in Europa Aufmerksamkeit. Der Nachfolger Doll Domination ist ein Rückschritt. Was helfen Videos und Shows mit sexy Lack- und Latex-Outfits, wenn die Musik langweilig ist. Warum singt nur Nicole Scherzinger und der Rest der Dolls darf nur tanzen? Eine echte Band ist das nicht.  Pussycat Dolls lieber live oder als Video ansehen. Die Pussycat Dolls werden bald vergessen sein, wenn keine weiteren Songs wie Don't cha, I don't need a man oder Beep folgen. Das der Song Baby Love, der für das Soloalbum von Nicole Scherzinger geplant war, das dann doch nicht veröffentlicht wurde, zeigt dann doch ganz gut wozu die Dolls da sind: um mit ihrem Aussehen Songs zu verkaufen, die sich nicht verkaufen würden, wenn man den Erotik-Faktor abzieht. Sie sind wieder da wo sie angefangen haben. Eine Stripshow. Anders als Christina Aguileras Album Stripped ist das aber nicht doppeldeutig gemeint, hier gibt es keine Einblicke ins Seelenleben sondern nur viel nackte Haut. Ziemlich plump.  Anspieltipps: Bottle Pop, I hate this part, Baby Love"
1,wenn man sich die anderen Popstars-Gruppen anguckt... kein Vergleich... wartet auf die Alben der TvTotal-Castingshow da bekommt ihr Qualität. das hier ist total öde!
5,"So, es ist also endlich draußen: Das lang erwartete 2. Album von Monrose, und damit stellen sie ein für alle mal klar, dass sie absolut keine (!!) Eintagsfliegen sind, wie die meisten anderen Castingstars. Dieses Album bietet die perfekte Mischung: Wunderschöne Balladen, einige Mid-Tempo-Nummern und natürlich super Dance-Songs, bei denen man einfach nicht still sitzen kann (so geht es zumindest mir). Meine Lieblingssongs auf dem Album: Dangerous, Strictly Physical, Just like that, Rebound, What you don't know. Aber eigentlch sind alle klasse, auch das Monrose theme ist cool. Also, alles in Allem eine sehr gute CD, es lohnt sich, zuzugreifen! Lg"
4,"...geben sich die Jungs von All-American Rejects. Das wichtigste zuerst: die neue Scheibe ""When The World comes Down"" ist nicht schlecht. Die Songs bieten eingängige Melodien und einfache Rhythmen und sind z.T. verfeinert mit Klavier oder Streichern. Am ehesten an frühere Titel erinnern ""Gives You Hell"" oder ""Real World"". Das auch mal ruhige Töne drin sind, zeigen die Ballade ""Mona Lisa"" oder die Klavierbegleitung in ""Back to Me"". Insgesamt bietet das Album eine leicht verdauliche Sammlung angenehm fröhlicher Titel. Das neue Werk macht All-American Rejects zu einer mainstreamtauglichen Pop-Rock-Truppe. Was allerdings auch bedeutet, dass ""When The World comes Down"" leider etwas glattgezogen wirkt. Mit Alternativ-Rock hat das nicht mehr viel zu tun. Ohne Ecken und Kanten präsentieren sich die Jungs ganz anders als bei früheren Veröffentlichungen. Mir gefällt das Vorgängeralbum ""Move Along"" eigentlich besser. Insgesamt lässt sich die Platte komplett sehr gut durchhören. Wirkliche Highlights fehlen allerdings. Ich gebe trotzdem 4 Sterne, weil keiner der Songs wirklich schlecht ist, weil einige Songs trotz allem echt Laune machen und weil ich tief in meinem Herzen doch manchmal auch ein Schmalspur-Rocker bin. Es soll ja sogar Leute geben, die Nickelback mögen..."
4,"Tina Turner ist eine der wenigen KünstlerInnen von der man sagen kann, dass sie einen unverwechselbaren, eigenen Stil hat. Tinas Karriere umspannt mehrere Jahrzehnte, und somit berührt sie auch verschiedene Musikrichtungen und zeitliche Einflüsse. Mir persönlich gefallen vor allem die Stücke ihres Comebacks in the 1980er Jahren wie ""What's love got to do with it?"", ""Private dancer"", ""We don't need another hero"". Tina ist wahrhaft unvergesslich."
2,"Kürzlich fiel in einem TV Beitrag über die Karriere von Fr. Bullock der Satz ...und als Sie dann auf Ike Turner traf, änderte sich ihr Leben schlagartig"" (man bemerke die - sicherlich ungewollte - Doppelbödigkeit die in dieser Formulierung steckt)  und wie wahr ist dieser Satz. Turner holte das Beste aus Anna Mae heraus, den Soul, die Verzweiflung, die Wut und alles war echt, weil auch so gefühlt. Vor allem waren die Aufnahmen mit Ike aber eines: gut gemachte und größtenteils zeitlos produzierte Musik. Das kann man von diesem Album hier, das allgemein als das ,comeback' Album und als Startpunkt ihrer erfolgreichen Solokarriere gedeutet wird, leider nicht behaupten.  Ja dieses Album es ist ein Startpunkt, allerdings jener ab dem die mainstream Popmusik der 80er Jahre anfing wirklich grausam zu werden, vor allem wegen der Produktions und Arrangement Standards die ab hier verwendet wurden - elektronisches Schlagzeug, Sequencer, Plastik Gitarren sounds, grauenhaft digital synth sounds, effektüberladene Arrangements. Was die Auswahl des Songmaterials angeht, kann man dem Album eigentlich nichts vorwerfen, denn die songs an und für sich sind größtenteils in Ordnung, allerdings nicht alle passend für Frau Turners Stimme. Das beste hier ist noch die Blues Deutung von ,Help' - wahrscheinlich dank der geschmackssicheren musikalischen Unterlegung der Crusaders, und auch Bowie's ,1984' geht noch in Ordnung, obwohl es dem Original eigentlich nichts hinzuzufügen weiß. ,I Can't Stand The Rain' geht sich dann schon weniger aus, weil hier auch Turners Stimme den song mit der Brechstange öffnet, anstatt ihn lasziv und anrüchig klingen zu lassen, wie es die Melodie dieses songs eigentlich verlangt. ,Let's Stay Together' grenzt dann nahezu schon an schwerer Körperverletzung, denn wie Turner hier die unterschwellige und leise Verzweiflung, ja Resignation die dieser song ausstrahlen sollte, durch Wut ersetzt - das hat dieser Al Green Klassiker wahrlich nicht verdient. Die Rock und Rock'n'Roll Nummern a la ,Better Be Good To Me', ,Steel Claw' etc. gehen dann wegen den vorher schon angeführten Produktionssünden gar nicht, auch war Turners Stimme nie für Rock geeignet, und wer jetzt die Rockgitarren bei ,Nutbush' als Gegenargument bringt dem sei gesagt: ja, eh. Aber das war eine Funk Nummer mit Mitteln des Rock gespielt, genauso wie viele Cover songs von Ike + Tina Rocksongs waren, die zu Funk und Blues umgedeutet wurden (,Whole Lotta Love', Come Together' etc.), und dafür war Turners Stimme perfekt. Ein Wort noch zum Titelsong: tolle Komposition von Mark Knopfler mit der wirklich versucht hat, Turner einen song auf den Leib zu schreiben, aber auch hier hat die Produktion viel kaputt gemacht. Ich würde dieses Lied gerne mal ,unplugged', oder in einem leichten Jazz-Kontext hören, ich glaube, das wär's.  Was danach in Turners Karriere an Platten noch kam, war oft noch viel schlimmer (,Break The Rules', ,Foreign Affair') und selten besser (,Wildest Dreams'). Am passendsten und überzeugendsten klang ihre Stimme immer zu Funk und R&amp;B. Deshalb war wohl ihr gelungenstes Soloalbum auch der Soundtrack zu ,What's Love...' weil der eben zu einem Großteil aus Ike &amp; Tina Nummern bestand."
1,"Das Cover und der Titel suggerieren, dass Meat Loaf und Bonnie Taylor gemeinsam auf dieser CD singen. Das ist aber leider nicht der Fall. Kein einziger Song wird im Duett gesungen. Stattdessen gibt es von beiden eine Art ""Best Of"". Es wird absolut nicht klar was die beiden, jeweils getrennt voneinander, auf einer CD zu suchen haben. Wer das Beste von Meat Loaf und Bonnie Taylor haben möchte, kann sich von jedem Künstler jeweils eine CD kaufen. Diese Zusammenstellung ist absolut unnötig und völlig deplaziert - Hände weg!"
5,"Sandra ist mit ihrem neuen Album ein Musterbeispiel an perfekter femininer Pop-Musik. Nix für kleine Mädchen, nein... reife, mit anspruchsvollem Geschmack versehene Pop-Musik, die wie ein sorgsam geschliffener Edelstein aus den Boxen kommt. Natürlich tanzbar, auch zum chillen, ganz klar die Handschrift von Klangmeister Michael Cretu. Warum nur verweigern die Radiostationen diesen sanften, rhythmischen Sound? Viel zu schade, um ignoriert zu werden!"
1,"Gibt's den Schrott, der hier versammelt und wiederverwertet wurde, nicht für ein paar Cent an jedem Wühltisch im Supermarkt? Unglaublich, womit man alles Geld machen kann!"
2,"Ich bin vor ein paar monaten auf ""blind"" gestoßen und war ein wenig überrascht als ich sah das die single auf DFA( von The Rapture bis LCD Soundsystem genial ) rauskommt . Nun gut hab ich mir gedacht ,als ich dann reinhörte wußte ich nicht was ich davon halten soll , Disco meets Chicago House meets Scissor Sisters und das alles kommt auch noch aus NY  das passt , nur sonderlich vom hocker hat mich die ganze sache nicht gehauen , ist zwar nett aber nicht mehr , selbst die Remixe von Frankie  Knuckles waren halt 1993 Warehouse Chicago house stücke  ....  Dann kam ein Album raus mit ordentlichen vorschußlorbeeren von seitens der Presse oder vom hörensagen . Vielleicht ist das Album besser als die ganz nette single . Ist es,für mich, leider nicht   . Klar wenn die Fachpresse zum großen jubel ansetzt wird es immer heißer gekocht als es ist . Man sollte mich nicht falsch verstehen Hercules and love affair sind nicht schlecht aber innovativ sind sie auch nicht , es gibt ein paar stücke die rausstechen ( Hercules Theme ) aber man verpasst nichts !  Meine Disco helden sind originale wie Giorgio Moroder oder Cerrone bis le chic und Chicago house war nie besser als anfang der 90er mit Armando , Marshall jefferson oder Kevin Saunderson und was die scissor sister betrefft , die mag ich einfach nicht ... Aber über geschmack lässt es sich ja wie man weiß streiten , deshalb gibt es von mir 2 ehrliche punkte !"
5,"scheinbar ist alles wieder im Lot bei den Black Crowes sprci Robinson's! Ein wirklich sehr gutes Album nach 7 Jahren Abstinenz. 2 Neue Bandmitglieder die sich hörbar sehr gut integriert haben und Chris Robinsons Stimme ist immer noch die markante Röhre! Einige Songs erinnern mich an die besseren Zeiten der Rolling Stones, Daughters of the Revolution etwa klingt wie Street Fighting Man. Das Album ist RocknRoll, Blues,Gospel,Rock und Country Elemente. Besonders gefallen hat mir der Song ""Walk Believer Walk"" einfach Klasse. Josephine ist eine Klasse Ballade die ans Herz geht.  Alles im Lot bei den Crowes! sehr zu empfehlen!"
5,"Das neuste Album DOMINATOR hat das MASTERCUTOR Album knapp geschlagen wie ich finde. Auf diesem Album bekommt man alles was auf den bisherigen Alben auf denen Udo Dirkschneider zu hören ist, in einem frischen Mix geliefert. Nach dem starken Album HOLY ging es kurz Soundmäßig bergab. Das gute Album MISSION NoX wurde dann von MASTERCUTOR in den Schatten gestellt. Dieser etwas modernere Sound hat in meinen Augen der Band nicht geschadet, sondern sie wieder viel abwechslungsreicher und unberechenbarer gemacht. Weiter so. Hoffentlich noch lange. Kann als ACCEPT und U.D.O. Fan eine klare Kaufempfehlung abgeben. Habe auch keinen sogennanten ""Filler""-Song finden können, den man mal eben so wegdrückt. ACCEPT wünsche ich viel Glück und hoffe nicht enttäuscht zu werden."
4,"Zusammen mit der ""Union"" Platte von The Boxer Rebellion sicherlich eine der besten Scheiben 2009"
2,"Ich hab mich gefreut wie ein Schneekönig als ich endlich die heiß ersehnte Cd bekommen habe.. Leider war ich schwer enttäuscht. Wer Mono &amp; Nikitaman schon mal Live auf der Bühne erlebt hat, kann von der CD nur enttäuscht sein. Die Lieder klingen irgendwie fad und holprig, Mono singt (IMO) irgendwie so leise und ohne Stimme und alles in allem wirkt es einfach langweilig. Fazit: Wer Mono&amp;Nikitman nur vom Hörensagen kennt sollte sich die CD nicht kaufen weil sie ein falsches Bild von den beiden zeichnet. Live sind sie meine Meinung nach echt toll. (Hab sie schon mehrmals erlebt)"
1,"Ich weiß nicht, ob Sies schon wussten, aber ich mache jetzt auch in Musik""!!!..... leider würde ich in diesem Fall die erste Alternative wählen, denn was uns hier Herr Hoffmann vorsetzt ist schon ein schwer verdaulicher Brocken.  Musikalisch lugt hinter jeder Ecke ein gewisser Herr Westernhagen vor, als wenn das nicht nicht schon schlimm genug wäre, wird hier teilweiser übelster ""Spreizbeinrock"" präsentiert (""markige"" Gitarrenriffs in öder C-Dur-Landschaft). Sicher locken die Texte den einen oder anderen dezenten Schmunzler hervor, aber diese Mitgröhlrefrains ließen mich beim Hören während der Autofahrt mit peinlich gesengtem Blick dazu veranlassen, den Volumenregler leicht nach links zu drehen.  Die musikalische Produktion ist steril, klar und pikobello produziert, jegliches Fehlen von Ecken und Kanten und einer gewissen Kauzigkeit,lassen  hier nur pure Langeweile aufkeimen und das ist der Todesstoß für jeden Tonträger.  Also kein ""Hallo-erstmal"" sondern ein saftiges Kopfschütteln. Schade !"
1,"Nun ja, ich hab sie gesehen, natürlich nur im Fernsehen! Ein Spießertreffen der Extraklasse!"
2,"Ich war früher ein ganz großer Fan von Seal und für mich war das Seal 2 Album eines der besten und intensivsten Alben Mitte der 90 er Jahre. Aber leider hat Seal es meiner Meinung nach nie wieder geschafft so ein gutes Album hinzulegen. Man verstehe mich bitte nicht falsch, dieses Album ist nicht schlecht, aber es hat nicht die Tiefe, die Seal 2 damals hatte, zumal hier absoluter Dance-Floor im Vordergrund steht.  Ich finde die ersten zwei Lieder auf dem Album nett, aber mehr auch nicht. Sie packen mich nicht wirklich. ""Just like before"" und ""Loaded"" sind sehr eingängig und bleiben lange im Kopf hängen, wobei mir Loaded noch am Besten von dem Album gefällt. Die anderen Lieder bleiben mir nicht wirklich im Gedächtnis und hören sich irgendwie gleich an. Manchmal dachte ich auch, dass Madonna statt Seal gleich anfangen wird zu singen, was wohl an der Wahl des Produzenten liegt. ""Dumb"" packt mich gar nicht; vor allem der Refrain ist gruselig. Und bei ""The Right Life"" kam mir gleich die Autowerbung mit Heidi und Seal in den Kopf.  Tja und was soll ich zu ""Wedding Day"" nun sagen. Seal hat in einem Interview gemeint, dass er und Heidi viel zu Hause singen und er ihr die Chance geben wollte, sich auf einem seiner Alben zu verewigen und nur wir Deutschen immer darüber etwas zu meckern hätten. Das Lied Wedding Day hatte er extra zu seinem Hochzeitstag geschrieben. Das ist ja nun eine nette Geste eines Musikers, aber warum kann das nicht einfach eine Privatsache zwischen Heidi und Seal bleiben? Schliesslich nehmen andere Sänger mit ihren Frauen ja auch nicht einfach ein Lied auf, nur weil sie die Möglichkeit haben, dies zu tun. Und wenn doch, dann sollte die andere Person auch wenigstens etwas singen können. Ich finde, das Lied hätte man sich sparen können. Einzig und allein ""Rolling"" ist ein Lied, was mich an Seal 2 erinnert und wo genau die Art des Gesangs von Seal hervor kommt, die alle damals so gepackt hat. Warum gibt es nur so wenig Lieder in dieser Art auf dem Album? Selbst das letzte Album, was noch mit Trevor Horn zusammen produziert wurde, war noch besser, als dieses Album. Sorry, aber für echte SEAL Fans ist das hier nichts. Wir hoffen auf bessere Zeiten."
4,"Mit zwei Jahren Verzögerung bekommt Ami Winehouse den verdienten Medienhype, der ihr schon mit dem Erstling ""Frank"" zugestanden hätte.  Seit Lauryn Hill ist niemand mehr so selbstbewusst durch die Musikstile gewandert. Mühelos verbindet sie Sechtziger-Soul und Jazz mit moderner Hip-Hop-Attitüde. Doch vermutlich würde keiner über die Musik sprechen, wenn die sensationelle Stimme nicht wäre. Mit einem schwarzen Timbre, das man aus Tausenden herauserkennen würde, mit lässiger Phrasierung und der richtigen Portion Verbrauchtheit verleiht sie den Songs Tiefe, ohne das in den Staaten übliche ""Oversinging"". Man höre ""You Sent Me Flying"", das nach über zwei Minuten einen ultralässigen Beat reinfährt, oder wie der lässige ""October Song"" sich im Refrain kongenial ""Lullaby Of Birdland"" einverleibt. Doch auch bei den Balladen überzeugt sie. ""There Is No Greater Love"" schafft mit Flöten und Grillenzirpen eine Intimität, die an Stevie Wonder erinnert, und ""Take The Box"" verführt mit seiner seeligen Orgel und dem elegantem Refrain. Hier zeigt sie, wie man langsame Songs ohne Schmalz und Pathos präsentiert. Das dabei noch nicht jeder Song auf den Punkt genau gegart ist, z.B das etwas zu schlichte ""Fuck Me Pumps"", sei beim Erstling verziehen - alleine der Wagemut, aus radiotauglichen Schemata auszubrechen, verdient Respekt. Unterstützt wird die Musik von der rohen Produktion, die dem Album die Frische eines Livealbums gibt.  Wieder einmal verfestigt sich der Eindruck, als kämen die meisten innovativen Impulse derzeit aus England, wärend die USA in einer Endlosschleife aus Teenie-Punkrock und R&amp;B-konserven festhängt.  Das nach diesem Debüt der Nachfolger ""Back To Black"" das hohe Niveau nicht ganz hält sei ihr verziehen. Dann durchschlägt sie eben mit dem nächsten Album die Decke ..."
4,"Endlich gibt es die alten Folgen auch auf cd und die sind echt super. Mein einziger Kritikpunkt ist, daß die alte musik nicht übernommen wurde. Ansonsten kann man dieses Produkt nur empfehlen, allein schon wegen des Preisvorteils, da es ja eine dreier cd-Box ist. Die Geschichten sind klasse, besonders die der cd Nr1 -Die jagd nach den Millionendieben-."
1,"Leider musste ich nach dieser Ansage verstellen, dass Aggro nicht mehr Label Nr.1 in Deutschland ist.  Meiner Meinung nach ist fast keiner der Tracks gelungen, vor allem Tony D und KittKat bekommen ein dickes Minus für ihre Parts. Beide sind austauschbar und unterhalten höchstens im Intro.  Auch Sido und B-Tight machen mir zu sehr auf Kommerz. Mit dem Unterschied, dass sich Bobby nicht weiterentwickelt hat und für mich irgendwie nur noch ne Witzfigur dastellt :(... Die einzigen Rapper, die überzeugen sind Fler und Godsilla. Leider ist auch der Track von Frauenarzt höchstens Mittelmaß.  Und das sage ich nicht als Hater, sondern als jemand, der sämtliche Ansagen und alle Solo-Releases von Aggro(bis auf TonyD) bei sich im Schrank stehen hat. Schade Aggro, dass ihr euch in nur 2 Jahren von Selfmade Records überholen lasst... Raptechnisch kann es kein Aggro-Artist mit Fave, Kollegah und Co aufnehmen. Das ist Bombenrap und das ist die Zukunft. Ich hoffe Aggro merkt das auch und setzt auf Talente wie Godsilla und nicht auf TonyD oder KittyKat"
5,"Dylan ist zu alter (Best-)form zurück gekehrt. Was mit dem letzten Album schon angedeutet wurde findet in Modern Times nun seine Vollendung. Dylan besinnt sich auf seine Wurzeln und gleichzeitig auf die Wurzel aller Populärmusik:BLUES. Der Blues ist allgegenwärtig und Dylan und Bnad spielen ihn relaxt und mit mit dem nötigen Feeling. Dylan krächzt Textzeilen von tiefer Bedeutung(die Lyrics sind wunderbar gelungen) über die relaxten Shuffle-Rythmen und würzt hie und da mit einer deftigen Prise Country und Folk sowie schnellem Rock N Roll. Eine unfassbar geniale Coverversion des Muddy Waters-Klassikers ""Rollin And Tumblin"" ist auch dabei und als ob das ganze nicht genug wäre schmeisst Dylan noch ein paar Ballden/balladeske Songs hinterher die sowas von düster-schön sind, dass man nur zu dem Schluss kommen kann, dass Bob das geschafft hat, was fast niemand seiner Kollegen zu Stande bringt: Jahre nach den alten Hitscheiben und Klassikern ein Album zu machen, dass sich nicht vor Legenden wie ""Blonde On Blonde"" verstecken braucht.-----und damit ist eigentlich genug gesagt worden."
4,"Die CD ist leider nicht die Gesamtausgabe des Musicals, dennoch kann man sich gut in den Theatersaal versetzen.Nach meinem 3. Besuch in der neuen Flora bin ich von der CD Besetzung am meisten beindruckt. Leider ist nun in wenigen Tagen schluß mit dem Phantom in der Neuen Flora. Bleibt mir nur noch zu wünschen übrig,dass einmal eine Videoaufnahme dieses wirklich gelungenen Musicals aus der Neuen Flora auf den Markt kommt.Dieses müsste ja jetzt zu machen sein......."
1,Ein Werk wie dieses hätte ich von Mittermeier nicht erwartet. Die beiden Vorgängerscheiben Zapped und Back to life waren richtig gut gewesen.
2,"Ich kenne viele Soundtracks von John Williams, aber keinen derart schwachen. Schon sein ""Star Wars Episode III"" Soundtrack war enttäuschend, nur wenige der neuen Kompostitionen waren gelungen, bekannte Melodien wurden lieblos eingefügt. Mit dem ""Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of The Crystal Skull"" Soundtrack hat sich Williams selbst deutlich unterboten, meiner Meinung nach der schlechteste Score, den er bis jetzt komponiert hat. Jeder Indiana Jones Soundtrack hatte mitreißende Melodien zu bieten, nur der vierte nicht. Die neuen Melodien sind langweilig, uninspiriert und ideenlos wie vom Fließband. Nichts davon fällt einem besonders auf, der einzige kleine Wiedererkennungswert entsteht, weil man zu oft das Gefühl hat, vieles schon tausend Mal gehört zu haben. Das bekannte Indiana Jones Thema (""Raiders March"") wird viel zu selten zitiert, die anderen bekannten Melodien aus den Vorgängerfilmen wurden wie schon beim dritten Star Wars Soundtrack so herzlos integriert, als wären sie per Copy &amp; Paste in den Score eingefügt worden. Die ersten drei Indiana Jones Soundtracks sind brilliant, der vierte ist unglaublich schwach. Ein Stern wäre absolut gerechtferigt, den zweiten gebe ich nur dazu, weil das altbekannte Material zwar schlecht in den Soundtrack eingefügt wurde, aber im Gegensatz zum Rest wenigstens gut ist."
5,"Was Jason wade mit seiner Band hier abgeliefert hat kam vor allem überraschend. Da man heute sehr selten auf gute handgemachte Musik stößt kann man nur gespannt sein, was die Jungs in der Zukunft zustande bringen. Mit ihren Texten und Melodien erinnert man sich ein wenig an Pearl Jam, wobei Lifehouse sicherlich eigenständig ist. Man vermisst keine langen Gitarrensoli, wie z.B. von McCready, denn die Musik hat ihre eigene Stimmung. Aber ich würde die Platte nicht jedem empfehlen, da sie wohl nicht Jedermanns Sache ist. Wer momentan auf Nu-Metal Bands, wie Linkin Park abfährt, der wird sich zu Tode langweilen. Deshalb hört euch die Platte erst mal an und dann werdet ihr schon merken, ob es was für euch ist!"
5,"Habe mir heute die CD gekauft und bin restlos begeistert; sehr ruhiges Album (wahrscheinlich zu ruhig für das alte Plattenlabel von Del Amitri; man muss sich das mal vorstellen, dass die Plattenfirma den Vertrag mit Del Amitri gekündigt hat !),  sehr atmosphärisch , sehr bewegend , ""What is love for"" ist der  perfekte Soundtrack für die kalten Wintermonate, hoffentlich  kommt er bald auf Tour nach Deutschland (dann bitte auch mit  alten Del Amitri Songs !!   -- absolute Kaufempfehlung --"
5,"Also, ich hab den Soundtrack, seit ich Garden State im Kino gesehen hab, weil der Soundtrack sowie der Film einfach nur toll ist. Ich würde diesen Artikel echt jedem empfehlen, der etwas geschmack hat."
5,"Der geniale Songwriter Jeff Mangum ist wahrscheinlich genauso bekannt wie seine Band ""Neutral Milk Hotel"", nämlich so gut wie gar nicht. Und das ist sehr schade: denn nach dem tollen und eher experimentellen Debut-Album ""On Avery Island"" mit seinen Song-Brillanten ""Song Against Sex"", ""A Baby For Pree"" oder ""Gardenhead"" avancierten sie bereits zum Geheimtipp; doch dann erscheint ein Album mit nahezu ausschließlich Akustik-Stücken! Und danach? Gar nichts! So bleibt denn also ""In The Aeroplane Over The Sea"" ihr Meisterwerk... und was für eins! Mit seinen leicht verspielten Lyrics und teils kryptischen, wunderschönen Metaphern erzählt uns das Genie Mangum von Anne Frank und den Schrecken des Dritten Reiches. Eine unglaubliche, Gänsehaut erregende Authenzität wird dem Hörer hier geboten, mit einer kraftvollen, ehrlichen Stimme. Aber wer meint, hier Songs voller Trauer zu hören, der wird (bis auf das grandiose, 8-minütige ""Oh Comely"") enttäuscht sein, denn Mangum kann auch anders: ""Holland, 1945"" (die einzige Single; unbedingt die B-Seite ""Engine"" anhören!) rockt trotz der sensiblen Lyrics richtig, geanu wie ""King of Carrot Flowers, pts. 2&amp;3"". Einziger Mangel: zieht man die 2 Interludes ab, kommt man auf nur neun Songs. Aber die haben es in sich; an Intensität gibt es wenig vergleichbares. Entlassen werden wir mit dem zweiten Teil des wunderbaren ""Two Headed Boy"" mit den Zeilen: ""and when we break / we'll wait for our miracle / god is a place you will wait for the rest of your life"". Wunderbar melancholisch! Eines der besten Konzept-Alben, die ich je gehört habe! 5 Sterne sind da noch nicht genug..."
4,"Diese Green Day CD ist die bis dato erwachsenste die GD bisher veröffentlich hat.Die CD ist echt super,bis auf 2 Schwächen:Wer frühere,Punkigere,Green Day Songs mochte,wird entteucht-Die Lieder sind ruhiger und langsamer als früher.Die 2 Schwäche ist nicht Schlim-Mir hat ein echter Kracher gefehlt wie Basket Case bei Dookie oder Se.Jimmy auf dem Album American Idiot.Trodtzdem,absolut zu empfehlen!"
1,"Es wäre schön, wenn bei dem Artikel erwähnt wäre, dass es sich um Liveaufnahmen handelt. Ich wollte eigentlich die Original-Studioaufnahmen haben. Insofern ist die CD eine volle Enttäuschung. Schade. Aber wer eine gute Live-Zusammenstellung sucht, kommt sicher zu einer anderen (besseren) Bewertung."
1,CD enthält kein einziges Lied aus dem Film!!! Große Enttäuschung unter dem Weihnachtsbaum! Nicht mal mehr zurückgeben kann man das schon geöffnete Ding.
1,"Ich habe diese CD damals auch gekauft, weil meine Kleine die Lieder ständig nachgesungen hat und gern auf CD haben wollte. Als wir dieses Album dann sahen, haben wir uns so gefreut, doch dann auch bei uns die bittere Entäuschung. Schade, daß man so etwas überhaupt auf dem Markt bringt. Dabei gibt es ja die Originalmusik."
5,"Fünf Sterne für ein wunderbares Album.  Barbra Streisand mit ihrer klassischen Stimme und die poppigen Songs von Barry Gibb ergeben eine wunderbar harmonische, entspannte und zum Teil auch aufregende Platte im Stil des Klassikers ""Guilty"" von vor 25 Jahren - ihrem meistverkauftem Album überhaupt. Ich möchte sogar wagen zu behaupten, daß ""Guilty Pleasures"" um einiges besser ist als der Vorgänger. Einige Songs haben extremes Hitpotential - wären wir noch in einer Zeit wie vor 15, 20 Jahren, würde das Album mindestens zwei Nummer-Eins-Hits liefern: ""Stranger in a strange land"", eine kraftvolle Ballade mit Gänsehautrefrain und einem unter die Haut gehenden Text. ""Night of my life"", eine Uptempo-Nummer, der das Zeug zum Club-Klassiker hat und in den US-Billboard-Dancecharts in diversen Remixen bereits vordere Plätze belegt. Barbra singt mit unglaublicher Leidenschaft und Gefühl, die Songs sind mitreissend arrangiert, tolle Texte (""It's up to you"" + ""All the children"", bei dem sie nochmals aufs Tempo drückt), ein rundum gelungenges Werk, welches auf direktem Weg das Herz erreicht und gerade in Zeiten von Klingelton-Hits und anderen Grausligkeiten die guten alten Werte von Musik hochhält: Erstklassige und trotzdem eingängige Songs, gesungen von einer Jahrhundertstimme."
2,"Hab die Rezesionen gelesen und war richtig neugierig auf diese CD. Und ich hab sie mir wirklich oft angehört - doch diese Stimme geht nicht unter die Haut sondern eher auf den Nerv. Klingt als würde eine unbegabte Operndiva ihre Stimmübungen machen. 2 Sterne für die wunderschöne ""leise"" Musik, hauptsächlich Klavier und Gitarre und die eigentlich schönen Melodien. Aber diese Stimme...nein danke."
2,"Wow, welche Künstler da alle drauf zu finden sind!!! Naja, zumindest dachte ich mir das bevor ich die CD gehört hatte... Gabrielle, Sheryl Crow, Shelby Lynne, Robbie Williams &amp; ua Geri Halliwell geben sich auf diesem Soundtrack ein Stell-dich-ein, nur leider sind ihre Lieder verdammt schwach. Am besten schneidet noch Gabrielle ab, deren ""Out of reach"" ist ein unaufdringlicher melodischer Pop-Song, den mal gleich wieder vergessen hat, wenn man ihn gehört hat. Aber das ist im Vergleich zum Rest noch gut. Am meisten enttäuscht hat mich die musikalische Vorstellung von Robbie Williams, seine beiden Werke klingen wirklich überhaupt nicht nach Robbie-normal-Musik sondern nach Robbie-hat-eine-Frank-*würg*-Sinatra-CD-gehört-Musik. Kann sein das das manchem gefällt, mir absolut nicht. Was ich von Geri Halliwells Remake von ""It's raining men"" halten soll, weiß ich noch nicht. Wenn ich davon ausgehe das es von ihr ist ist es gar nicht mal sooooo schlecht. Aber auch nur dann...."
1,"Ich ärgere mich, daß ich nicht alle Rezensionen gelesen habe. Meistens lese ich nämlich die besten und die schlechtesten. Das Syntheziser- Geduddel als Hintergrundmusik ist lieblos, einfallslos und bei allen Liedern gleich! Und warum müssen gute alte Volksweisen mit einer Neutextierung und Neubearbeitung derart verunstaltet werden? Sie sind gut so, wie sie sind. Die eigenen Lieder von Mark Bender und Co. sind null acht fünfzehn, also nicht besonders. Jetzt da ich diese Rezension geschrieben und meinen Ärger Luft gemacht habe, landet diese CD in den Müll!!!"
4,"Hab mir die CD extra wegen einem kurzen Urlaub nach Italien geholt. Für den Sommer brauchts ja auch ein Gute-Laune-Album, dass fröhlich macht. Da kann ich dieses Album nur empfehlen. Neben den beiden bereits bekannten und recht peppigen Singles sind noch ein paar andere Sommersongs an Board. Gespickt mit eingängigen Melodien und noch einfachereren Texten. Allerdings gibts noch ein paar Lieder, die recht 0815 sind. Beim Gesang haperts auch manchmal. Doch Schwamm drüber. Ein nettes Album, dass man im Sommer immer wieder rauskramen und durchhören kann. Auch bei schlechtem Wetter."
2,"Als großer Fan früherer Werke aus der Feder von Michael Kunze (Elisabeth, Tanz der Vampire, Rebecca) habe ich der Veröffentlichung dieser CD lange entgegengefiebert. Nun liegt die CD im Player, und der Inhalt ist - gemessen an den (meiner Meinung nach zu Recht) hohen Erwartungen - eine Enttäuschung. Obwohl hier eine großartige Cast hörbar ihr Bestes gibt (allen voran Sabrina Weckerlin und ein gesanglich gereifter Patrick Stanke - mein besonderer Favorit ist allerdings Tim Reichwein als Louis XVI.), läßt das Gesamtergebnis Kraft und Einfallsreichtum vermissen.  Selbst jene Melodien, denen man Hit-Potential zuschreiben möchte (Illusionen, Weil ich besser bin), verkommen durch die seichte Instrumentierung nahezu zur Schlager-Ware. So kann auch die hohe Produktions-Qualität die CD nicht zum Hörerlebnis aufwerten. Zwei Sterne gibt's dennoch für die wunderbare Cast, deren Potential durch die enthaltenen Melodien von Sylvester Levay meiner Meinung nach längst nicht ausgeschöpft ist, sowie für den Weckerlin-Ohrwurm ""Blind vom Licht""."
4,"Also das Musical ist echt fantastisch die Lieder reißen einen wirklich mit im Stück nur leider gibt die CD nur einen kleinen Einblick in das Musical. Mit mageren 13 Tracks auf der CD, die zwar gut ausgewählt wurden, enttäuscht die CD Marie Antoinette leider.  Daher nur 4 sterne für die CD. Marie Antoinette bietet fantastische Stimmen wie Roberta Valentini, Ethan Freeman, Sabrina Weckerlin usw.. Guckt euch das Musical an es muss jeder selber entscheiden ob man das Geld in die CD investiert oder ob man mit einem Atemberaubenden Erlebnis wieder nach Hause fährt....Ich habe sie gekauft und bin zwar etwas enttäuscht jedoch bleiben diese Lieder einem im Ohr und ich hoffe das es wie bei Rebecca eine Gesamtaufnahme geben wird mit diesem unglaublichen Cast"
1,"Ich habe mir beide CDs jetzt schon einige Male komplett angehört. Es hilft aber alles nichts, bis auf 5, max. 6 Titel ist der Rest äußerst schwach und bedarf überhaupt nicht der Erwähnung! Diese Doppel-CD ist also nur für Sammler interessant, die alle Ausgaben haben müssen. Ansonsten: Finger weg! Jedes weitere Wort zu den BRAVO-HITS 59 ist zuviel."
1,"Da war ich ganz aufgeregt, bin schnell in den Laden gehuscht, um mir die gewohnte Klasse der Bravo Hits zu holen (sammle schon seit der ersten). Aber was ist das?!? 5 oder 6 Lieder OK, dann HipHop zum durchdrehen, Rock von der nicht sooooo angenehmen Sorte ... Ich glaube ich werde zu alt dafür ... falle wohl aus der Zielgruppe heraus. Nächstes Mal werde ich wohl doch wieder ins Musikgeschäft gehen und vorher reinhören müssen, anstatt sie einfach vertrauenswürdig in den Einkaufswagen zu legen ... schade eigentlich ..."
2,"Man was war das für ein Schock: ODB-Tod durch Überdosis, dafür sollte dann Anfang des Jahres mit dem Album den Fans das Trauern erleichtert werden. Ich für meinen Teil wurde mit der CD noch eher runter gezogen, da sie für mich kein würdiges Posthum-Album darstellt und zwar: die Songs stammen aus der 2003er-Phase,direkt nach der Entlassung, und man wird das Gefühl nicht los,das z.T., wie schon auf dem Vorgängeralbum , einzelne Melodien mit Texten willkürl. zusammengeschnitten wurden. Des-weiteren klingen ODBs Vocals etw. verkümmert, soll heißen irgendwie fehlt die Leidenschaft (oder sie ist Opfer der Technik geworden).Die Gästeliste liest sich famos, bleibt aber hinter den Erwartungen weit zurück (bestes Beispiel ist der Premo-Song, der nicht recht zünden will)! Einzig der Auftritt mit Cappadonna ist Hitlastig. Tja alles in allem ernüchternd und man muß sagen mehr Wu-Tang-Beteilig. (auch im Produktionsbereich) hätten der CD gut getan-so muß man wohl auf Besseres, sprich ""A son unique"", hoffen &amp; warten... R.I.P. ODB"
1,"Man hört bei der CD sofort, dass der Clan verzweifelt versucht, den alten Style wiederzuerwecken...die Beats sollen wohl wie die auf dem Enter..Album klingen, tun dies jedoch genausowenig , wie sie zu den Lyrics passen...scheclte abstimmung... holt euch Enter the 36 Chambers, meinetwegen auch Forever und W aber Ironflag is einfach geldverschwendung... zieht euch OutKast - Aquemini oder ATCQ rein..."
5,"Method Mans Debut ist ein mehr als gelungenes Hip-Hop Album. Die Tracks, von The RZA produziert, basieren auf simplen, düsteren und harten Beats im Stile von 36 Chambers oder Return to the 36 Chambers von Odb. Method Mans Flow und Skillz sind unantastbar, die Produktionen sind wie maßgeschneidert. Es gibt zwar keine echten Höhepunkte (""Bring the Pain"" am ehesten) und das Album ist relativ kurz, dafür ist es durchgehend gut und flüssig. Mein Favourite-Track ist definitiv ""Mr. Sandman"" feat. RZA, mit einem der sickesten Beats, RZAs Gravedigga-Flow und Meths unglaublichen Sprachfluss der teilweise schon wirkt, als hätte er das ganze im DElirium geschrieben (wer weiss..) Resumé: Wer den alten Hardcore-Wu-Tang-Style schätzt und etwas für Meth übrig hat, muss dieses Album haben! Peace"
2,"mit dem neuen G-Unit Sound ist das Legendäre Rap Duo Mobb Deep für immer gestorben. das Album sollte für die Masse bestimmt sein und floppte (wie auch anders?), Mobb Deep klingen eben nicht wie Young Buck und Co. Man wird ihnen ihre ""Realness"" nie wieder glauben können. Wer Mobb Deep hören will soll sich unbedingt Infamous holen, mehr kann ich dazu leider nicht sagen."
5,"Also dieses album ist mit abstand das Beste überhaupt.Aber wer Pi kennt und schätzt, kauft sich jedes.Alle genial. Kaufffffffffffft es euch"
1,"Irgendwie ist es bei Rammstein mittlerweile ein Phänomen im negativen Sinne - ""Reise, Reise"" war nach ""Herzeleid"", ""Sehnsucht"" und ""Mutter"" das erste Album der Band das mich ziemlich enttäuscht hatte wo ich dachte dass es beim nächsten Album nur besser werden kann allerdings war bei ""Rosenrot"" das Gegenteil der Fall. Es war schon ungewöhnlich dass ""Rosenrot"" für Rammstein Verhältnisse relativ kurz nach den letzten Album veröffentlicht wurde, letztendlich wirkte das ganze auf mich dann auch wie eine Ansammlung von ""Reise Reise"" B-Seiten - erschreckend dass man so ein schlechtes Album im negativen Sinne noch toppen konnte. Tja nun liegen 4 Jahre zwischen ""Rosenrot"" und den neuen Album ""Liebe ist für alle da"" und durch vereinzelte Meldung dass diese Album sich wieder mehr an ""Herzeleid"" orientieren soll durfte man endlich wieder auf eine Steigerung hoffen.  Die Hoffnung wird allerdings im Keim erstickt, von wegen Back to the Roots, keine Ahnung wer solche Meldungen in die Welt gesetzt hat diese Leute haben anscheinend Tomaten auf den Ohren, Rammstein zeigen einmal mehr dass es noch schlechter gehen kann... Gut ""Rammlied"" ist ein Versuch eine Bandhymne alâ ""Rammstein"" von ""Herzeleid"" Album zu fabrizieren allerdings auch nur ein Versuch. Zu belanglos plätschert der Song mit dominanten, billigen Keyboardsounds (von den Gitarren ist recht wenig zu hören) vor sich hin, das ganze mit eher peinlichen Reimen wie: ""bist du einsam und allein, wir sind zurück, schalte ein"". Von wegen ""nun das warten hat ein Ende, leiht Euer Ohr einer Legende"", von einer Legende sind Rammstein mit diesen belanglosen Album meilenweit entfernt..... ""Ich tu Dir weh"" wirkt nur vom Sado/Maso angelehnten Text her hart - ""der Körper schon total entstellt, egal, erlaubt ist was gefällt - ich tu dir weh"", musikalisch ist der Song allerdings recht harmlos, wieder ist das Keyboard zu dominant und macht aus den Song eine harmlose Radionummer im Midtempo Stil.  Weiter gehts mit ""Waidmanns Heil"" wo zum ersten mal das Tempo etwas flotter ist. Inhaltlich eine Art Jagdsong - ""auf den Lande auf, den Meer lauert das Verderben, die Kreatur muss sterben"" - wo allerdings nicht wirklich klar ist wer wem jagt. Auch wenn der Song flotter ist kann er mich ebenfalls nicht wirklich überzeugen, von wirklich harten Nummern wie ""Asche zu Asche"" ist der Song meilenweit entfernt, mit seltsamen Breaks zwischen Strophen und Refrain wirkt ""Waidmanns Heil"" noch dazu irgendwie unzugänglich.  Bei ""Haifisch"" weiß ich ehrlich gesagt nicht ob ich lachen oder weinen soll, die ersten 3 Songs waren schon schwach aber dies ist der bisherige absolute Tiefpunkt. Textlich ein wenig an Mackie Messer - ""und der Haifisch, der hat Zähne"" - angelehnt ist das vielleicht noch eine nette Idee, musikalisch ist das für mich allerdings eine schlechte Depeche Mode Kopie. Nichts gegen Depeche Mode, ich mag sie sogar sehr, aber das Rammstein hier auf billigen Synthiepop machen wirkt einfach nur lächerlich.  ""B********"" ist dann der erste und einzige richtig gute Song der düster und im Refrain endlich mal mit dominanteren Gitarren daher kommt. Eine Art Playdoyer für das Verbotene - ""tu das nicht, lass das sein, fass das nicht an, sag einfach nein"" lebt der Song von den fast schon Grunzgesangartigen (steht Till gut zu Gesicht) Refrain ""Bückstabü hol ich mir, Bückstabü hol ich mir"".  Ich hätte mir mehr Songs in dieser Art gewünscht stattdessen wird es mit ""Frühling in Paris"" extrem peinlich und kitschig -&gt; ""wenn ich ihre Haut verließ, der Frühling blutet in Paris"". Balladen schön und gut aber die einzige richtige gute Rammsteinballade war ""Seemann"" was hier mit ""Frühling in Paris"" wiederum präsentiert wird ist langweilig und uninspiriert, ganz schlimm wird es wenn Till auch noch kurz französisch singt.  ""Wiener Blut"" wird wahrscheinlich aufgrund des Textes für Diskussionen sorgen und zwar thematisieren Rammstein hier der ""Josef Fritz Inzestfall"". Irgendwie wundert es nicht dass Rammstein sich damit in einen ihrer Songs auseinandersetzen, bietet das doch genügend Grundstoff für ein fast schon typisches Rammsteinlied. Das ganze ist textlich aus der Ich-Perspektive von Josef Fritzl geschrieben - ""komm mit mir, komm auf mein Schloss da wartet Spaß im Tiefgeschoß""; ""nein man wird uns nicht entdecken, wir lassen uns das Leben schmecken, und bist Du manchmal auch allein, ich pflanze Dir ein Schwesterlein"" - musikalisch ist das ganze aber recht langweilig umgesetzt, die Strophen werden nur von Keyboardsounds unterlegt während lediglich im Refrain ""seid ihr bereit, willkommen in der Dunkelheit"" und am Ende des Songs die Gitarren zur Geltung kommen. Da hätte man mehr draus machen können wie gesagt textlich typisch Rammstein wo ein brisantes Thema umgesetzt wird ohne wirklich Stellung zu beziehen, musikalisch allerdings leider recht belanglos....  Was soll man zu ""Pussy"" noch großartig sagen? Peinlicher Text - ""you've got a pussy, I have a dick, so whats the problem, let's do it quick"" - ein ebensolcher Videoclip von dem sich angeblich sogar die eigene Plattenfirma distanziert (wundert mich nicht, ich finde diesen einfach nur niveaulos....) reichen anscheinend aus um zu provozieren und so für Diskussionen zu sorgen dabei ist das ganze musikalisch nicht der Rede wert, wieder mal ist das ganze mit billigen und zu dominanten Keyboardsounds unterlegt somit wirkt das nicht wirklich hart sondern langweilig (irgendwie lässt ""Amerika"" grüßen und der Song war schon schlecht...)  Der Titelsong ""Liebe ist für alle da"" erinnert ein wenig an ""Asche zu Asche"", statt: ""warmer Körper, heißes Kreuz, falsches Urteil, kaltes Grab"" ertönt nun: ""warmes Wasser, schöne Laiber (?), wie sie glänzen, in der Sonne, ich schleich mich an"" im gleichen Takt. Das ist nicht gerade innovativ, immerhin entsteht so der einzige richtige Bezug zu ""Herzeleid"" allerdings ist ""Liebe ist für alle da"" als ganzes gesehen zu abstrakt und unzugänglich um wirklich überzeugen zu können, hier wird teilweise nur sinnlos auf den Instrumenten herumgedroschen was auch nicht gerade einen guten Song ausmacht...  In ""Mehr"" dominieren einmal mehr die Keyboards, die Strophen sind sehr ruhig während im Refrain kurz mal die Gitarren zur Geltung kommen. Textlich wirkt das wie ein Abgesang auf den Konsumwahn - ""ich brauche vieles und viel davon und nur für mich, von allen was man haben will, brauche ich 10 mal so viel""; ""ich werde nie satt, ich werde nie satt, es ist besser wenn man mehr hat"" - wo ich mir einen spannenderen Songaufbau gewünscht hätte; ähnlich wie bei ""Wiener Blut"" wäre hier im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes ""mehr"" drinnen gewesen...  Mit ""Roter Sand"" wird das Album mit einer Art Westernballade abgeschlossen - ""eine Liebe, 2 Pistolen, eine zielt mir ins Gesicht""; ""Roter Sand und zwei Patronen, eine stirbt im Pulverkuss"" wo ich nicht so recht weiß was ich davon halten soll. Mit Pfeifpassagen erinnert das ganze entfernt an die Musik von Ennio Morricone (""Zwei glorreiche Halunken"", ""Für eine handvoll Dollar"") oder auch an die Anfangsmelodie des Bud Spencer / Terence Hill Westerns ""Die rechte und die Linke Hand des Teufels"", allerdings wird die Klasse von solchen Westernsoundtracks nicht wirklich erreicht. Ich habs ja zuvor schon mal gesagt die einzig richtig gute Ballade war ""Seemann"" und mit Abstrichen vielleicht noch ""Klavier"" (ist halt mehr oder weniger ein musikalischer ""Seemann"" Klon) und während der erste Balladenversuch des Albums ""Frühling in Paris"" einfach nur kitschig und lächerlich klingt, ist ""Roter Sand"" eigentlich nur eines nämlich langweilig. Pfeifpassagen, Akustikgitarren und Keyboards im Hintergrund ziehen den Song ziemlich in die Länge, dabei besitzt der Song gerade mal eine Länge von knapp 4 Minuten.  Tja was soll ich zu den Album noch großartig sagen? Was bleibt ist ein einziger guter Song und zwar ""B********"", den Rest kann man getrost vergessen, schon erschreckend wie Rammstein zeigen dass es immer noch schlechter gehen kann. Da halte ich ehrlich gesagt sogar noch das letzte Oomph! Album ""Monster"" für spannender und selbst dies ist nicht gerade ein richtiges Highlight von Oomph! (kann man ja in meiner entsprechenden Rezension nachlesen was ich zu diesen Album geschrieben habe)...."
5,"Dieses Album ist zwar noch nicht auf dem Markt, aber ich habe gestern das Vorstellungskonzert des Albums in Amsterdam gesehen. Ein sehr gelungenes Werk. Ein muss für jeden Epica-Fan."
2,"KanYe West versteht es tatsächlich, solide Beats zu basteln und den ein oder anderen Ohrwurm zu produzieren. Vielleicht sollte man ihm sogar dafür dankbar sein, dass er den amerikanischen (und internationalen) Charts zu einem besseren Qualitätsdurchschnitt verhilft. Aber wen interessieren die Charts überhaupt? Ist es mit Hip Hop wirklich schon so weit gekommen, dass man als Messias gefeiert wird, sobald man als erwachsener Mann mit Vorbildfunktion realisiert, dass die Diamanten, die man trägt, unter menschenrechtsverletzenden Bedingungen be-/verarbeitet werden (""Diamonds from Sierra Leone"")? Oder weil man nur selten das Wort ""Bitch"" benutzt, zumal dies fragwürdig ist, da KanYes Frauenbild in Interviews und teilweise sogar in seinen Texten eigentlich nicht so charmant ausfällt (nach dem herzerweichenden Lied für seine Mutti, ""Hey mama"", kommt ""Celebration"", Textauszug: ""you know what this is; it's a celebration bitches; grab a drink, grab a glass; after that I grab your ass"")? Ja, dieser Mann muss wahrhaft ein Genie sein. Wenigstens wird sogar in manchen 5-Sterne Rezensionen zugegeben, das Mr. West keinen guten Flow hat (was im Vergleich zu Kollegen wie MF Doom, Beans oder auch seinem feature in ""We Major"", Nas, ziemlich offensichtlich wird). Zusammen mit John Legend und Common (die Reinkarnation von Marvin Gaye, nicht wahr?) wird er in den Staaten als Retter des guten Geschmacks im Hip Hop angehimmelt und lebt dieses Image auch auf eine dermaßen ekelige Weise aus, dass es mich wundert, dass sich KanYe West in Europa so gut vermarkten lässt. Aber er hat ja auch was gegen Bush gesagt, was insbesondere in Deutschland gut ankommt (muss man intelligent sein, um zu wissen, dass der amerikanische Präsident ein Nerd ist?). Ich erwarte von einem MC entweder erzählerisches Talent (z.B. Mr Complex), einen eigenen, gut akzentuierten Flow (z.B. Busdriver), kreative Reime (z.B. Dizzee Rascal) oder Inhalte, die wirklich zum Denken anregen (z.B. Saul Williams). KanYe West weist in meinen Augen (bzw. Ohren) keines dieser Attribute auf und kriegt für ""Late Registration"" gerade noch 2 Sterne (für die teilweise gelungenen Beats). Mehr nicht."
1,"Stefanie Heinzmann ist sympathisch, sie kann singen und hat ihren eigenen Stil. Aus der ganzen Masse von Popstars sticht sie auf jeden Fall heraus. Der Beginn ihrer Karriere war schlichtweg blendend und vielversprechend. ""Masterplan"" war zwar kein reines Pop-Album, klang aber sehr abwechslungsreich und peppig für ein Debüt. Stefanie Heinzmann versuchte sich in mehreren Musikbereichen und überzeugte fast über das gesamte Album hindurch. ""My man is a mean man"" war ein großer Hit und ein absoluter Ohrwurm! So weit so gut, doch dann ging es bergab. ""Like a bullet"", die zweite Single, war zwar irgendwie radiotauglich, blieb aber nicht im Ohr. ""Masterplan"" hatte viel mehr zu bieten als diese laue Pop/Rock Nummer. ""Revolution"" als dritte Single zu nehmen war für mich ein schlechter Scherz. Ich mochte alle Songs auf ""Masterplan"", aber ""Like a bullet"" fand ich nur mittelprächtig und ""Revolution"" als einzigstes Lied schlecht - und der Song wurde zur Single gemacht und floppte wie die Vorgänger-Single. Was war nur los? Warum drehten die Produzenten Videos für laue Popsongs statt die Songs zu veröffentlichten von ""Masterplan"", die wirklich gut waren wie ""Only so much oil.."" oder ""Free love"". Wer dachte, es kann nicht mehr schlimmer kommen, der schaue sich dies an: ""Masterplan"" kommt jetzt nochmal auf den Markt. Enthalten ist u.a als Bonus die vierte Single ""The Unforgiven"", ein Song, der auf der Original-Version von ""Masterplan"" noch nicht drauf war. Es ist ein Cover von Metallica und wer hätte gedacht, das ein völlig neu aufgenommener Song noch schlechter werden würde als ""Revolution""? Wollen die Produzenten einen Rekord aufstellen? Welche Künstlerin veröffentlicht die meisten schlechten Songs? Das Problem ist schlichtweg, dass sie Talent hat und sehr gut singt. Manche Songs von ""Masterplan"" sind echte Perlen und die wurden einfach nicht genutzt. Das Bonusmaterial auf der neuen ""Masterplan"" Limited Edition ist ein schlechter Scherz. Neben ""The Unforgiven"" sind noch die 4 Videos zu den 4 Singles drauf und ein kurzes Video. Musikalisch hat sie einen Remix von ""Like a bullet"" draufgepackt (wer braucht sowas?) und die Songs ""I wrote the book"" &amp; ""Supersticion"", die beide auf der Maxi-CD von ""Like a bullet"" enthalten waren. Hat jeder Fan schon, braucht auch keiner, da beide Songs unglaublich schlecht sind. Ich bete für Stefanie, das ihr 2009 erscheinenes zweites Album wieder so gute Songs enthält wie ""Masterplan"" und man diesmal die Songs zu Singles macht, die Pepp und Ohrwurmeffekt besitzen. Bitte keine ""Like a bullet"", ""Revolution"" oder ""The Unforgiven"" Songs mehr, das ist alles Grütze.."
5,"Ich erinnere mich noch sehr gut an das Unplugged-Konzert, welches ich vor etwa anderhalb Jahren in Dresden genießen durfte. Die Songs in einer etwas ruhigeren Version zu hören war einfach unvergleichlich, Martas Stimme kam so noch viel besser zur Geltung und es machte einfach Spaß, zuzuhören. Dieses Konzertgefühl stellt sich sogar schon beim Anhören dieser CD ein. Man will tanzen, mitsingen, klatschen - alles, was man auf einem richtigen Konzert auch tun würde. Auf der knapp 74 Minuten langen CD findet man ein sehr schöne Auswahl von Die Happys Songs, darunter auch ein tschechisches Lied, das von ihrem Vater geschrieben worden ist. Besonders hervorzuheben sind ""Violent Dreams"", welches auch unplugged ein echter Knaller ist (mal von den leichten Textproblemen abgesehen ;)) und ""Not that kind of girl"", wo man permanent mitsingen will. Während und nach dem Genuss dieses Albums muss man einfach gute Laune haben! Wobei man nach den letzten Klängen beinahe ein Trauergefühl verspürt, dass das Konzert zu Ende ist. Volle fünf Sterne für diese gelungene gute-Laune-live-CD! Die Happy rocken selbst unplugged :)! Nur ist es schade, dass ""Supersonic Speed"" nicht mit auf dieser CD ist, sondern nur auf der Single-Edition von ""I am"" - denn das ist ein weiterer Höhepunkt dieses Konzertes. Wer Die Happy kennt und liebt, sollte sie sich auf jeden Fall nicht live entgehen lassen, ob nun unplugged oder nicht. Und das gilt auch für diejenigen, denen der Name Die Happy noch nicht so geläufig ist."
5,Ich bin seit Jahren begeistert von der Musik der Söhne Mannünsheims und diese Live Cd ist ein riesen Geschenk an uns Fans.Jedes Stück auf dieser Live Cd ist voller Gefühl egal ob es Power of the Sound ist oder Zurück zu Dir und auch die Titel der ersten Platte Zion spiegeln all das was wir in unserer Gesellschaft vermitteln sollten.Xavier Naidoo ist ein toller Künstler und zusammen mit den Söhnen Mannheims macht er einfach wunderbare Musik.Ich kann jedem diese Live Platte nur entfehlen auch Leuten sie noch nicht viel von den Söhnen gehört haben kauft sie und ihr hört gute und ehrliche Musik aus tiefsten Herzen.
5,"Nach langem Warten endlich da und im DVD Player..... und ich muss sagen ein MEISTERWERK!!!!! Bleibt zu hoffen das es kein goodbye für immer ist!!!! In Punkto Stimme, Ausstrahlung, Gefühle kann Michelle KEINE das Wasser reichen!!!!!!! Michelle WAR, IST und BLEIBT die Königin/Diva der deutschen Schlagers!!!!! WIR vergessen dich ganz SICHER nicht so schnell, Michelle, du bleibst auf MEISTERWERKEN gebrannt!!!!!!!"
5,"Pünktlich zum tollen Frühlingswetter gibt es nun die neue Rosenstolz - Single ""Blaue Flecken"", und zwar gleich in 3 verschiedenen Versionen. In schweren Zeiten für den eingefleischten Rosenstolz-Fan wird die dritte Single aus dem Nr.1-Album ""Die Suche geht weiter"" ausgekoppelt.  ""Blaue Flecken"" - Ein Song, der gute Laune macht, zum Frühling passt und einfach im Ohr bleibt. Bereits 2007 wurde der Song live während der Sommertour vorgestellt und kam beim Publikum bestens an, genau wie auch auf den Konzerten der ""Bist du dabei""-Tour. Kein Wunder also, das ausgerechnet ""Blaue Flecken"" nun ausgekoppelt wird. Als die Entscheidung fiel, gerade diesen Song auszukoppeln, war die Rosenstolz-Welt noch in Ordnung. Die Tour war in vollem Gange und tausende Fans feierten Rosenstolz auf ihren Konzerten. Doch dann kam Anfang 2009 der Schock - die letzten Konzerte der Wintertour wurden abgesagt, wenig später auch sämtliche Konzerte der Sommertour. Der Grund: Peter erkrankt am Burn-Out Syndrom. Eine schwere Zeit begann, nicht nur für Rosenstolz selbst, sondern auch für alle Fans.  Die neue Single gibt da auch neuen Mut - alle sind in Gedanken bei Peter und drücken die Daumen für eine gute Besserung.  Auch wenn der Text zu ""Blaue Flecken"" schon ein wenig trauriger ist, ist es ein Song, der mich zum lachen bringt. Der meine Laune verbessert, der mir einfach viel gibt. Viele kennen eine solche Situation - Man verlässt einen Menschen den man liebt, oder wird verlassen. Und trotz der Trennung bleiben blaue Flecken in Form von Gedanken oder Erinnerungen an die längst vergangene Zeit. Man hat abgeschlossen, kann und will aber nicht vergessen. Auf der einen Seite geht es einem besser, auf der anderen Seite fehlt etwas im Leben.  Wieder einmal ein Text, in den man sich hineinversetzen kann. Der gerade in der melanchonischen 3 Uhr morgens-Version auch mal bei Liebeskummer helfen kann. Es ist immer wieder faszinierend, wie es Rosenstolz gelingt, eigentliche gute-Laune-Songs in glasklare Balladen zu verpacken.  Ein weiteres Highligth ist natürlich auch die Live-Version, die einen Vorgeschmack auf die bald erscheinende Live-DVD gibt. Rosenstolz sind live erstklassig, und es ist immer wieder überwältigend, dass nahezu alle Besucher eines Konzertes jedes einzelne Lied mitsingen können. Und das nutzen die beiden natürlich auch gnadenlos aus, und lassen gerne mal das Publikum singen, was einfach Gänsehaut verursacht. Auch Peter ""durfte"" :) auf der neuen Single mal seine Gesangsleistung unter Beweis stellen, indem er erstmals in der Geschichte eine eigene B-Seite aufnahm. Entstanden ist ""Susi im roten Kleid"", hört sich ein wenig nach junger Boyband aus einem kleinen Garagenstudio an. Der Text erzählt eine lustige Geschichte über eine Person, die tatsächlich existiert und zu Peters Freunden zählt. Ein Song, der sicherlich nicht massenkompatibel ist und der zeigt, dass Rosenstolz immer wieder Neues ausprobiert und dass man sich auch traut Songs zu veröffentlichen, die sicherlich nicht dem ""Mainstream"" zuzuordnen sind.  Neben ""Susi"" findet man ein weiteres neues Lied auf der Single - ""Alles ist erleuchtet"". Früher dachte ich immer, B-Seiten sind Titel, die irgendwann mal aufgenommen wurden, aber einfach nicht gut genug für ein Album sind. Und bevor man sie irgendwo im Archiv verstauben lässt, werden sie mit auf eine Single gepresst. Vielleicht stimmt das so auch, aber B-Seiten von Rosenstolz haben einfach eine wahnsinnige Qualität. Ich habe ""Alles ist erleuchtet"" drei mal gehört bisher, und schon schwirrt mir der Song im Kopf.  Alles in allem eine typische Rosenstolz-Maxi die einfach überzeugt. Drücken wir die Daumen, das ""Blaue Flecken"" nicht die letzte Single von Rosenstolz ist. Dennoch ist es ganz klar, das Peters Gesundheit an erster Stelle steht und alleine er entscheidet, wann und ob er sich wieder in der Lage fühlt, zurück zu kommen."
1,Also ich bin echt von der Special Edition enttäuscht weil sich damit sowas von überhaupt keine mühe geben wurde. Das T-Shirt ist billig bedruckt so das mit in die waschmaschiene stecken nicht viel los ist. Vorallem finde ich die art wie das Tshirt bedruckt wurde auch etwas lieblos. Zudem die fahne auch nicht der brüller. Der SARG selbe ist schucklos -selbst ein schuhkarton ist schuckvoller- . Das einzige was man sagen kann ist das die CD einsame spitze ist. Jedoch muss man dafür dann nicht ca.100 euro bezahlen. Defizit: CD auf jeden fall kaufen jedoch die Special Box ohne das Special echt nicht wert gekauft zu werden. Deshalb von mir nur einen stern
2,"Sorry, aber ich finde die CD nicht gut.....  Ich finde die Bravo Hits CDs werden immer schlechter!!! Früher waren die CDs echt viel besser als heute!!!"
1,"...wie sich Mark Medlock verheizen lässt. Der Titel klingt wie eine Mischung aus 'Coco Jamboo' und 'Do The Limbo Dance' - und die sind beide grottenschlecht. Warum muss Mark Medlock immer noch am Rockzipfel von Bohlen hängen, der sich nicht mal mehr die Mühe macht, zumindest geringe Abweichungen in seine musikalischen Konzeptionen (nicht: Kompositionen) einzustreuen? Kann er nicht endlich etwas Eigenständiges machen? Die Stimme und das nötige Selbstvertrauen hat er doch.' Mamacita' klingt jedenfalls, als hätte man es schon tausendmal gehört - zuletzt 2008 in Form eines Titels namens 'Summer Love' - und deshalb nervt es. Nee, ein Sommerhit wird das nicht."
5,"Einen würdigen Schlussstrich unter ihre viel zu kurze Karriere setzt dieses Meisterwerk. Der unverkennbare Gitarrensound, wunderbare Melodien, die überwechselnd in wildem Stoner-Donner einen die Augen schließen lassen, um eine knappe Stunde später aus der Meditation zu erwachen, und aufs Neue den Play-Knopf zu drücken. Als Fan aller älteren Scheiben stellte sich das Vergnügen allerdings erst nach öfterem Anhören ein, denn diese CD ist anders, nicht so straightforward, abrupte Breaks und Rhytmuswechsel verunsichern den überzeugten Headbanger zunächst, aber schließlich sind es Lieder wie ""one inch man"", ""el rodeo"" oder das heiß geliebte ""spaceship landing"", die zeigen, wie zeitlos Kyuss Musik machen konnte."
2,"Heute kam es mit der Post. Hurra! Endlich ein neues Masters Album; lange erwartet; vor tausend Jahren bestellt !! Endlich halte ich es in den Händen! Die Freude war aber muss ich sagen kurz, als ich es in den CD Player steckte und dieser es auch schlucken musste. Nach dem katastrophalen,seichten Vorgängeralbum ( was anders, fast schon besser produziert ist) jetzt also ein Album, was eher wieder in die Richtung ""Deep in the hole"" knarrzt, einige Elemente von "" Western lodge""in sich birgt; aber die auch nur am Rande. Bedient hat sich Goss meines Erachtens sehr am neusten Queens- Album, was die Sounds betrifft. Ansonsten steckt ziemlich viel von dem was Goss sonst noch macht drin . Ein Song ist sogar mit den Jungs von UNKLE. Der fängt stark an, lässt aber vom Arrangement und Sound dann wieder stark nach. Diese, ich nenne es jetzt mal Dynamik- ist übrigens bei fast allen Songs so.Man denkt sich : ""Mensch geil ! Endlich ein geiler Stoner-Song... Ach so... das warŽs also... nur ein Stoner -Intro !"" Dann wieder netter, aber teils auch nervender 0/8/15 Rock, mit bluesie-Schemen, die relativ herkömmlich und altbacken sind. Nervend, da manche Passagen einfach zu einfach gestrickt sind , und mit immer der gleichen Gesangspassage ellenlang gezogen werden.Schlichtweg Einfallslos. Zwischendurch kann man dann aber doch mal aufathmen, da die gewohnte GossŽsche Deep in the hole- Produktionsweise zum tragen bzw. hören kommt. Warum denn dann nicht durchgängig fett??? Aber zwischendurch auch wieder die Frage: ""Was soll das??... irgendwelches unausgereiftes Synthie-gefrickel."" Dann haben wir auch noch nen DUB-Song mit Rock - Einflüsen. Aber halt auch keine Burner - Nummer; fliesst so dahin.Ich denke wennŽs um ""harten DUB"" geht - lieber DuB-Trio hören. Was hat denn DUB auf ner Masters-Scheibe zu suchen??  Vielleich neue FX-Geräte?? Muss man die denn unbedingt an den Start bringen, nur damit sich deren Kauf gelohnt hat? Man hat es richtig schwer, wenn man sich ein Album wie Deep in the hole gewünscht hat... Ich finde das Album relativ einfallslos, eher eben eine Collage, aus dem was Herr Goss sonst so treibt. Der zweite Hördurchgang hat es auch nicht mehr rausgerissen. Wenn beim ersten Höreindruck die lang ersehnte ""Masters-Gänsehaut"" wegbeleibt und man dann auch noch mitten in einem Track weiterdrückt, weil man dieser schon ab Mitte nicht mehr aushält, ist das kein schönes Hörvergnügen. Der Oberhammer kommt dann zum Schluss: Ein Stück, was einfach so dahergejammt ist, und als First-Take aufgenommen wurde. Keinerlei Masters-Nostalgie ! Einfach malŽn Stück aufnehmen und dies so verbraten, weil die Einfälle nicht mehr für was Konstruktives reichten.  Die CD ist nach dem Motto : ""Des passt scho! "" zusammengenudelt worden. Das Glocken-Cover passt meiner Meinung auch nicht zum Sound. Es ist viel zu pompös und düster, im Vergleich zum eher minimalistischen Sound gewählt. Ich bin total enttäuscht worden. Einmal, wegen des immer und immer wieder verschobenen Release Termins und zweitens wegen dieser unausgereiften Produktion, welche ein Jahr Vorfreude gekostet hat, und heute innerhalb von einer CD-Länge zunichte gemacht wurde. Die Zeiten von Meilensteinen wie Deep in the Hole und ""welcome to the western lodge"" sind vorbei!!! Wahrscheinlich ist es auch sehr schwierig, die Qualität und das damit verbundene Gefühl dieser Alben zu toppen. Sorry,- aber ich bin wirklich ganz schön enttäuscht !! Schade,sagt die Made ..."
2,"Welcome to the Club also, hm!? Ich hab mich beim anhören der beiden CDs ernsthaft gefragt, welcher Club das wirklich sein soll. Welches Publikum will man mit dieser CD begeistern? Mich hat die CD nicht begeistert, obwohl ich sehr gerne DJ Networx, Tunnel Trance Force etc, aber auch Trancemasters höre. Da wirkt die WTTC eher wie eine CD für einen Kindergeburtstag ohne Anspruch und Geschmack."
5,"Als ich diese CD in den Händen hielt hatte ich noch nicht so viel von Bob Marley gehört, doch war ich gleich begeistert. Seine größten und besten Hits sind auf CD 1, auf CD 2 findet man Remixes einiger Titel. Es ist echt für jeden was dabei, für Kenner, und auch für die die in diesen Musikstil reinhören wollen. Also: Kaufen! Es lohnt sich echt!!!"
2,"Da ich sowohl das Spiel SACRED sehr gern gespielt habe und auch Hörspiele liebe, hatte ich mich richtig auf das Hörspiel gefreut, zumal es im Bereich Fantasy nicht wirklich viele Mitbewerber gibt. Musik: Als Titelmusik Metal-Geschrammel mit Gesang zu verwenden finde ich absolut daneben. Ein neutraler Orchester-Score wäre wesentlich passender gewesen und hätte immens zur Stimmungsbildung beigetragen. Metal passt für mich absolut nicht zu Fantasy. Sprecher: Die Stimmen kommen dem Hörer allesamt bekannt vor. Dies allein macht aber noch lange kein gutes Hörspiel aus. So klingt der Erzähler an vielen Stellen komplett emotionslos und platt und die Sprecher erreichen oftmals nur Dorftheater-Niveau und man merkt, dass sie ihre Texte nur ablesen. Stimmung: Kam bei mir überhaupt nicht auf, weil zwar alle klassischen Stilmittel eines guten Hörspiels vorhanden waren, aber diese viel zu schlecht eingesetzt wurden und streckenweise auch nicht miteinander harmonieren. Wer die Wahl hat und die DRIZZT-Reihe noch nicht kennt, sollte eher da mal reinhören."
1,"So viel Einheitsbrei. Seine Stimme ist wahrlich nicht übel. Aber diese klebrige Masse Songs ist wie ein Kaugummi, den man ganz schnell wegwerfen möchte. Die Packung schlägt übel auf den Magen. Auch wenn er damit mochmals in die Charts steigen sollte, ist es ein trauriger Abgesang und der Untergang ins Niemandsland. Ausser Deutschland und Oesterreich ist niemand wirklich interessiert."
1,"es tut mir leid, aber ich kann mich keineswegs den Rezensionen der bisherigen (5 *) anschließen. Auf mich wirkt das Album wenig inspirativ, sondern insgesamt langweilig und wiederholend. Zum Teil scheint der Musik nur ein anderer Text auferlegt worden zu sein.  Und zum Live Auftritt beim Grand Prix habe ich auch eine andere Meinung. Mich erinnerte der Gesang doch sehr an den des Heroen Zlatko, der sich vor Jahren hier im Lande versuchte zu qualifizieren. Es ist wie so häufig in der Musik, ein Album, das sicher seine Anhänger hat oder finden wird, aber auch ein Album, das keineswegs den Weg in den Gehörgang findet.  Ich wünsche trotzdem denen, die ihren Spaß an dem Album haben, diesen beim Hören und habe mich nach intensivem Anhören entschlossen, dieses Album aus meinem Archiv zu verbannen."
1,"Ich habe mir diese CD angehört, aber es kommt ganz und gar nicht an die echte NDW ran, die lieder sind im Original 1000 mal besser, allein wenn ich schon die schlechte Version von Major Tom höre wird mir übel, also die NDW Hits sind zwar toll... aber nur die Originalen und nicht diese Version. Also meiner Meinung lohnt der Kauf nicht. Kauft euch lieber die Originale aus der NDW Zeit, da ist das Geld besser Investiert!"
5,"... und es wäre immer noch gut. Schön wenn es noch Künstler gibt, die immer ihrer Linie treu geblieben sind und auf die man sich immer verlassen kann. Live ist er eh unschlagbar und seine Lieder haben genau die Mischung zwischen Spaß und Tiefgang, die ein Spitzenalbum braucht. Sollte es noch jemanden geben, der MMW nicht kennt, kann sich hier den perfekten Überblick verschaffen. Unbedingte KAUFEMPFEHLUNG!!! Für alle anderen ist es wahrscheinlich die längste Praline der Welt und kann komplett mit Genuss verspeist werden. 5 Sterne für Westernhagen - 5 Sterne für die Voter, die dieses Album zusammengewählt haben!"
4,Elton John - Greatest Hits 1970-2002
5,"Eine schöne Zusammenfassung der größten Hits aus den letzten Alben zw. 1990 und 2000! Als echter Fan besitzt man natürlich jedes Album, jedoch mein Freund findet dies als ""frischer U2-Fan"" richtig gut. Also volle Punktzahl für U2!!!"
5,"ja, ""pop"" ist es nicht nicht unbedingt, was u2 hier abliefern. nein, die beste stilbeschreibung gelang u2 selber. diese sagten nämlich, sie seien zu diesem zeitpunkt (1997) einerseits von den errungenschaften im bereich der elektronischen musik (the prodigy!), andererseits von der wiederentdeckung des ""klassischen"" songwritings (oasis!) beieindruckt gewesen, und wollten beides auf EINEM album zusammenbringen. u2 spielt oasis meets prodigy."
2,"Vorab, ich bin ein Fan von U2 und die beiden neuen Songs sind echt klasse (ein Stern für jeden neuen Song, dehalb meine Bewertung von 2 Sternen), aber wieder mal is Pride enthalten und wieder mal nicht die Singleversion. Vielleicht sind ja die beiden neuen Songs für einige ein Kaufanreitz, aber die bekommt man auch als Single CD!"
5,"""Kind of Blue"" von Miles Davis hat eine längere Geschichte in meinem Platten- und CD-Schrank. In den frühen Siebzigern hörte ich erstmals diese 'uralten' Aufnahmen - sie stammen aus dem Jahr 1959 - und war sofort verzaubert von dem ruhigen und fließenden Charakter dieser Musik. Der LP folgte die CD-Ausgabe in Gold und dieser dann die hier besprochene. Zu ""Kind of Blue"" ist eigentlich alles gesagt und geschrieben, Miles Davis hat hier zusammen mit Julian ""Cannonball"" Adderley, John Coltrane, Wynton Kelly, Bill Evans, Paul Chambers und Jimmy Cobb ein Album eingespielt, welches als einer der Meilensteine des Jazz zu bezeichnen ist, - die Soli basieren nicht mehr auf Akkordwechseln sondern auf Skalen, was der Musik einen schwebenden Charakter mitgibt. Das Ergebnis ist einfach schön. So ist es nicht verwunderlich, dass dieses Album nun über mehrere Generationen hinweg seine Käufer findet. Die hier vorliegende Ausgabe ist die nach meinem Geschmack gelungendste, der Ton ist klar, das Booklet ist informativ und zudem ist mit einer zweiten Version von ""Flamenco Sketches"" auch noch ein Bonus Track enthalten. Sehr empfehlenswert!"
1,"Die Überschrift sagt es bereits: wer die Sendung zumindest ab den Halbfinals mitverfolgt hat, wird bestätigen können, dass vom künstlerischen Niveau her jemand wie der kleine Teufelsgeiger Lucas den Sieg viel eher verdient hätte. Wenn aber Dieter Bohlen sagt ""Leute, ruft für ihn an"", so ergreift er damit in unzulässiger Weise Partei für einen Kandidaten. Denn was Bohlen empfiehlt, das wählen (und kaufen!) die Leute. Und wenn er sagt, ""Wenn du nicht gewinnst, dann fress ich meine Jacke"", dann sagt das sehr viel aus über die ganze verlogene Maschinerie hinter solchen Casting-Wettbewerben. Und dass die CD nicht mal 1 Woche nach Michael Hirtes Sieg schon im Handel ist, zeigt, dass man vorproduziert hat, egal ob er gewinnt oder nicht, der Mann hat Dieter Bohlens Schützenhilfe sicher gehabt. Mit ihm kann er Kasse machen, mit den anderen Künstlern des Abends nicht. So einfach ist das. Bohlen machte Kasse mit Mark Medlock, jetzt eben mit Michael Hirte. Natürlich rührt uns das Schicksal dieses Mannes, auch Mark Medlock war Hartz IV-Empfänger, aber ich hatte angenommen, hier muss einer, der es bis ins Finale schafft, wirklich etwas können, was so vielleicht keiner mehr beherrscht. Ob Akrobatik, Jonglieren, Magie oder Musikinstrument - zuallererst muss der Künstler die Herzen der Menschen erreichen und sie irgendwie tief berühren. Das haben viele am vergangenen Samstag erreicht. Doch so schön Michael Hirte auch Mundharmonika spielt, er hat für mich technisch keine Chance gegen die wahren Könner und Nicht-Sieger dieser Show, bei denen mir teilweise echt die Kinnlade runterfiel. Den anderen kann ich nur wünschen, dass sie sich alle mit ""Supertalent 2008"" eine Plattform geschaffen haben, die ihre Karriere kräftig beflügelt.  Manch einer wird jetzt seinen eingeschlagenen Weg leichter gehen können. Zu wünschen wäre es ihnen jedenfalls von Herzen. Und dass Michael Hirte jetzt wenigstens die Chance hat, mit seinem üppigen Preisgeld und den Tantiemen vom CD-Verkauf aus dem Schuldenloch rauskommt, ohne verheizt und fallengelassen zu werden."
1,"War der übertrieben gerühmte Erstling der Band bereits recht öde, so ist diese weichgespülte Nachfolgeversion nur noch zu einem gut: Die lieben Kleinen ins Bett zu bringen. Genau die richtige Scheibe für alle Mando Diao-Fans, die gerne ohne ""Rock"" rocken! Alle anderen kaufen sich doch besser die Erste von ""The Flash Express""! Denn die Jungs gehen wirklich ab!"
2,"Riesige Erwartungen habe ich an das Nachfolgeralbum von ""Franz Ferdinand"" gestellt. Leider muss ich sagen, dass diese weitestgehend enttäuscht wurden. Habe das Album zwar erst einmal gehört und deshalb immer noch die wage Hoffnung, dass es vielleicht nach mehrmaligem Anhören besser wird, aber so richtig glauben kann ich das nicht... Während mich das letzte Album, eine Zufallsentdeckung, beim ersten Hören vor einiger Zeit regelrecht umgehauen hat durch seine innovativen Klänge und seine Ohrwurmqualitäten, erfasste mich bei ""You could have it so much better"" gepflegte Langeweile. Die Lieder sind nett, aber klingen irgendwie alle gleich und keins davon konnte mich so richtig begeistern. Von Innovation keine Spur mehr, alles kommt einem bekannt vor und man meint sich zu erinnern, dass es das schon öfter mal gab. Es tut mir sehr leid für die tolle Gruppe aus Great Britain, aber ich glaube nicht, dass ich große Lust habe, mir das Album noch oft anzuhören. Sorry. Natürlich ist es immer schwierig, ein Nachfolgealbum eines Superburners zu produzieren, das den hohen Erwartungen gerecht wird, aber gerade in diesem Fall war ich über die Mittelmäßigkeit des Albums doch sehr enttäuscht.  Fazit: Ich empfehle das Album ""Franz Ferdinand"" uneingeschränkt, dieses hier aber eigentlich nur für Fans der Band. (Die Rezensionen, die behaupten, ""Ychismb"" sei besser als der Vorgänger, sind mir schleierhaft, aber über Geschmack lässt sich ja bekanntlich nicht streiten.) Hoffentlich wird das nächste Album dieser vielversprechenden Band meinen Geschmack wieder besser treffen!!"
5,"Ein absolutes Highlight für Mey-Fans. Besonders, wenn man live dabei war. Danke, lieber guter Reinhard!"
5,"Ich Habe mir die CD gekauft und finde sie SUPER. Sie ist anders als Soundtrack - Save The Last Dance. Sie geht nämlich nicht so richtig in die R&amp;B richtung , aber sie ist genau so gut. Also !!!!!!!!!KAUF' DIR DIE CD!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Was haben Simple-Minds für Supermusik gemacht! Und jetzt solch eine musikalische Bankrotterklärung! Lustlos leiern Kerr &amp; Co. die neun Titel runter, uninspiriert, seelenlos, ohne Höhepunkte, ohne Gefühl - ein musikalischer Brei, der völlig kalt lässt. Hier ist eine großartige Band der 80er dabei, sich selbst zu demontieren. Ich habe die CD blind gekauft - jetzt muss ich meine Gehörgänge erst einmal mit ""Street Fighting Years"" wieder reinigen.  P. S.: Warum kann man eigentlich keine Minus-Sterne vergeben?"
2,"Mit Ihrem beachtenswerten Debüt ""Baduizm"" gab sie der schwarzen Musik neue Impulse. Solch entspannte Kombination von Soul, R&amp;B und Hip-Hop Attitüde kannte man höchstens von den Fugees. Der Nachfolger ""Mama's gun"" war weniger gefällig und mit verstärkten Funkappeal und anspruchsvollen Texten nochmals eine Steigerung. Der dringend erwartete Nachfolger ""World wide underground"" verwendet die gleiche Formel und ist doch ein deutlicher Knick in der Qualitätskurve. Schon die ersten beiden Songs zeigen das Problem. ""Bump it"" beginnt als klassisches Deja-Vu:  perlendes E-Piano, geschmeidige Chöre und zurückgelehnter Hip-Hop-Beat. Doch dann fasert der Song in einen endlosen und uninspirierten zweiten Teil aus, der klingt, als hätte man im Studio einfach das Band weiterlaufen lassen. ""Back in the City"", aus den selben Inhaltsstoffen gemixt, hat schlichtweg keine Songidee und eiert trotz pulsierender Bassline minutenlang auf einem simplen Mitsingrefrain herum. ""I want you"" beginnt wie ein sich langsam steigernder Herzschlag, der zu lange auf einer monotonen E-Piano-Linie verharrt, um dann in einen nicht viel spannenderen Standard Badu-Song zu münden."
2,"...wie man diesem Album mehr als 2 Sterne geben kann. Ich bin In Extremo-Fan seit ""Sieben"", hab mir dann nach und nach alle früheren Platten gekauft und war hellauf begeistert.# Im Dezember 2006 folge dann mein erstes Konzert, 2007 sah ich sie ein zweites Mal. Beide Konzerte waren Wahnsinnserlebnisse, weil ich die Lieder, die ich wochenlang durchlaufen ließ endlich live erleben durfte. Ich gröhlte mit, ging ab und freute mich, mit Gleichgesinnten dieses Erlebnis machen zu dürfen. Kurz: Ich war ein riesiger Fan und dachte, das würde noch lange so bleiben.  ..Doch dann kam Sängerkrieg. Voller Vorfreude kaufte ich mit die CD für 15 Euro bei einem örtlichen Elektronikladen. Sofort fuhr ich nach Hause, legte die CD ein.. und dann kam die Ernüchterung. Schon nach den ersten paar Liedern dachte ich, für dieses Machwerk viel zu viel Geld ausgegebn zu haben. Auch nach 2 weiteren Durchläufen stellte sich bei mir die Freude nicht ein und seitdem vergammelt die CD (verdient) irgendwo in einem Regal. Dass es einige gute Lieder im In Extremo-Stil gibt streite ich nicht ab, aber das Gros der Songs ist nichts weiter als billig produzierter Deutsch-Rock, bei dem hin und wieder ein Dudelsack zu hören ist. Abgesehen davon sind die Texte platt wie nie, pseudo-philosophisch und generell sehr schwach. Von den Englischkenntnissen des Sängers (""An End has A Start"") will ich gar nicht erst anfangen - das hat schon auf anderen Alben den Gesamteindruck nach unten gezogen, aber erst hier merkt man, wie schlecht die Aussprache des Sängers ist und wie wenig das zum Stil der Band passt. Fazit: 2 Sterne für ein paar gute Lieder. In Extremo ist mit diesem Album für mich gestorben, das nächste Album werde ich nicht wieder blindlings am Erscheinungstag kaufen."
2,"Farin ist gut! Farin ist der Ober-ARZT! Vor seinen Qualitäten als Songwriter und Schreiber guter Melodien ziehe ich meinen Hut. Um so mehr enttäuscht mich hier sein neuestes Werk. Die Melodien geben mir keinen Kick. Die Texte? Wirken uninspiriert, die ""Themen"" uninteressant und beliebig. Nette Wortspiele? Fehlen diesmal gänzlich. Hat Farin uns wirklich nichts mehr zu sagen? Hat er nichts mehr zu bieten außer Liedchen über unerfüllte Liebe, Kalenderblatt-Weisheiten oder sonderbar sinnfreie Songs über Gobi Todic (?) oder Pakistan? Kein Wortwitz, keine Spritzigkeit, kein Biss, alles irgendwie gekünstelt ... ""Es schwimmt eine Leiche im Teich ..."" - bitte, bitte lass es nicht Farin sein! Sie sieht nämlich ein bisschen so aus wie er ..."
2,"""Disco Lies"", die erste Single aus Mobys aktuellem Album ""Last Night"", weckte mit seinem erfrischenden und lebensbejahenden Sound noch Vorfreude, gleiches gilt für den ersten Song von ""Last Night"", ""Ooh Yeah"", der ähnlich optimistisch und eingängig daherkommt. Das waren allerdings, zumindest aus meiner bescheidenen Sicht, schon die größten Highlights. Der Rest des 14 Songs starken Albums ist handwerklich solide umgesetzt und als Hintergrunduntermalung nicht störend - von der Machart kann man Moby nicht viel vorwerfen. Aber die einzelnen Titel heben sich weder voneinander besonders deutlich ab, noch haben sie irgendetwas Fesselndes an sich, das sich in den Gehörgang bohrt oder zum mehrmaligen Hören animieren würde. Man kann alles gut hören, aber jegliches Hit-Potential fehlt. Es wäre zu einfach, es Moby zum Vorwurf zu machen, den 80er-Discosound wieder aufgegriffen zu haben - ""Disco Lies"" zeigt ja, wie es funktionieren und auch 2008 noch unverbraucht klingen kann. Genauso dumm wäre es, ""Last Night"" neben ""Play"", ""18"" und ""Hotel"" zu legen, denn der melancholische Stil eines ""Porcelain"" ist ja genau das, was Moby sich mit dieser Platte nicht zum Ziel gesetzt hat. Trotzdem bleibt ""Last Night"" einfach gnadenlos enttäuschend, wenn man weiß, was dieser Künstler für traumhafte Melodien entwerfen kann und wie sicher er sein Handwerk beherrscht. Und es ist noch enttäuschender, wenn die erste Single ""Disco Lies"" exakt vormacht, dass das von Moby angedachte Prinzip sogar wunderbar klappt - warum es auf Albumlänge scheitert und der große Rest des Albums uninspiriert und unauffällig daherkommt, ist ein Rätsel. Moby wird mit ""Last Night"" viele seiner Anhänger enttäuschen. Wäre er ein neu auf den Plan tretender Noname-Newcomer, hätte ""Last Night"" in seiner Belanglosigkeit vermutlich das bekommen, was dem Album am ehesten gerecht wird: Keine Aufmerksamkeit."
5,"Das neue Album von atb ist ein schönes Digipack mit 2 Cds und 1 DVD. Cd 2 ist ein reines Chillout Album und einfach nur wunderschön. Man kann sich bei schönen melodiösen Tracks wunderbar entspannen. Manche sind rein instrumental, manche untermalt mit Gesang. Allein schon wegen Cd 2 lohnt sich der Kauf des Albums! Auf Cd 1 befinden sich schnellere tanzbare Tracks und auch ruhigere.  Für mich als großen Atb Fan ist dieses Album allein schon Pflichtkauf, aber es lohnt sich auf jeden Fall! Es ist für jeden was dabei. Einfach der Hammer."
2,"Wie lange habe ich doch gewartet bis Tiesto seit seiner letzten CD (In Search of Sunrise Asia) eine neue rausbringt. Und nach über einem Jahr ist es nun soweit dass ein weiteres Album von ihm meine ganze Sammlung ergänzt. Aber wie gut passt dieses zu den alten Alben von Tiesto?  Ich bin Tiesto-Fan seit 2001 (glaub ich zumindest :) ) . Das erste mal wo ich was von ihm gehört habe war eine Live-Aufnahme von Dancevalley 2001. Ich habe gleich gewusst, dass er noch einges Tages richtig groß rauskommen wird da er sich ordentlich von anderen DJs und Künstlern der Trance-Szene abgehoben hat. Was hat aber das jetzt mit dieser Bewertung zu tun?  Ich versuche in der Hinsicht sehr neutral zu sein damit jeder trotzdem sein eigenes Bild und Urteil machen kann. Seine bisherigen selbstproduzierten Alben ""Just Be"", "" Elements of Life"" , ""Parade of the Olympics"" und ""In my Memory"" stehen wahrlich für seinen Namen, da seine Lieder im Mainstream, ""Kommerzdiscotheken"" usw. sofort von den anderen abheben und man als ""Eingefleischter"" sofort weis, wessen Lied oder Track gerade aufgelegt wird. Er hat jedes mal seine Musik sowie der der Trance-Szene neu definiert und teilweise wurde auch versucht sein Stil zu kopieren was aber nicht geklappt hat und auch nicht klappen wird (nach diesem Album vielleicht schon) Leider wird Tiesto immer mehr ausgebucht und jettet überall auf der Welt herum, um nicht mehr hauptsächlich in Discos aufzulegen sondern gleich standardweise an Plätzen, die ganze Stadien von der Besucherzahl her füllen könnten (was ich natürlich auch machen würde :) ). Wenn man soviel unterwegs ist und noch an ganz verschiedenen Orten dazu, dann kriegt man meiner Meinung nach auch mit, was gerade in der Musikrichtung Trance, Electro, House, Techno los ist und vor allem was die Menschen mögen und nicht. Und hier kommen wir zum Punkt warum ich nur 2 Sterne gebe: Tiesto ist anscheinend so erfolgsverwöhnt dass er sich dachte, einfach mal was rauszubringen was die Menschen schon mögen werden und von der Richtung her kennen anstatt was ganz Eigenes mit seinem Stil auf den Markt zu bringen. Dabei spreche ich von den Tracks aus den 80er Jahren, die einmal durch die Elektroanlage gejagt und aufbereitet worden sind. Ich denke dabei an das ""San Fransico""-Lied oder das ""We don't need no education"" (Bumm Bumm Bumm Bumm und jeder weis bestimmt was ich hiermit meine, zumindest hoffe ich das) Fast die gesamte CD fällt deswegen in diese Kategorie, da man wirklich meinen kann, dass irgendwelche Lieder von Popstars remixed worden sind um sie als neues Produkt zu verkaufen. Zwar ist trotzdem noch irgendwo was von Tiesto zu hören, aber durch die Melodien, die Gesänge und die Texte ist es für mich kein Trance mehr wie ich es gewohnt bin und vor allem wie ich es von ihm gewohnt bin, sondern ein Produkt aus der Pop-Szene wo er wirklich nichts verloren hat. Zwar sind die Gastsänger und Mitkünstler alle nicht schlecht und ich will sie nicht abwerten, aber ich bin der Meinung, was jetzt diese Rezession hauptsächlich ausmacht, dass Tiesto viel mehr mit solchen Künstlern hätte machen können wo er SEINEN Stil mit denen der anderen NUR GERING vermischt. Dieses Album heißt nun mal TIESTO - KALEIDOSCOPE und nicht NELLY FURTADO - KALEIDOSCOPE oder TEGAN AND SARA - KALEIDOSCOPE  mit FFEATURING TIESTO. Die Chancen auf volle 5 Sterne von mir zu bekommen hätte das Album locker gehabt und er hätte ohne weiteres dieses Album zu seinem Besten machen können, aber er hat sich meiner Meinung dafür entschieden, in den Mainstream unter zu gehen und sich auf die ""Kommerzschiene alà Future Trance, Dream Dance, Tunnel Trance"" zu bewegen, um wahrscheinlich so schnell wie möglich nochmal viel Geld einzukassieren da er weis, wieviele Fans er hat die sein neues Album kaufen würden, gekauft haben und kaufen werden. Allerdings hat Tiesto ein paar ""Standalone""-Tracks zu der CD hinzugefügt, wo man weis und erkennt, dass er alleine bei der Komposition gewirkt hat. Dieser Umstand hat dem Album den zweiten Stern gegeben, und deshalb auch nur zwei und nicht drei, da diese paar ""Single-Artist""-Tracks auch nicht wirklich das Gelbe vom Ei sind. Ich will aber auch jetzt nicht sagen dass dieses Album ein Schrott ist das man gar nicht kaufen soll. Ich muss noch stark erwähnen, dass Tiesto was gewagt hat und es total daneben gegangen ist. Ich hoffe wahrlich das sein nächstes Album wieder so sein wird wie ich es von seinen vorherigen gewohnt bin und wie ich ihn in der Hinsicht kenne.Von da her passt dieses Album nicht zu ihm und ergänzt musikalisch seine vorherigen Alben auch nicht wirklich. Diese Lieder passen gut in jene Discos, die jeden Abend am Wochenende und teilweise unter der Woche die gleichen Lieder spielen und viele tausende 15 - 24 jährige anziehen die von Charts, Pop und Rock sowie deren ""Electro"" nicht genug kriegen und alles, was sie nicht kennen, als ""Scheiße"" bezeichnen. Radikale Tiesto-Fans empfehle ich dieses Album, ansonsten würde ich eher davon abraten es selber zu kaufen sondern es sich lieber schenken lassen :) . Für zwischendurch ist es ausreichend, aber für Dauerbeschallung wo man keinen Ohrwurm kriegen kann eher nicht."
5,"Eine top Agnetha, eine top CD! Super schöne Songs,tolle Stimme, abwechslungsreich, West-Coast Felling, verträumt... Obwohl das Album bereits im Februar 1988 international veröffentlicht wurde, ist es noch immer absolut hörenswert und hat an Charme nichts verloren. Tip!"
2,"Nachdem die CD ""Schau mal, hör mal, mach mal mit!"" von Rolf Zuckowski bei uns der tägliche Renner ist, habe ich ""Starke Kinder"" gekauft und war sehr enttäuscht. Die Lieder ""Starke Kinder"" und ""So wie Du bist"" gefallen mir sehr, den Rest finde ich aber nicht ansprechend und auch mein Sohn war nicht, wie erwartet, begeistert. Schade! Aber ich werd mich trotzdem durch Zuckowskis Werke durcharbeiten ;-)"
4,"Was soll ich zu Till Brönner noch sagen? Diese CD ist mit Abstand das Beste was er bisher veröffentlicht hat. Er hat sich richtig Mühe gegeben. Seine Gastmusiker sind hervorragend! Obwohl der Sound gleichbleibend ist, wird seine Musik nie langweilig. Ein weiteres Highlight sind die Auswahl der drei Sängerinnen - das ist Weltklasse. Till, es wird schwer für dich die Latte noch höher zu hängen! Diese CD bekommt von mir die ""Unbedenklichkeits-Bescheinigung"", weil man sie von Anfang bis Ende genussvoll durchhören kann!! Ein MUSS für jede CD-Sammlung und ein ideales Geschenk für jeden, der Wert auf anspruchsvolle Musik legt. Einen Stern habe ich abgezogen, weil es die CD in zu vielen Versionen gibt. Früher war es schöner, da gab es vom Musiker nur EINE neue Schallplatte und alles war gut ..."
2,"Die ersten Male noch ganz nett, ruhig, so für nebenher... wird aber in seiner Langweiligkeit tatsächlich aufdringlich... das is mir noch nie bei einer ""Hintergrundjazzplatte"" passiert... Auf jeden Fall hab ich sie dann regelmäßig abgestellt. Ich finde auch Brönner kann nicht singen..."
1,"Es gibt schon selten blöde Hits.  So welche, die niemand wirklich braucht. Mich wundert, dass dieser belanglose musikalische Erguss die Charts anführt oder angeführt hat. Hilfe ! Ein Beweis für den Zustand unserer heutigen Musiklandschaft. Erbärmlich schlecht.  Warum ? Ganz einfach. Hier wird sich schamlos bedient bei tausendfach bereits da gewesenem... Was Neues soll das sein ? Alles schon mal gehört. Snap aus den 90ern, Boney M. aus dem 70ern und dazu absolut einfallslose Dancefloor- und unsägliche Apres-Ski-Melodien, die wir ebenfalls schon tausend Mal gehört haben und die uns gerade in den 90ern und auch Anfang dieses Jahrtausends bis zum Erbrechen vollgedudelt haben. Dieses hier ist keinen Deut anders. Dieser Song ist schlicht überflüssig und schlecht. Eine billige, einfallslose Produktion. Erschreckend nur, wie viele das gut finden. Au backe... Arme Musikwelt. Weniger als einen Stern."
1,"Schönes Titelbild, daher der unvermeidliche Stern. Ansonsten: Wie war der Albumtitel? Der Vortrag hat Ähnlichkeit mit dem von Franzl Beckenbauer damals. Immerhin konnte der Fußball."
5,"Nachdem ich einige Ausschnitte der Tour von Ina Müller am Fernsehen gesehen habe, habe ich mir die CD gekauft und bin seid dem ein absoluter Fan von ihr geworden. Die Titel sind durch die Bank weg gut, mal schnellere Stücke, mal Balladen. Mit ihrer super Stimme und guten Texten ist diese CD meine absolute Lieblings-CD geworden. Einfach 5Sterne!"
5,"Fricsay l'incomparable dans une de ses oeuvres fétiches. Couleurs, vivacité, profondeur : tout y est. Y manque simplement un soupçon d'âpreté que je retrouve davantage encore dans sa 1ère version (DG, avec le RIAS, mono) qui reste, au plus haut niveau, ma préférée."
2,"Wer nach dem wunderschönen, ungeheuer relaxten Album ""Wet Dreams"" eine Nachfolgeplatte gleichen Schlags und Qualität erwartet,  wird gnadenlos enttäuscht werden. Kein Piano und Saxophon wie bei der elegischen Vorgänger-CD stehen im Vordergrund, sondern langweilige, belanglose Songs mit unmotivierten Geräuschkollagen, die einem mit der Nase auf Pink Floyd stossen sollen. Auch ich bin der Meinung, dass Rick Wright gemeinhin als Musiker/Komponist unterschätzt wird. Obwohl er (neben David Gilmore) der Liebling  der Floyd-Fans sein duerfte, kommt man trotzdem nicht umhin, die CD als völlig ueberfluessig zu bezeichnen. So sehr es einen schmerzt, denn:     Die nächste CD duerfen wir in ca. 20 Jahren erwarten, falls Herr Wright seinen bisherigen Zeitplan fuer Solo-Veröffentlichungen einhält. Ob wir (und vor allem er) das noch erleben duerfen?"
5,"Ich finde,die ??? und das Gespensterschloß ist eine der besten Folgen überhaupt.Es ist die 11. Folge und sie ist perfekt gemacht.Diese Folge ist nicht nur was für junge Leute,sondern auch was für Erwachsene.Als ich diese Folge das erste mal gehört hatte,bekam ich an manchen Stellen eine Gänsehaut.Außerdem tritt hier das erste mal so richtig ihr Fahrer Morten in Aktion. Die ganze Folge ist wunderbar anzuhöhren. Man kommt voll und ganz auf seine Kosten."
1,"Das ist eine Zumutung, keine Aufnahme aus diesem Jahrtausend sondern wie irgendwann aus den 50ern im Jazzkeller mit einem Taschenrekorder mitgeschnitten......kein Wunder das die Leute keine CDs mehr kaufen !!"
2,"Was soll man hiezu sagen? Bon Jovi, die Country-Schmuse-Rocker schmeißen einen Mitschnitt eines Konzertes ihrer aktuellen ""Lost highway""-Tour in Form einer CD auf den Markt und bescheren somit den Fans wieder ein wunderbares Einkaufserlebnis! Für mich war es das nicht gerade. Überhaupt nicht, als ich die Playlist dieser CD gelesen habe. Die gesamte ""Lost highway""-Scheibe wird herunter gedudelt und nur noch durch ""Who says you can't go home"" und ""It's my life"" unterstützt. Das war für mich dann doch zu viel des Guten! Ich war ja schon von Haus aus nicht unbedingt von diesem Pseudo-Country-Album überzeugt und das Ganze jetzt auch noch als Live-Version vor die Füße geknallt zu bekommen, ist quasi schon eine Überdosis ""Lost highway"". Ich will damit ja nicht behaupten, dass die Songs dieses Albums generell schlecht sind, überhaupt nicht. Doch von einer extrem erfolgreicher Band, wie es Bon Jovi sind, erwarte zumindest ich musikalisch ein wenig mehr, als durchschnittlichen 08/15-Mainstream-Pop, der sich einfach 1000%ig verkaufen lässt! Die Luft ist heraus und somit auch die Freude an Risikobereitschaft und einfach mal etwas Neues zu probieren! Doch lassen wir das. ""Lost highway - The concert"" ist ein gutes Live-Album mit guter Sound-Qualität geworden, das sich produktionstechnisch auf alle Fälle zeigen lassen kann! Das einzige Problem (dafür aber ein großes!) sind für mich die Songs! Ich kann mich mit dieser Allerwelts-Schönrederei-Musik einfach nicht anfreunden, deswegen fällt die Bewertung für dieses Album auch so schlecht aus! Es tut mir leid, meine lieben Bon Jovi-Freunde. Ich will euch hiermit überhaupt nicht verärgern oder vor den Kopf stoßen, auch ich habe alle alten Bon Jovi-Platten zu Hause im Regal stehen und höre mir auch heute noch regelmäßig an, aber ""Lost highway"" ist für mich einfach nicht mehr als schlechterer Durchschnitt!"
2,"Ich will nicht behaupten das ich die ""Softie""nummern von Green Day nicht mag! im gegeteil die sind klasse! und das ist es was ich meine früher konnten Green Day auch ne softe nummer schreiben ohne sich selbst zu wiederholen...was sie mit 21 Guns definitiv gemacht haben!der song ist schlecht! wenn das mal keine wiederholung von ""Wake me up when september ends"" ist!...die angeblich neue B-seite ""Favotite son"" ist nicht neu der song war schon auf dem album ""rock against bush"" drauf!! von daher ist der song nicht ""unveröffentlicht"" der einzige grund warum ich die single überhaupt haben wollte war eben die B-seite! auch wenn das ein bisschen mau ist geb ich zu;) ansonsten ist das hier wirklich schlecht und ich bin echt entäuscht von  meinen sonst so talentierten punx!!"
5,"Ein wirklich wundervoller Song, voller tiefer Gefühle. Für mich einer der schönsten Lieder zum Träumen der letzten Zeit. Gesungen von einem Künstler mit einer Stimme, die in Erinnerung bleibt und die Seele berührt.  KAUFEN !!"
4,"Guten Morgen! Na im Grunde genommen ist das ein sehr hübsches Gesamtwerk, mit sehr lieben Texten und wenn man auf derartige Notenkombinationen, gepaart mit einem zuckersüssen Elfenstimmchen, steht. Es plätschert locker, flockig dahin und verschönert tatsächlich die Zeit. Song No 10 allerdings ist relativ seltsam! Nach kurzem Grübeln - eine der schlechtesten Kopien, falls es denn eine sein soll - ""just like heaven"" von Cure. Why? Ansonsten gibt's nichts zu sagen. Ich mag das Album, Salú, uk"
5,"Klaus Badelt und Hans Zimmer haben mit diesem Soundtrack wirklich ein Meisterwerk geschaffen. Das Maintheme (He's a pirate) ist spektakulär, die Zwischenstücke (Fog bound, Walk the plank) stimmig sind und einfach nur wunderschön, wobei die einzelnen Tracks allesamt ineinander übergehen und quasi ein einziges, 45-minütiges Konzert ergeben."
5,"Die CD ist so, wie ich sie mir vorgestellt habe. Sie war ein Geschenk für meinen Vater und er hört sie sehr gern."
2,"Es handelt sich bei dieser Doppel-CD um die Veröffentlichung von Live-Aufnahmen. Leider lässt die Aufnahmequalität sehr zu wünschen übrig! Starkes Rauschen, verzerrte Musik und auch die Stimme von Pavarotti klingt so, als würden die Mitschnitte aus dem frühen 20. Jahrundert stammen. Schade!!! Nur etwas für wirklich eingefleischte Fans dieses wunderbaren Tenors."
5,"Nachdem der Ohrwurm ""Allein allein"" fast schon nervig ständig im Radio geduldelt wird, überrascht die CD mit grandiosem Pop, einer Mischung aus Indie, Synthie-Pop und opernhaften Elementen aus deutschen Landen. Gänsehautfaktor, immer wieder anders, über allem schwebt die filigrane, fast ein wenig weibliche anmutende Stimme von Sänger Felix Räuber. Wunderschön! Einfach nur empfehlenswert."
2,"als nach jahrelanger pause endlich wieder ein album kam hatte ich mich gefreut ich hatte die hoffnung das sie diesmal net so einen müll machen wie bei 17 days. doch leider wurde ich enttäuscht das album ist zwar besser als 17 days kommt aber nicht an Away from the sun oder the better life ran. generell ist es sehr ""poppig"". es ist anzumerken das ich seit ich the better life gehört habe fan von 3 doors down bin, doch das neue album ist eine frechheit für jeden fan. falls sie noch kein album von 3 doors down haben dann rate ich ihnen vom kauf dieses album ab und empfehle ihnen ""the better life"" und ""away from the sun"""
5,"Sehr, sehr schönes Winter-Album - Weihnachts-Album würde ich es nicht nennen, man kann es nämlich ohne Weiteres auch noch nach der Weihnachtszeit hören - einzig ""Silent Night"" ist schon sehr weihnachtlich. Empfehlen würde ich auf jeden Fall die Deluxe-Edition zu kaufen - die darauf enthaltenen Bonus-Tracks sind die besten des ganzen Albums."
2,"Opulenter Gesang, schwere Chöre und bombastische Instrumente erwartete ich nachdem ich mir die Rezensionen durchgelesen, das Cover angeschaut und die CD auf Empfehlung von amazon gekauft hatte. Was bekam ich? Kitschiges, übertrieben gestyltes Mittelding. Frau Brightmann kann sich nicht entscheiden ob sie, wie im Booklet, düster klingen möchte oder lieber doch nachdenklich und liebeskrank. Der Opener Gothica lässt mich als Fan das Gothmetal und düsterer Klassik hoffen, doch was dann kommt ist einfach nur..schlecht. Natürlich hat sie eine besondere Stimme, die mir aber auch nicht zuspricht - zu glatt, zu soft, zu gekünstelt. Nichts für mich! Das einzige was mir gefällt ist das gecoverte Symphony von Silbermond..Was mir aber von der deutschsprachigen Band als Rockballade aufgemacht sehr viel besser gefällt! Das hätte nicht nochmal gemacht werden müssen."
2,"Mit Blow up your Video wurde bis dahin der absolute Tiefpunkt erreicht in der AC-DC-Historie. Das Album spritzt nur so vor Ideenlosigkeit.Nach dem eigentlich guten Song Who made Who und 2 1/2 Jahren Wartezeit seit dem letzten regulären Album hoffte ich dass es wieder aufwärts gehen würde mit AC/DC - doch wurde ich leider bitter enttäuscht - es ging weiter abwärts und ich hielt das bis dahin schlechteste AC-DC Album in den Händen.Es fehlen die schnellen catchy Boogie-Rock-Songs die die Band früher auszeichneten. Der Anfang ist recht vielversprechend mit den beiden Singles Heatseeker und Thats the way... - doch dann kommen nur noch lahme Ideenlose Songs die einfach nur langweilen (Meanstreak,Go Zone,Kissin Dynamite,Some Sin for Nothin). Es hört sich fast so an als hätte man für die beiden Singles entsprechend lange Zeit beim schreiben aufgebracht und den Rest innerhalb ein paar Tagen komponiert. Die Young/Vanda-Produktion lässt leider auch zu wünschen übrig.Das Drumming lahm und ohne Inspiration und so einfach gehalten wie auch die Songs (lag eventuell auch am damaligen Drummer Simon Wright). Einzig noch die Songs Nick of Time und die Halb-Ballade Twos up wissen noch halbwegs zu überzeugen. Mit Schul-Noten bewerte ich die 10 Songs nach der Reihe folgendermassen:1-2-3-4-5-2-4-3-3-5 Nach diesem misratenen Album ging es mit dem Nachfolger The Razors Edge aber wieder auf die Erfolgsspur zurück. Wegen der beiden hervorragenden Singles kann man sich das Album aber trotzdem zulegen."
5,Was soll man zu Michael Bolton noch groß sagen? Der Name ist Programm und bürgt für Qualität.
2,"Da gibt es einen Künstler, der von fast allen Leuten gemocht oder sogar geliebt wird. Ob sie nun Pop, Rock oder sonstwas hören, Robbie Williams mag eigendlich jeder. Nach sehr vielen guten bis sehr guten Alben macht sich dieser Künstler nun einen Herzenswunsch war, er veröffentlicht das Album bzw. die Musik, die er immer schon mal machen wollte. So war es zumindestens von ihm bei Veröffentlichung von ""Rudebox"" zu hören. Dabei rausgekommen ist ""Rudebox"". Ein platter Disco-Song nach dem anderen. Plastik, Plastik, Plastik. Songs wie `Rudebox` oder `Lovelight` sind kaum zu ertragen. Billiges Synthiegewabber und Robbie singt, als wolle er jetzt bei den Bee Gees anheuern. Ich bin der Meinung, Robbie hat mit ""Rudebox"" einen großen Fehler begangen. Auf jeden Fall hat er sich viele Sympathien verscherzt, die er sich mit Alben wie ""Sing..."" und ""Swing..."" erworben hatte. `I am the king of bongo...` singt er bei `Bongo bong`. Da fragt man sich, ob noch alles gesund bei ihm ist?! O.k., es gibt auch einige halbwegs gelungene Lieder wie z.B. `Viva life on Mars` und vielleicht noch `She`s Madonna`. Die wenigen guten Songs retten das Album noch gerade so. ""Rudebox"" hat sich offenbar gut verkauft, aber die Kritiken sind eher mäßig bis schlecht. Man kann nur hoffen, dass Robbie demnächst wieder richtige Musik macht. Diesen Discomüll will kaum einer. Nur aus Respekt vor dem Künstler und seinem bisherigen Schaffen gibt es 2 Sterne."
5,"Schon seit Langem warte ich auf ein Best-of-Album von Robby Williams! Ich bin kein Fan von ihm, hörte seine Single-Auskoppelungen jedoch im Radio immer recht gerne. Da ich bis jetzt nicht eine einzige CD von ihm habe, kommt mir diese Zusammenstellung seiner größten Hits also gerade Recht! Allen (hier nörgelnden) Fans kann ich nur sagen: seid doch froh, dass Ihr das Geld für die CD sparen könnt, wenn Ihr die ganzen Titel schon zu Hause habt ;o) Allen anderen wünsche ich einen angenehmen Hörgenuss!"
1,Mit dem Produkt bin ich sehr zufrieden. Die Information vor dem Kauf des Produkts hatte ich aus dem Internet. Das Produkt wurde ausführlich dargestellt.
5,"Wer kennt sie nicht, die bittersüße und zauberhafte Geschichte des letzten Einhorns. Es ist großartig, wie allein dieses Album den Film vor meinem geistigen Auge wieder auferstehen liess und wie viel von dem fast magischen Flair des Films diesem grandiosen Soundtrack zu verdanken ist. Wunderschöne Stücke, die die ganze Bandbreite an Emotionen um Traurigkeit, Melancholie, Schwermut und Schicksalhaftigkeit, aber auch Schönheit, Harmonie und Besinnlichkeit abdecken. Stille Stücke wechseln sich mit wahrhaft erhebenden ab und erschaffen damit eine bezaubernde Variation an Instrumental- und Orchestralstücken und nicht zuletzt der hier wahrhaft brillierenden Truppe von America, die alle Gefühlslagen auslotet und teilweise so überirdisch schön gelungen ist, dass ich förmlich in diesen herrlichen Tönen versunken bin. Fazit: Eine bewegende Sammlung von Titeln, die einen nicht mehr loslassen und die wunderschöne Geschichte des letzten Einhorns erst wahrhaft ins Herz eindringen lassen."
1,"revolverheld! unmotivierter, schlecht gesungener song. schamlos bei ""schwarz und weiß"" von pocher abgekupfert und einfallslos produziert. da braucht wohl einer geld und versucht in die fußstapfen der sportfreunde stiller zu treten. vergeblich...bitte abtreten!"
1,...ich finde den Song leider sehr schwach. Auch der Titel von Oliver Pocher is nix.. Checkt doch mal ADLER AUF DER BRUST von den LOLLIES - das könnte der EM-Hit sein !
2,Der USB Stick ist der letzte Hit!!!! Wen mir jemand erklären kann wie ich den Stick in den Schacht bekomme??? Die Freude hierauf ist mir jetzt schon vergangen. Ich habe 5 USB Anschlüsse. 4 davon sind belegt. Für den einzigen freien fehlt mir der Platz für die Riesenkarte. Hier hat Herbie mehr an die Optik  als an die Praxis gedacht.
5,"ich habe von simple plan mehr durch zufall erfahren weil ihre songs auf mtv und co ja nicht besonders oft gespielt werden. also hörte ich mir shut up! im internet an und der song schlug bei mir sofort voll ein!! auf gut glück kaufte ich mir das album und war total begeistert!!! die texte sind tiefgründig und gerade wir teenager können uns mit den meisten identifizieren, die songs gehen echt ab und mit untiled beweisen die jungs dass sie auch eine ernste ruhige seite haben und pierre singt auch noch mit solcher leidenschaft die man bei einer castingband nie hören würde. ich würde mir dass album also auf jeden fall kaufen weil für jeden etwas dabei ist!!!"
1,"Schade eigentlich. Wer ähnlich wie ich, den Werdegang der Band vom ersten Album an verfolgt und geschätzt hat, dem wirds nun ähnlich ergehen wie mir. Mit Rockmusik hat dieses Album leider nichtmehr allzu viel zu tun. Flache Gitarrenriffs, sehr simple, nicht gerade aussagekräftige Lyriks und einen gesamteindruck der der Popmusik sehr ähnelt lassen wahrscheinlich den ein oder anderen Fan enttäuscht in die Röhre blicken."
5,"Ich kann das Album nur weiterempfehlen, es ist jeder Titel für meinen Geschmack auf dem Album toll."
1,"Kann auch nur davor warnen, diese CD zu erwerben, bevor man in die Songs hineingehört hat!! Die Melodien sind größtenteils unstimmig, die Lieder haben ein sehr langsames Tempo, Adele`s Stimme gleicht teilweise einem Krächzen. Furchtbar. Chasing Pavements ist der einzige Song, der gut ist auf dieser CD."
5,"Dieses wunderbare, grandiose Debütalbum von Zascha Moktan ist heute angekommen ... und seitdem höre ich es CD rauf und CD runter. Es ist garantiert eines der besten Alben, die in der letzten Zeit auf den Markt gekommen sind: schöne, feinfühlige und dennoch temperamentvolle Musik, gesungen von einer einzigartigen Künstlerin, die hoffentlich noch ganz viel Musik dieser Art produzieren wird! Auch wenn Musik Geschmackssache ist: Jeder Song auf dem Album ist es wert, in Ruhe und mit Muße gehört zu werden!"
1,"nachdem ""Ayo Technology"" permanent im Radio rauf und runter gespielt wurde, hatte ich mir einiges vom Album erwartet ..... und ich wurde total enttäuscht. 1 mal anhören, und weg damit. die Single-Auskopplung Ayo Technology ist der einzigst hörenswerte Titel des Albums. der Rest gleicht wirklich wie ein Ei dem anderen, lediglich braune oder weiße Eier machen da den winzigen Unterschied. dazu der monotone, runtergeleierte Text. sorry, das kann man sich nicht lange antun. wer gute Musik schätzt sollte hier höchstens zur Single greifen, vom Album aber tunlichst die Finger lassen."
2,"Es war damals schon fast ein Sensation, als DC ihre Debüt veröffentlichten. Die Scheibe schoß (allein schon durch die Videos auf MTV &amp; VIVA) binnen kürzester Zeit auf Spitzenplätze in den Charts.  Nur leider sagen hohe Charts-Notierungen nix über die tatsächliche Qualität einer CD aus. Das Debüt von DC (ich kenne es seit gut 5 Jahren) wartet mit einer netten Sammlung an netten R`n`B-Songs auf, mehr aber leider auch nicht. Mir fehlt es bei den gesamten Tracks an Abwechslung. Und leider fehlte den Produzenten auch der Mut, etwas wirklich neues zu kreieren. Die Scheiben enthält die selben RnB-Frasen die man Jahre zuvor bereits von anderen Künstler in den Charts bewundern konnte. Aber das Konzept ging aber auf und DC waren über Jahren hinweg ein fester Bestandteil der Hitparaden weltweit. Ein weiteren Kritikpunkte liegt auch daran, das es sich bei der Gruppe nicht um vier gleichberechtigte Sängerinnen, was den Songs mit Sicherheit mehr Tiefe verliehen hätte, sondern Beyoncé Knowles (die Tochter des Band-Managers) einen viel zu großen Gesangsanteil hat... FAZIT: hier wäre mehr drin gewesen, wenn man den Mut gehabt hätte jenseits der ausgetretenen R-n-B-Wege zu wandeln"
1,"dazu braucht man keine grossen worte zu verlieren.ein total überschäzter und talentloser bohlen verkauft zig platten.die ""texte"" sind ohne jeglichen anspruch.""musikalisch"" auf tiefstem niveu.traurig,dass sowas hierzulande auch noch gut verkauft wird.armes deutschland. mein tipp:bohlen-produkte stehen lassen und das geld lieber anspruchsvolleren künstlern mit talent zukommen lassen."
5,"Auch wenn es bei Musik natürlich immer Geschmackssache ist und eine Renzension nur bedingt aussagekräftig ist, muss ich sagen, dass mir persönlich der Soundtrack sehr, sehr gut gefällt. Ich hatte zuerst den Film gesehen und danach mir dann den Soundtrack gekauft.  Meiner Meinung nach ist diese Musik wesentlich besser, als vieles von heute.  Die Performance von Reese Witherspoon und Joaquin Phoenix ist ausgezeichnet. Abgesehen von den üblichen Nachteilen, die CDs haben (wie z.B. nicht legal mögliches Rippen - also in MP3 oder OGG umwandeln um diese auf einem MP3-Player zu hören) kann ich diese CD nur empfehlen! 5 Sterne!"
2,"Also Jerry Goldsmith hat sich bei diesem Score nicht wirklich neu erfunden.  Für den Main-Title und die End Credits verwendet er das gleiche Star Trek-Thema aus ""First Contact"". Vor allem bei den End Credits wirkt es so als ob das Orchester mal zwischenzeitlich eine Auszeit genommen hätte, denn dort treten doch einige Fehler beim spielen der Partitur auf.  Daher leider nur 2 Sterne."
5,Diese Sängerin ist einfach wahnsinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Mit liberatio hat sie ein Lied gemacht was meiner meinung nach jeder gehört haben muss
5,"Im siebten Jahr ihres bestehens veröffentlichen Saltatio Mortis unter der Ägide von Thomas Heimann-Troisen (Schandmaul &amp; In Extremo) ihr siebtes Album. Nach der massiven Besetzungsänderung im Letzten Jahr, erhebt sich Saltatio Mortis wie neu geboren aus der Asche und liefert einen Meilenstein in der Geschichte der Mittelalterrockmusik ab. Wo der Vorgänger ""des Königs Henker"" noch sehr düster war und sich ein Stückweit von den Mittelalterlichen Wurzeln der Formatio entfernt, ist man mit ""Aus der Asche"" spielfreudiger und mittelalterlicher unterwegs, ohne das der Rockcharakter darunter gelitten hätte. Dies ist der verstärkten Gitarrenarbeit zu verdanken, die eine zentrale Position auf ""Aus der Asche"" einnimmt. So fressen sich Titel wie ""Spielmannsschwur"" und ""Uns gehört die Welt"" unbarmherzig zwischen den Lauschlappen fest. Zusammen mit der stimmlichen Weiterentwicklung von Alea, wie sie z.B. in ""Prometheus"" gut zu hören ist, sind alle Ingredienzien für ein Hitalbum vorhanden und es müsste doch ein wirklich verflixtes Siebtes Jahr sein, wenn ""Aus der Asche"" nicht einschlagen würde, wie die sprichwörtliche Bombe - das Potential dafür ist jedenfalls vorhanden. Wer übrigens gehofft hat, das es mit ""Aus der Asche"" wieder in die alten, elektronischen Zeiten zurück geht, hat sich getäuscht - es bleibt beim eingeschlagenen Mittelalter-Rock Kurs. Mit ""Aus der Asche"" dürfte sich Saltaio Mortis in die obere Liga der Sackpfeifen-Fraktion gespielt haben - und das sei Ihnen gegönnt. Wer auf eingängigen Mittelalter-Rock mit guter Gitarrenarbeit im Stile der ""großen Drei"" (Schandmaul, In Extremo und Subway To Sally) steht, sollte unbedingt zuschlagen. Vorbei die Zeiten wo sich alles etwas kratzig und gequetscht anhörte - das Oktett hat mit ""Aus der Asche"" ein neues Kapitel in ihrer Bandgeschichte aufgeschlagen und wenn dies so furios weitergeht, wie es begonnen hat, steht uns noch Großes bevor."
1,"Für Schillerfans wohl eher ein Reinfall. Sinnlose Klangcollagen, gepaart mit ein bischen Glöckchengebimmel. Wa soll das? Und dann noch so ein Schmarn mit dem Kopierschutz. Die Musik läuft auf dem PC in einem eigenen Programm was mächtig Systemressourcen verbraucht. Der Klang ist Lichtjahre von der Schillerqualität entfernt. Also. Finger weg."
4,"Es ist ein Gerücht, dass Rob altersbedingt nachlässt. Ich habe ihn 2009 in Dortmund gesehen und war mir mit einer Menge anderer Priest Veteranen einig, dass wir Priest und Rob (ohne Teleprompter!) seit 20 Jahren nicht so gut gesehen habe. Absolut souverän begeisterte Priest die Massen - Heavy Metal Champions League.  Auch auf dieser CD sind die Jungs(!) in Topform. Allerdings hätte ich mir noch ""I'm a Rocker"", ""Worth fighting for"", ""Revolution"" und ""Angel"" gewünscht. Der Sound ist sehr druckvoll und authentisch. Es begeistert mich imemr wieder, welche Perfektion live geboten wird. Rob ist gut - manchmal sogar perfekt. Das von manchem kritisierte ""Painkiller"" ist - man muss es halt live erleben - der Gipfel der Extase. Das Rob dabei das letzte aus sich rausholt, macht ja gerade den Charme aus. Das ist Power ohne Rückscht auf Verluste.  Mein Fazit: Nicht unbedingt die CD für Einsteiger aber ein Muss für Fans."
5,"Eigentlich wurde alles schon gesagt, nur ich bin durch Zufall auf Anouar Brahem gestoßen und so begeistert ... so ein feinfühliger Musiker! Ich bin ganz hin und weg... Eine Mischung aus orientalischer-u. jazziger Musik, auf alle Fälle sehr meditativ und entspannen, aber nie traurig. Das Richtige zum Genießen und Träumen! Im Kopf fährt dabei ein Phantasiefilm ab. Sehr empfehlenswert!"
1,Leider! Diesen Titel kann ich leider nur als völlig überflüssig bezeichen. Zur Belustigung werd ich ihn mir aber immer wieder ansehen! Alles andere haben Kritiker schon vor mir gesagt.
5,".... gestern habe ich, nachdem die CD schon in den vergangenen zwei Monaten einige Male lief, den Film angeschaut und diese wunderbaren Lieder bekommen nun Bilder und damit eine neue Aufmerksamkeit. Wenn man nun nochmal intensiver auf die Texte achtet und dabei die Geschichte des Buches/Films dabei im Kopf hat, muss man zum Schluss kommen, dass dies wirklich grossartige Filmmusik ist. Passend, im Film mittragend und bewegend und fuer sich zum Hoeren auch wunderschoen. Besonders gut ist im Abspann laufend ""Guaranteed"", welches mit seinem Text zusammenfasst und gleichzeitig die eigenen Freiheitsgedanken und den inneren Individualismus anregt.  ""On bended knee is no way to be free"" und ""I knew all the rules, but the rules did not know me"" sagen einiges aus-- aber um alles zu sehen, sollte man CD und Film gemeinsam wahrnehmen. Lohnenswert!!"
1,"...ist das schlecht, mehr fällt mir dazu nicht ein. Doch etwas Positives: Der Flop ist vorprammiert und von Martin Stosch wird man nie wieder etwas hören..."
5,"nachdem ich schon von ""bedingungslos"" total begeistert gewesen bin, freue ich mich sehr über ihr zweites duett ""du bist wie musik"" und hoffe das bald ein album kommt!!!!"
2,"Da haben sich die Popstars Macher ein Jahr lang jede Woche endlos Mühe gegeben eine Band ganz nach ihren Vorstellungen zu schmieden und nun das! Weder Single Nr.1, noch Album oder jetzt Single Nr.2 werden den Pop Olymp erklimmen, sondern im Nirvana des Durchschnitts untergehen. Schade denn die Bandmitglieder hätten wahrlich etwas besseres verdient, hat man ihnen doch eine goldene Zukunft versprochen, wenn sie sich nur anstrengen und hart dafür Arbeiten. Leider hat das Produzententeam die Hausaufgaben wohl irgendwo abgeschrieben, denn anstatt mit der Band eigene Songs zu entwickelt, hat man irgendwelche 08-15 Songs zusammengewürfelt und glaubte damit mit minimalen Kosten das große Geld zu machen. Diesmal ging die Spekulation voll in die Hose. Man kann nur Hoffen, das einige Bandmitglieder daraus lernen und eigene Solokarieren starten... weitweg  von Pro 7 und Co."
1,"Bin ich eigentlich die Einzige die findet, dass dieses Lied so gar nicht geht, weil es sich anhört wie ein Schlager!!!!!!!!!!!!!?????????????? Dieser Beat ist nämlich nichts anderes als ein Schlagerbeat (brrrrr :-(( ) auf den man wunderbar einen Discofox tanzen kann ;-) und immer wenn ich es höre, graust es mir, weil es, wenn es auf Deutsch gesungen wäre, glatt ein Werk von Wolle P. sein könnte!!!!  Also ich habe die NoAngels bisher immer geliebt und fand bisher jedes Lied von ihnen mindestens gut, doch wenn sie jetzt diese Schiene einschlagen wollen, dann sind die Mädels für mich Geschichte. :-(((  Na immerhin passen sie damit zum Grand Prix da haben die Deutschen bisher immer mit Schrott gepunktet man nehme doch nur Nicole, die auch mit ähnlicher Musikrichtung gewonnen hat. :-( Für mich sind die NoAngles mit diesem Lied jedenfalls eine große Enttäuschung und ich hoffe nur, dass dieser Ausflug in den Schlagerbeat-Bereich nur ein ganz böser Ausrutscher ist und sie sich zukünftig wieder dem Pop zuwenden werden."
5,"Ich hab das Album zum Geburtstag bekommen und dachte erst mal am Anfang, dass das nicht ganz meinem Geschmack entspricht, aber jetzt bin ich angenehm überrascht! The Impossible Dream - hammer starke Ballade, die man sich tausend mal anhören könnte - 5 Sterne Soothe my soul - schneller Song, der jeden in gute Laune versetzt - 5 Sterne Your precious love - ein schönes duett, was am Anfang sich ein bisschen langweilig anhört, aber sich dann super steigert - 5 Sterne Get it right - schneller, eingängiger Song - 4 Sterne Part time love - sie ist die königin der balladen, was sie hier mal wieder beweist - 5 Sterne Sexual Healing - der song hat einfach etwas - 5 Sterne Son of a Preacher Man - geiler Song, der einzige den ich auch im Orginal kannte - 5 Sterne Soulicious - gleichnamiger Song zum Album, hat aber nicht ganz meine Erwartungen erfüllt - 4 Sterne Love on a two way street - starke ballade - 5 Sterne One day I'll fly away - schöne eingängige melodie - 5 Sterne I've got to use my imagination - ein schneller song, den man brauchte nach diesen balladen - 5 Sterne I never loved a man - ein tolles lied, dass sarah's starke stimme gut unterstreicht - 5 Sterne Same old Story - durchschnittlich - 4 Sterne If it's magic - der stärkste song des albums HAMMER!!! - 5 Sterne Fazit: Man muss diese Art von Musik mögen, um das Album zu mögen. Und man sollte es sich öfters anhören, aber dann ist echt gut. Das Orchester und Sarah's gute Stimme macht das Album zu einem ihrer besten. Den Schmerz den sie in letzter Zeit erleben musste, macht ihre Stimme irgendwie noch besser und hörenswerter. Dazu ist das Booklet und die ganze CD sehenswert. Runde Ecken, schöne Fotos und andere Specials machen das Album auch vom äußerlichen perfekt. Sterne: Macht 4,7 Sterne, d.h. 5 Sterne. Gratulation, Sarah!"
2,"1999 machte sich die junge Christina mit ""Genie in a Bottle"" einen Namen im Musikbiz.Der Song wurde weltweit ein sehr großer Hit für Christina.Im gleichen Jahr erschien ihr Album ""Christina Aguilera"" und machte sie zu der neuen Popqueen neben Britney Spears.Augekoppelt hat sie noch ""Come on Over( All i want is you)"" und ""What a Girl wants""... Jetzt bewerte ich ihr Album ""Christina Aguilera"": 1. Genie in a Bottle 10/10 2. What a Girl wants 8/10 3. I turn to you 3.5/10 4. So Emotional 5.5/10 5. Come on over( All I want is you) 6/10 6. Reflection 7.5/10 7. Love for all Seasons 4/10 8. Somebody's Somebody 2/10 9. When you put your Hands on me 4/10 10. Blessed 7/10 11. Love will Find a Way 3.5/10 12. Obvious 1/10 Für mich ist es die schwächste Christina Aguilera Cd.Ich kann das gut beurteilen,da ich alle ihre Alben habe....Am besten gefällt mir von der Cd ihr erster großer Hit ""Genie in a Bottle"". Ich rate vorher ins Album reinzuhören!"
1,"Solche Musik und sloche Bands gehören schlichtweg verboten. Bei einem solchen Album kann man sich als Freund anständiger Musik jegliche Sachlichkeit sparen! Eine Coverversion jagt die andere und alle prügeln sich um die Krone des schlechtesten Tracks... Wie kann ein Mensch mit funktionierenden Gehörsinn und einem halbwegs vorhandenen Gehirn sich nur so etwas anhören? Eine dreiviertel Stunde lang wird dir der 4/4 Takt um die Ohren gehauen, den man auch eine dreiviertel Stunde lang mitklatschen kann, ohne, dass man irgendwie das Tempo ändern , oder sich auf anderweitige störende Abwechslung im Programm vorbereiten muss. Dann ist da noch dieses Blonde Mädel, das wahrscheinlich irgendwie richtig geil rüberkommen soll, was aber nicht ganz zieht und somit auch nichts übrig bleibt, was über ihr fehlendes Talent auch nur einen Ton zu treffen hinwegtäuschen könnte. Wäre dieser ganze Mist jetzt von dieser ""Band"" selbst erschaffen, dann könnte man ihnen wenigstens einen Funken Kreativität zusprechen, doch leider handelt es sich um eine Handvoll langweilige Cover Versionen... da bleibt nur noch einwas zu sagen:  DURCHGEFALLEN, TOTALER MÜLL, TOTALE VOLKSVERBLÖDUNG!"
1,"Die neuen Stücke werden eingerahmt von bekannten Tracks, die schon auf alten Alben veröffentlicht wurden. Hier hat einer geschrieben Kates Stimme sei reifer geworden - ich kann nur sagen die neuen Stücke sind alle im Unterton depressiv und lahm. Wo ist nur der jugendliche Schwung geblieben? Gerade durch die Mischung mit den alten Stücken wie Libertine, die vor Kraft nur so strotzen wird der Unterschied zu den neuen Tracks frappierend offensichtlich.  Kate wo bist du nur geblieben?"
1,Muss man nicht haben hat man eine hat man alle. Kaum unterschiede zu den anderen CD's.
4,"Terius Youngdell Nash aka The Dream kommt nun aus dem Hintergrund ins Rampenlicht. Vor Monaten noch für den Sommerhit des Jahres schlechthin ""Umbrella"" von Rihanna verantwortlich und auch in vielen weiteren Produktionen in diesem Jahr beteiligt u. a. J. Holiday's grandiose Single ""Bed"" kommt nun sein Debut Album ""Love Hate"" was in vollem Titel ""Love me all summer, hate me all winter"" heißt. Mit diesem Werk hat der Gute ein solides Werk hingelegt was durch einige frische Songs besticht. Die erste Singleauskopplung ist der Track ""Shawty is da shit"" mit Brooklyn Rapper Fabolous, ein schöner laid back Track bei dem Fab's Raps gut mit The Dreams Gesang harmonieren. Eigentlich ist hier für jeden was dabei...wen es auf die Tanzfläche ziehen soll der hört sich einfach ""Fast Car"" oder ""Ditch Dat"" an, wers etwas chilliger mag greift einfach zu den gefühlvollen Slow Jamz ala ""Falsetto"", ""Luv Songs"", dem genialen Duett ""Livin a lie"" mit Rihanna"" oder dem zum Abschluss nochmal wunderbar zum träumen einladenden Song ""Mama"". Ein bisschen Down South mit RnB vermischt kommt dann wohl bei ""I luv U girl"" und ""Play in her hair"" durch mit Finger Snaps und bei den Songs ""She needs my love"" und ""Purple Kisses"" erkennt man ganz klar The Dreams Handschrift durch, denn diese Songs ähneln vom Beataufbau her sehr an das am Anfang schon erwähnte ""Bed"" von J. Holiday. Als Fazit bleibt mir da zu sagen: The Dream gelingt mit seinem Debut ein gutes Werk das sich in einem Jahr 2007 voller RnB Highlights mit in den oberen Rängen einfindet. PeAcE"
4,"Also ich muss nur sagen das KSE immer besser wird. Eine perfekte Mischung aus Hardcore und Metal. Als ich das erste Mal ein Lied von KSE (The End Of Heartache) hörte bin ich sofort in ein Geschäft gerannt und hab mir das Album gekauft. @ Licht Rock Ruldolph: Nein ich glaub nicht das deine Anlage kaputt ist, denn ich hör dieses ""blubbern"" auch und ich stimme auch zu das ich eigentlich nur noch drauf achte wenn ich das Lied höre. Ziemlich nervig...Ich würd mal sagen das ""The Arms Of Sorrow"" ""This Is Absolution"" ""Break The Silence"" und ""Reject Yourself"" am besten sind. Dieses Album ist mehr melancholisch und emotional aber trotzdem ist es sehr gut. Ich rate alle Rock und Metal Fans dieses Album zu kaufen, oder wenigstens anzuhörn. Aber trotzdem 1 Punkt abzug. Ohrwürmer sind garantiert Peace out.. Michelle"
5,"Seit ewigen Jahren schlagen sich die Techno- und Metal-Fans gegenseitig buchstäblich die Köpfe ein, und wünschen sich dabei stets die Pest an den Hals. Freunde werden diese beiden Musik-Szenen zukünftig sicher nicht werden. Dennoch gibt es heutzutage immer mehr Bands, die heftige Stromgitarren-Mucke mit tanzfähigen Elektronic-Beats zu kombinieren wissen. Was damalige Pioniere wie PITCHSHIFTER begonnen haben, führt das britische Quartett ENTER SHIKARI auf ihrem zweiten Album ""Common dreads"" zu einer perfekten Symbiose. Mal ganz ernsthaft, noch nie zuvor ist einer anderen Band eine derart furiose und authentische Genre-Verbrüderung gelungen, wie auf diesem tollen 50-Minüter. Geht nicht - gibt's nicht !!! Und auch wenn ""Common dreads"" erst seit einigen Wochen in den Plattenregalen steht, lege ich mich bereits jetzt fest, dass diese Scheibe in einigen Jahren Klassiker-Status erreichen wird. ENTER SHIKARI agieren auf den 15 Tracks absolut ""open minded"" - und treten dabei alle bestehenden Klischees traditioneller Rock/Metal-Musik quasi mit Füßen. Das dies natürlich auch eine Vielzahl Nörgler und Puristen auf den Plan rufen dürfte, ist daher schon so sicher, wie das Amen in der Kirche. Und all diejenigen sollten ""Common dreads"" auch tunlichst meiden, wie der Teufel das Weihwasser. Es ist ja im allgemeinen sehr schwer, Musik überhaupt mit Worten zu beschreiben. Bei ENTER SHIKARI ist es jedoch noch schwieriger - beinahe schon unmöglich. Versuchen möchte ich es dennoch. Also wer sich da draußen ein komprimiertes, fett-rockendes, unglaublich detailverliebtes ""joint venture"" aus Bands wie THE PRODIGY , BILLY TALENT , SCARS ON BROADWAY , LINKIN PARK (vor allem die Refrains!) , CHEMICAL BROTHERS , LOSTPROPHETS , DUB WAR , FAITHLESS , SYSTEM OF A DOWN , SENSER , CLAWFINGER und alten MY CHEMICAL ROMANCE vorstellen kann, der sollte sich umgehend in den Plattenladen seines Vertrauens begeben, und ""Common dreads"" abgreifen. Songs wie das geile Einstiegs-Triple ""Solidarity"" , ""Step up"" , ""Juggernauts"" sowie die hitverdächtigen Tanzflächenfeger ""No sleep tonight"" , ""Antwerpen"" und ""Hectic"" (Oberhammer!!!) explodieren förmlich vor musikalischem Input, und entwickeln in Dauerrotation allerhöchstes Suchtpotential. Bei Tracks wie ""Wall"" und ""Gap in the fence"" gehen ENTER SHIKARI dann etwas gemäßigter zu Werke, und laden zu kleinen Trance-Spazierfahrten ein. Während ""Havoc A"" und ""Havoc B"" nichts als reinster Trip-Hop sind, brilliert das durchgeknallte ""The jester"" dafür mit einem Mix aus feinen Big-Band-Arrangements, fiesem Aggro-Riffing und irren Computer-generierten Melodien. Eigentlich ist es kaum zu glauben, was diese Band auch anpackt...es funktioniert einfach !!! Lediglich den etwas zu abgedrehten Nerven-Zwirbler ""Zzzonked"" hätte man sich verkneifen können.  Wer hinter diesem genreübergreifenden Sound-Overload jetzt eine reine Spaßtruppe vermutet, der ist übrigens komplett schief gewickelt. ENTER SHIKARI nehmen ihre Sache nämlich bierernst. Schon das bedeutungsschwangere Intro ""Common dreads"" - basiert auf der eindeutigen Message ""We must unite!"" - macht  bereits zu Beginn unmissverständlich klar, dass die Briten in ihren Songs auch politische Inhalte transportieren. Diese Band hat tatsächlich einiges zu sagen...und das macht das Gesamt-Paket ENTER SHIKARI umso interessanter.  Fazit: Geile Band, geile Scheibe, geile Sache !!! Die Chart-Offensive kann hiermit beginnen."
1,"Und wieder ein Vertreter des Modern Industrial Metal Subgenres. Gute Rezensionen und Bewertungen haben sie mit ihrer Thrashriff- Popmelodie- Mixtur bislang bekommen.  Von mir werden sie keine gute bekommen. Wieso?  Nun ja, rein objektiv sind sie sicher super. Sie haben sehr nette Riffs im Gepäck. Schön brachial, mit viel tief gestimmten Gitarren und viel Double Bass- Gedonner. Überhaupt macht das Schlagzeug seinen Job gut, es ist variabel und rythmisch exakt, keine Frage. Dazu kommen dezente Synthies, die immer im Hintergrund bleiben und die Atmosphäre des Gesamtklangs unauffällig beleben, nicht schlecht. Und dann ist da noch der Sänger der ein sehr guter energischer und aggressiver Shouter ist und ebenso super singen kann. Fast schon ein Goldkelchen.  Auch die trockene, klare Produktion lässt nicht zu wünschen übrig.  Tja, was ich mich nur frage: Wieso kann ich eine Scheibe der Demanufacture- Gedenk- Kapelle Kryoburn einlegen und habe trotzdem das Gefühl, etwas Eigenständigeres zu hören, als Under Reprisal? Weil das Songwriting ,gelinde gesagt, unter aller Sau ist. Ich habe einfach irgendwann keine Lust mehr ständig harte Strophen und melodische Refrains zu hören. Zwar knüppeln Threat Signal auch ein paar Songs durch. Aber das reicht kaum als Alibi. Gerade dann nicht, wenn das Riffing so simpel und langweilig ist, dass ich bei den meisten Songs fast einschlafe. Und gerade dann nicht, wenn die Melodien so penetrant sind, als würden sie vom neuen Album von Britney Spears stammen. Entschuldigung, ich will diese Band nicht ihre Glaubwürdigkeit absprechen. Aber so total ohne Bridge und Melodiebogen einsetzende, schmalztriefende Gesangslinien auf Weichspülgitarrenmelodien kann ich nicht ernst nehmen. Es klingt, man verteufele mich dafür: mächtig nach Komerz. Wenn die Band anfängt, etwas komplexeres und effektiveres Riffing einzusetzen, Melodiebögen einbaut und sich etwas erwachsenere Melodien einfallen lässt, könnte es beim nächsten Album was werden. Das Potential vorhanden ist, merkt man ja bereits am Opener Rational Eyes. Dieses Album jedenfalls ist eher ein Schuss in den Ofen."
2,"Ich bin schon seit vielen Jahren ein großer Fan von Tina Turner. Leider mußte ich feststellen, daß dieses wohl mit Abstand die schlechteste Platte von ihr ist. Voller Freude habe ich ihr neues Albumm erwartet und dann das! Vollkommen lustlose Popmusik ohne jede Emotion oder Innovation. Fast jedes dieser Lieder könnte uneingeschränkt auf einem Rummel als Begleitmusik zum Autoscooter gespielt werden. Ich hoffe wirklich, dasß Frau Turner ihre Karriere doch noch nicht beendet und uns zum Abschluß noch eine schönes Album präsentiert."
1,"also beim besten willen nicht!  schon allein das geniale lied von bonnie tyler so schrecklich zu covern ist echt eine schande !!! jungs, das könnt ihr echt besser! für mich ein kläglicher versuch, mit anderer leute songs, nochmal irgendwie geld zu scheffeln...."
5,"Was hatte Nick Barrett 2008 eingepfiffen, dass ihm die Ideen nur so kamen?  Nach dem rockigen Einstieg ""Indigo"" gehen die Stücke mehr oder weniger  ineinander über so dass man getrost von einer Prog-Symphonie reden kann.  Und von was für einer. Hier wird alles was möglich ist an Prog-Elementen  angeboten, Metal,Heavy,Soft,Melancholie,Pathos,Bombast und verschiedene Stimmungen und Atmosphären nehmen uns mit auf eine nie langweilige Reise  noch versüsst mit einmaligen Gitarrenmelodien-und Sounds.  Auch vom Keyboard her hört man die wunderbarsten Sounds, die für die  Atmosphären verantwortlich zeichnen. Der Gesang klingt durch Verfremdung manchmal wie nicht von dieser Welt.  Vom Rhythmus her vernimmt man feinste Drumpatterns und Bassläufe.  Mehr kann man von einer Hyperscheibe wirklich nicht erwarten und  deshalb sage ich, wie hier im Ruhrgebiet üblich:""Schappoohhh ächt"".  Nick Barrett - Guitars, Vocals, Keyboard Programming  Peter Gee - Bass  Clive Nolan - Keyboards, Back.-Vocals  Scott Higham - Drums, Back.-Vocals"
1,"Nur keine Experimente! Nur, so kann sich der geneigte Zuhötrer erklären, daß die Band um den Gitarristen Stephen Wilson mit jedem neuen Album so klingt wie das vorherige Werk. Natürlich zitiert Wilson seit 1986 Musikstile die zum Mainstream wurden. Waren seine Solowerke anfangs von Trance und Ambient geprägt, so pflegt er seit Jahren im Kreis seiner Band epische Prog-Rockstile. Was mit ""Signify"" noch spannend geriet und bei ""Absentia"" faszinierend brachial ausfiel, schrummelt nun unentschieden hin und her. Immer wieder klingts nach Pink Floyd, wie bei dem Stück ""Time Flies"", das in Teilen an ""Sheep"" von P.F. erinnert. Ständige Fremd- oder Selbstzitate aus vergangenen Alben sind einfach zuwenig, um weiter anerkennende Aufmerksamkeit zu erhalten. Die Band tritt auf der Stelle und kann sich nur weiterentwickeln, wenn eine stilistische Öffnung erfolgt oder sie legt die Instrumente beiseite."
5,"Schöne, handgemachte Musik mit nie langweiligen Texten. Gute Zusammenstellung. Empfiehlt sich, um seinen Kindern oder Enkeln einmal zu zeigen, worauf man 'mal stand, als man noch jünger war ;-)"
5,"Auch wenn die augenscheinlich ""erste"" Single den Eindruck vermittelt, dass der Protagonist die ausgetretenen Fußstapfen von Jack Johnson und Konsorten versucht zu füllen, so sei hier gesagt, dass Pohlmann eine neue Sparte aufgemacht hat. Wer in Deutschland Soul sucht, der sollte Pohlmann finden. I love your sound brother... Vielen Dank Hank Hanson"
2,"Das war klar, nach den kommerziellen Riesenerfolgen von Amy und Duffy folgen jetzt immer mehr leicht quäkende 'Soulstimmen', so dass zumindest mir der neu entdeckte Soul der 60er schon gehörig auf die Nerven geht. Sicher, auch dieses Album hat neben reichlich Füllmaterial auch drei, vier wirklich gute Songs zu bieten (dafür die 2 Sterne), aber generell reichen mir doch maximal zwei Alben dieser Stilrichtung. Diese Aufgabe haben die oben genannten Künstlerinnen bereits erfüllt. Abgesehen davon ist 'Lessons To Be Learned' doch um einiges schwächer als 'Back To Black' von Amy Winehouse oder 'Rockferry' von Duffy. Die Stimme ist für eine 16jährige allerdings beachtlich - mit etwas mehr eigenem Stil kann da sicherlich noch was kommen!"
5,"Dieses Album ist mit Sicherheit ein Meisterwerk, wenn auch ein sehr zurückhaltendes, wenn man das so sagen kann. Die Musik ist gefällig, doch nicht anbiederisch, und erschließt sich erst bei mehrmaligem Hören so ganz."
5,"Ähnlich wie beim DA-VINCI-CODE ist auch die Kusik zu Illuminati wieder einfach nur genial! Froh war ich vor allem darüber, dass die Themen aus dem DA-VINCI-CODE wieder aufgenommen aber doch total anders umgesetzt wurden! Abwechslungsreiche und sehr eingängige Musik, die man auch ohne den Film gesehen zu haben prima hören kann!"
5,"Als ich den englischen Trailer von „Harry Potter und der Gefangene von Askaban"" zum ersten Mal sah, ist mir sofort der phantastische Soundtrack in Erinnerung geblieben... besonders das von einem Kinderchor gesungene „Double Trouble"" hat mich von Anfang an beeindruckt.  Umso mehr habe ich mich gefreut, es endlich im richtigen Film zu hören (leider auf Deutsch, aber im Abspann durfte ich dann doch noch mein Lieblingslied auf Englisch genießen!). Die Musik der vorigen „Harry Potter""-Filme war auch sehr gut (John Williams ist halt ein Profi!), aber die Originalität dieses Soundtracks übertrifft alles Vorherige bei weitem!  Mit „Double Trouble"" hat Williams ein zweites, genauso einprägsames „Harry Potter""-Thema kreiert, das mit seinem mittelalterlichen Flair den kompletten Soundtrack des dritten Filmes durchzieht (z.B. „Secrets of the Castle"", „Hagrid the Professor"",...). Der Text des Liedes stammt teilweise aus William Shakespeares „MacBeth"", was ich sehr passend finde (J.K. Rowling hätte es bestimmt auch so gemacht, hätte sie daran gedacht einen Kinderchor in ihre Geschichte einzubauen)!  Auffallend ist auch, dass in diesem Film sehr viele atemberaubend schöne Melodien verwendet werden, von monumentalen (z.B. „Buckbeak's Flight""... wer kann sich diese Szene nicht bei dieser Musik lebhaft vor seinem inneren Auge vorstellen?) zu sehr feinfühligen und verträumten (z.B. „A Window to the Past"", „The Patronus Light"", „Forward to Time Past"",...).  Das eigentlich „Harry Potter""-Thema darf natürlich auch nicht fehlen („Lumos! (Hedwig's Theme)""), diesmal jedoch mit einer etwas anderen Instrumentation.  Außerdem gibt es diesmal einige eher ungewöhnlich Stücke (vor allem, wenn man die aus den ersten beiden Teilen eher gleichmäßige musikalische Untermalung gewöhnt ist), wie „Aunt Marge's Waltz"" und „The Knight Bus"" (eine eher jazzige Nummer) zu hören, was jedoch deutlich zur Atmosphäre des Filmes beiträgt. Fazit: DAS ist Magie! Dieser Soundtrack hat es in sich! :) Ich bin mehr als begeistert und kann nur jedem empfehlen, sich dieses kleine Meisterwerk anzuhören!"
2,"Na ja, das Jahr 2006 bot wirklich nicht die Fülle an Superhits, die man in 10 Jahren noch immer gerne auflegt (wenn man einmal von den WM-Hits absieht). Aber dennoch einige mehr, als hier vertreten sind. Wo ist Mattafix mit Big City Life oder Gnarls Barkley mit Crazy oder Texas Lightning mit Never Never oder Shakira mit Hips Don't Lie oder ... Statt dessen Coverversionen ohne Ende! Beispiele? Bitte: Just Be Good To Me (Mit Melodie von Polices Every breath you take und Text von Beats International) oder JaJa (ein billigster Abklatsch von Vanilla Ice mit Ice Ice Baby - mach draus wörtlich ""Scheiß Scheiß Baby"" - Oh Gott) oder Chori Chori (mit der Melodie von Snow - Informer) oder ... Und warum der Song Schwarz und Weiß am Ende der zweiten CD nochmals in englisch mit Black and White draufgenommen wurde, weiß wohl auch nur der Produzent. Eine Frechheit! Ein Lob dagegen für die Reihenfolge der Tracks. Sie passen prima hintereinander und könnten sogar so gemixt werden. Schön auch, dass sich Songs wie Horny As A Dandy (jaja ich weiß, auch eine Art Cover) oder wirkliche Hits wie I Don't Feel Like Dancin', Precious, Schwarz und Weiss, Hard Rock Hallelujah, Uhn Tiss Uhn Tiss Uhn Tiss und El Temperamento auf die Scheibe verirrt haben. Aber das kann man ja auch von einem Best-of-2006 wohl erwarten. Die Bravo-Hits bieten da einige Perlen mehr! Jedoch fehlen da auch Mattafix mit Big City Life oder Gnarls Barkley mit Crazy. Was ist bloß aus der Qualität der früheren Jahresrückblicke geworden?"
2,"Mitten im Sommer versucht die Bravo-Redaktion eine ""sommerliche"" CD zu releasen. Was beim Design ganz gut gelungen ist, wird musikalisch kaum umgesetzt. Zu finden sind, welch Überraschung, nutz- und hirnloser deutscher Hip Hop und seichte Schmuseballaden von Möchtegernkünstlern wie Fady Maalouf. An dieser Stelle fragt man sich wirklich, welche Zielgruppe(n) mit dieser CD angesprochen wird/werden? Die Antwort liegt klar auf der Hand: 14-Jährige pubertierende Hormonmonster, die Null Ahnung von Musik haben, täglich VIVA und sonstige Hirnlos-Sender vergöttern und jeden kommerziellen Blödsinn anschaffen, die ihnen die Werbung vorpredigt. Genau in dieser Linie liegt auch diese CD. Liebe Bravo-Redaktion: Wann beginnt ihr endlich eine ernste Serie herauszubringen, die auch wahre Musikkenner wie mich befridiegen?"
5,"Ich habe mir jetzt schon einige der FTs gekauft, und wurde noch nie enttäuscht. Dieses mal hab ich mir nicht mal die Trackliste druchgelesen. Es ist jedes mal ein guter Mix der aktuell angesagten Tracks."
1,"so langsam reichts dann auch. das was in dieser folge storymäßig weiterentwickelt wird, dient mittlerweile nur noch als trägermasse auf der der zähe brei aus blut und knochen und so weiter ausführlich weiter dargestellt wird. mittlerweile ist meine these zu dieser serie, dass hier nur möglichst viel ga-ga-gore nach aussen getragen werden soll, was ich als grundidee dann ja auch wieder ganz putzig finde. das ist letztendlich aber weder spannend noch gruselig, bestenfalls eklig oder zeitweise unfreiwillig komisch. den einen punkt weil, ich muß und für den erzähler, der hoffentlich ausreichend verdient, da er ja schließlich die ganze zeit diese eseleien verzapfen muß."
5,"Um es gleich vorweg zu nehmen, THE RAPTURE überzeugen nicht gerade durch ihr Songwriting. Es scheint, als seien ihre Texte nur Mittel zum Zweck, die Umrahmung ihrer Musik - nicht mehr.  Jedoch überzeugen THE RAPTURE mit ihren Groove, der hinterrücks in die Beine geht und einem unweigerlich tanzen lässt. Das Album erinnert stark an THE MUSIC und RADIO 4, unterscheidet sich von denen jedoch durch mehr Abwechslung. So findet man zum Beispiel eine wunderbare Balladen (Open up your heart) die auch von COLDPLAY oder TRAVIS stammen könnte.  THE RAPUTURE werden deinen Herbst retten!"
2,"Meiner ansicht nach lohnt es sich nicht eine lange Rezension zu schreiben,ebensowenig lohnt sich der Kauf. Mag ja sein das sein Storytelling gut ist, aber wenn ich Geschichten hören will dann lese ich Gedichte oder Romane. Die Scheibe ist dermaßen langatmig und viel zu RnB- artig. Die meiste Zeit singt The Streets schlecht vor sich hin,die Beats sind flach und öde im Gegensatz zu seinen vorherigen Alben. Ich war schlicht entäuscht oder man könnte sagen The Streets goes Softie Pop...schwaches Album!"
5,"Hinter dem Namen ""The Streets"" vermutet man eher schwarze Rapper aus den Straßen eines Ghettos als den milchgesichtigen Briten Mike Skinner.  Dieser lebt auch noch in einem Vorort Londons, macht aber eines der besten Black Music Alben des Jahres. Mit seinem breiten Working Class Slang erzählt er authentische Geschichten über das alltägliche Leben zwischen Freundin und Geldproblemen.  Diese Geschichten werden untermalt von 2Step, Garage und HipHop-Beats, die allesamt cool und innovativ sind. Und mit dem souligen ""Dry Your Eyes"" zeigt er, daß er auch ein trauriges Liebeslied schreiben kann.  Ein wohltuendes Album im sonstigen amerikanischen HipHop-Einerlei."
5,"Wahre Lobeshymnen sind hier zu lesen über dieses Werk, und zurecht! Eigentlich unmöglich, solche Musik zu erfinden, denkt sich der eine oder andere. Einfach genial, wie Radiohead dem Etikett ""Britpop"" - bis dato (fast) ausschließlich assoziiert mit Blur /Oasis - eine ganz neue Dimension gab (und ich habe den vollkommen subjektiven Verdacht: absichtlich und bei vollem Bewusstsein!).  Welche andere Band hätte die Klasse gehabt, einerseits mit ""Paranoid Android"" das britische Klangerbe um wahnwitzige Remeniszenen an ""QUEEN"" zu erweitern (erinnert sei an musikalische Kurzdramen wie ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", ""The Prophet Song"" oder ""White Man""), andererseits in ""Karma Police"" den Beatles-Klassiker ""Sexy Sadie"" so gekonnt zu fleddern, dass es (ausser mir)niemandem aufgefallen zu sein scheint!   Freilich, das alleine macht eine Band nicht genial. Alles andere wurde ja aber bereits von anderen gesagt oder ist eben schlicht - unbeschreiblich."
2,"wenn man es mit den beiden anderen Culcha Alben vergleicht und das empfindet jeder den ich kenne, der die bisherigen Long-Player geliebt hat genauso. Nach mehrmaligem anhören finden sich allerdings wenigstens einzelne Songs die ganz Okay sind, aber trotzdem kaum mit der bisherigen Culcha Musik vergleichbar."
5,"Die Ohrbooten kann man schlecht in eine Schublade stecken. Ich bezweifle auch das diese das möchten. Die Musik ist ein Mix aus Ragee, Hip Hop und Pop. Ich habe die Scheibe jetzt seit mehreren Monaten und ich kann mich immer noch nicht satt hören. Die Ohrbooten schaffen es einfach gute Laune zu verbreiten. Es gibt auch - einige wenige - ernsthafte Lieder, die sind aber nicht depressiv von der Musik her. Sie regen an, doch mal nach zu denken und trotzdem machen sie Lust auf mehr. In meinem Freundeskreis finden nicht alle die Ohrbooten gut. Es trifft also nicht jeden Geschmack. Meinen haben Sie getroffen! Viel Spaß mit der CD!"
1,"Man hätte echt mehr draus machen können. Leider hat Europa den Fehler gemacht und versucht, das aufgeblähte Buch so aufgebläht zu übernehmen, wodurch auch die Action-Szenen sehr lang erscheinen, was ich sehr schade finde. Gerade hier hätte man mit schnellen Szenen ein viel besseres Hörspiel aus der weniger tollen Vorlage machen können. Die Auflösung ist ein wenig abgeändert, was mich sehr stört, weil sie dadurch unlogisch erscheint. Und diese Unlogik hätte nicht sein müssen..."
1,"Ich darf alle 124 Folgen mein eigen nennen, ich persönlich bin ein grosser fan der drei ??? kenne somit wirklich alle folgen. Aber die Aktuelle folge ist meiner Empfindung nach wohl die schlechteste die ich je gehört habe. Ich Persönlich finde diese Folgen einfach nur Langweilig und unendlich lang gezogen für in keinsterweise Die drei ??? like!  liegt aber ja bekanntlich immer in der Sicht des Betrachters. Wenn diese folge nicht der Vollständigkeit in eurer Sammlung fehlt darf, könnt ihr euch das Geld getrost sparen. bleibt zu hoffen das Folge 125 erfolgreicher wird"
2,"Seit Folge 121 krank die Serie dahin. Auch hier wieder, brauchen die drei zu beginn 10min um eine Szene vor dem Hollywoodschriftzug abzuhandeln: Anschleichen, jemand fällt von einem der großen Buchstaben, Tatort untersuchen. Das ging auch mal in 5min. Und so schläft man dann auch ein, ohne das Ende mitzubekommen. Irgendeine Story wird von den drei in Dialogen so vor sich hergeschoben. Nicht der Szenenwechsel dominiert, sondern das reine Gespräch."
1,"Ein Zwerg, der sich dann als Affeentpuppt. Ein U-Boot das zum Schmuggeln dient. Lächerlich, albern und nichts Neues und ohne Unterhaltungswert Alles dreht sich um die Höhle, die das Boot zum Schmuggeln ansteuert. Angezogen werden die drei von dem Zwerg...äh...ja, Affen...."
1,"Der Film ist der absolute Megahammer und echt super, doch der Song dazu ist ein totaler Flop. Im Film wurden einige gute Songs angespielt, aber dieser ist gar nicht gut. Hätte mir echt einen besseren des Films gewünscht. Außerdem hätte das Cover auch noch schlecht gestaltet."
5,"Faun habe ich auf dem WGT 2005 live kennen- und lieben gelernt. Da stimmt einfach alles: die beiden Sängerinnen sind super aufeinander eingestimmt, auch die (manchmal vorhandene) männliche Gesangsstimme klingt toll. Die Melodien gehen ins Ohr und sind oftmals mit elektronischen Klängen untermalt- was hier aber keineswegs unpassend erscheint (wie bei manchen Anderen Versuchen, die beiden Stile zu vereinen), sondern ein harmonisches Zusammenspiel von fast hypnotischer Kraft schafft. Tolle Musik! Und diese CD ist viel besser, als die Erste. Kaufen, wenn man Mittelalter und Mystik mag!"
2,"Leider hatte ich der bestehenden Rezension vertraut. Aber leider ist diese Musik weder modern noch hat sie Power. Alle Stücke sind lediglich langweiliges Techno-/Trance-Zeugs, dass jedes billige Keyboard auf die Schnelle ausspuckt. Nervt einfach nut tierisch... Die Beats sind zum Trainineren zu gebnrauchen, deswegen immerhin 2 Sterne. Aber keine Kaufempfehlung. Mixt euch für den Preis lieber eine CD aus legalen MP3s zusammen."
5,"Die Ärzte gründeten sich im Jahre 1982 kurz nachdem sich Soilent Grün aufgelößt hatten und in der hatten ja Bela.B (Dirk Felsenheimer) und Farin Urlaub (Jan Vetter) schon zusammen gespielt und so beschloß man sich gemeinsam auf Musikalische großtaten vorzubereiten dazu kam noch der Bassist von der damaligen Band Frau Surbier Sahnie (hans Runge) der ja dann im Jahre 1986 rausgeschmissen wurde mit dem berühmtesten Satz den ich je in der Musikhistorie gehört habe (Ihr braucht mein gesicht). Doch nun mal ein paar wörter zu dieser CD hier!: Die Ärzte Früher 1982- 1983 sind songs die man heute alle als klassiker betiteln darf denn irgendein song auf dieser cd ist auf jedem Ärzte Konzert schon pflicht, allein der geniale Sommerhit ""Sommer,Palmen,Sonnenschein"" denn man immer wieder hören kann und nich müde von wird oder das schönste lied auf der platte und der auch mal wieder beweisst Live sind die Ärzte einfach besser als wie auf Platte (d.Red) ""Teenager Liebe"" aber auch schon länger gespielte songs wie Vollmilch oder ""Eckelpack"" sind immer wieder geniale songs die man auch immer widder gerne hört. Vielleicht ist die Soundqualität nicht der bringer aber dafür sind die songs umso kultiger denn vielleicht sind die songs heute um einiges besser durchdacht und musikalisch meilenweit besser als diese lieder hier doch dafür haben diese lieder hier ein ganz besonderen flair den neueren songs vielleicht ein wenig feheln halt richtige evergreens schon fast.Also als ärzte Fan der ersten Stunde oder wer die jungs in den 80er mal beundern möchte einfach hier zugreifen da kann man nix falsch machen und dem kann gesagt sein das er sein geld in die richtige cd der ärzte investiert oder ich könnte noch zu ""Das ist nicht die ganze wahrhit"" platte raten diese ist ebenfalls absolute klasse."
2,"Mit System scheint Seal bei seiner neuesten Platte nicht unbedingt heran gegangen zu sein. Seine neueste Scheibe mit Namen ""System"" wurde ja als das Highlight des Pop-Jahres 2007 verkauft und wenn schon Seal drauf steht, hofft man natürlich auch dementsprechend auf Qualität. Tja, wie soll ich es am besten ausdrücken? Nein. ""System"" ist leider nicht mehr als belangloser Durchschnitts-Pop, der einfach überhaupt nicht überzeugen kann. Der Opener ""If it's in my mind, it's in my face"" stellt dabei noch fast den stärksten Song der Platte dar, obwohl man auch hier schon die Anzeichen der schwachen Produktion zu spüren bekommt. Trotzdem ist der Eröffnungs-Titel ein wirklich starker Pop-Song geworden, dem Seal mit seiner samtigen Stimme noch die fehlende Krönung gibt. Doch dann fängt der Qualitätsverfall meiner Meinung nach schon langsam an. Die Single ""Amazing"" ist noch halbwegs hörbar, da der Ohrwurm-Charakter noch ein wenig hoch gehalten wird, doch schon wieder fällt mir die störende Produktion auf, die aus ""System"" kein wirklich gutes Album macht. Anscheinend waren auch hier die Produzenten zu Gange, die schon das musikalisch an sich nicht schlechte ""Confessions on a dance floor"" von Madonna produzierten, doch trotzdem kann ich mich mit diesem 08/15-Techno-Sound irgendwie nicht ganz anfreunden! ""Just like before"" und das anschließende ""Loaded"" sind nicht mehr als durchschnittliche Popper, von denen Seal bis dato noch nicht wirklich viele veröffentlicht hat. Das gleichermaßen unnötige wie vorhersehbare Duett mit seiner Ehefrau Heidi Klum stellt dann aber eindeutig den bisherigen Tiefpunkt von ""System"" dar. Einfallsloser Text trifft auf langweilige Melodie und Klum's untalentierten Gesang. ""Wedding day"" war zwar abzusehen, hätte man aber einfach nur weg lassen sollen!!! Erst fünf Tracks gehört und schon spürt man eine gewisse Unzufriedenheit in sich, die sich mit dem mickrigen Rest leider nicht mehr legen wird, denn die restlichen Songs muss man, bis auf den etwas besseren Titeltrack, einfach nicht gehört haben. Nachdem man sich ""Amazing"" ein zweites Mal in einer unnötigen Remix-Version anhört ist Seal's neuester Output auch schon wieder vorbei. Auf der einen Seite sind zehn neue Songs für ein Pop-Album viel zu wenig, doch in diesem Falle war ich irgendwie froh, dass da nicht noch mehr kam! Auch wenn es drastisch klingt: ""System"" ist für mich nicht mehr als unterdurchschnittlicher Pop, der durch die Techno-artige Produktion total verhunzt wurde. Das Seal's Soul-Stimme dabei viel zu kurz kommt muss dabei wohl gar nicht mehr erwähnt werden... Das Cover finde ich aber super..."
4,"Längst hat sich Gary Moore auch wieder den etwas härteren Tönen genähert und sich in die Weiten des Blues-Rock begeben, ohne deswegen wieder klassischen Hard-Rock zu spielen. Mit Dark Days in Paradise und spätestens mit Power of the Blues oder Scars erweiterte und öffnete er sein Blues-Spektrum, sein letztes Album Close as you get war durchaus eine Bereicherung.  Auch Bad for you baby lässt sich in die Reihe der Blues-Rock Alben stellen und bietet solide Unterhaltung auf hohem (Gitarren-)Niveau. Es knüpft schlüssig an Close as you get an. Moore zeigt (fast) die gesamte Bandbreite seines Könnens, ohne dass es langweilig wird.  Dennoch sind die Songauswahl und das Songwriting durchaus beschränkt, echte Überraschungen wird man hier nicht erleben. Außer vielleicht das Stück Preacher Man Blues (mit Otis Taylor) bewegt sich alles in den (nicht nur durch Moore) bekannten Schemata und Skalen. Trouble ain't far behind stellt einen schönen Abschluss dar und macht das Ganze zu einer runden Sache, bei der Freunde der Mooreschen Kunst auf ihre Kosten kommen. Dennoch möchte man dem Altmeister zurufen, dass er auf seine alten Tage durchaus wieder etwas mehr Mut zeigen könnte, insbesondere beim Songwriting."
1,"Ich mach es kurz. Das ""Zuhältertape"" und das ""Boss der Bosse"" Album sind das Beste was es im Deutschrap gibt. Von diesem Niveau ist ""Alphagene"" meilenweit entfernt. Musikalisch größtenteils nur noch 08/15. Absolut kein Vergleich zu so melodischen Tracks wie ""Nacht"", ""Rauch"", oder ""Boss der Bosse"". Raptechnisch sicher immer noch besser als jeder andere Deutschrapartist, aber leider lyrisch auch nicht mehr so hart wie früher.  Fazit:  Nur ein Stern, weil die Erwartungen so immens hoch waren und leider nicht annähernd erfüllt werden konnten. Wer Kollegah für seine alten Sachen feiert wird mit ""Alphagene"" nicht glücklich werden."
2,"Vier Jahreszeiten und Teufelstrillersonate sind Stücke, die dutzendfach aufgenommen sind. Was treibt Künstler, sich dem nochmals zu widmen ? Sie könnten sich sagen, muss ich veröffentlicht haben. Das wäre dann für sie eine Motivation, aber nicht für den Hörer. Ich habe etwas Neues zu sagen. Das wäre dann eine Motivation für den Hörer. Wie steht es damit ? Natürlich sind die Musiker hoch professionell. Aber macht dies für sich eine spannende Interpretation ? Wenn ich zB höre, wie sie das "" Gewitter"" spielen, den dritten Satz aus dem ""Sommer"", kann ich schreiben, so etwas kenne ich lange und besser. Selbst in dieser Art des konventionellen Zugangs gibt es dann mindestens gleichwertige , wenn nicht mitreissendere Interpretation, wie etwa die seines Kollegen  Kennedy. Schon der Beginn des Zyklus ist so konventionell, dass ich die Scheibe eigentlich sofort weglegen würde. Nach Harnoncourt und all denen, die ihm nachgefolgt sind, sollte man diese Werke nicht mehr so spielen. Bell behauptet zwar, dass  man viel Freiheit des Musizierens habe, aber hören kann ich dies nicht. Die Teufelstrillersonate fand in Oistrakh und Szeryng so überragende Interpreten, dass dagegen die meisten Geiger etwas blass aussehen,so auch Joshua Bell. Er hat nicht das Format, nicht die Ton-Intensität dieser grossen Künstler. Das dieser limierten Aufnahme ein Mini-Poster beiligt, lässt den Klssikfreund vielleicht schmunnzeln, vielleicht aber auch erstaunt fragen, ob man mit 41 Jahren noch in den Zimmer junger Mädchen präsent sein will? Früher hatte Bell einen solchen Glamour. Aber mit 41 ? Der Hörer hat davon keinen Gewinn. Auch hier gilt : die Musiker spielen nicht schlecht, aber die Aufnahme ist schlicht entbehrlich."
5,"J.J.Cale ausgesprochen und wunderbar feinfühlig, mit der herrlichen Christine Lakeland als loyale Partnerin, großartiges Songmaterial, keine Schwachstellen, very laidback und Entspannung pur, einfach ein zeitlos  grandioser Feelingsvermittler in unserer Hektomatik Welt. Zum Genießen und relaxen, Wohlfühlmusik ohne Ablaufdatum. Vielleicht ist ""die fünfte"" J.J. Cales beste überhaupt, auf jeden Fall aber ein beeindruckendes Meisterwerk eines bemerkenswerten Musikers, der leider nur im Verborgenen blüht, aber immer wieder Meilensteine in diesem Genre abliefert. Bitte bleibe uns noch lange erhalten !"
1,Ich glaub nicht wirklich. Aber die Plattenindustrie versucht wie jedes Jahr vor Weihnachten einfach aus ihren Musikrechten Kohle zu machen. Die Songs sind Klasse und haben die vollen Sterne verdient. Aber bereits 1977 kam mit dem Album Decade einen Werkschau heraus die bis auf 3 Songs alle anderen und noch viele mehr enthält. Warten wir auf die große Werkschau wie einer schon vor mir richtig schrieb.
1,"Weihnachten steht fast vor der Tür. Zeit der ""Best of""-Platten. Travis kommt mit einer nach nur 4 (!) Platten mit einer Sammlung ihrer Singles. Pulp bringt seine/ihre ""Hits"". Robbie war schon ein bißchen eher dabei."
4,"In seiner christlichen Periode hatte Dylan eine seiner Hoch-Zeiten. Shot of Love ist ein Meisterwerk unter Mitarbeit von Ron Wood und Ringo Starr. Die Aufnahme von 1981 zeigt, was schon vor 27 Jahren technisch möglich war. Dylan spielt (Every Grain of Sand) die inspirierteste Mundharmonika seit Hippiezeiten. Fein ziselierte, audiophile Aufnahme, die an die Standards von Chesky Records erinnert."
2,"Ich konnte es kaum erwarten, LeAnns neues Album Whatever We Wanna"" endlich in den Händen zu halten, vor allem weil ich ihren letzten Ausflug in die Popmusik noch im Ohr hatte: Twisted Angel"" - ein Album voller wunderschöner, vielschichtiger Songs, die sich angenehm von der heutzutage produzier-ten seelenlosen Massenware abhoben. Dementsprechend neugierig war ich auf Whatever We Wanna"". Doch schon nach dem ersten Hören war klar, dass LeAnn das Nivea des Vorgängers nicht einmal im Ansatz erreicht hat. Das Album ist vollgepackt mit anspruchslosen Tanznummern a la ,Atomic Kitten' - wobei nicht einmal die 2-3 Ohrwürmer mitgeliefert werden, die einem auch Jahre später noch an den Künstler erinnern lassen. Die meisten Lieder sind mit übertrieben hektischer Musik unterlegt, was die Nerven des Hörers über Gebühr strapaziert. Von LeAnns herzzerreißenden Bal-laden im Stil von How Do I Live"" oder You Light Up My Life"" fehlt jede Spur; stattdessen wird man mit halbherzig gesungenen Lovesongs abgespeist, die weder textlich noch stimmlich wirklich überzeugen. Wo bei ihrem Vorgän-geralbum aussagekräftige erzählerische Lieder wie Damn"", The Safest Place"", Wound Up"" und Review My Kisses"" zu finden waren, präsentiert LeAnn hier größtenteils 2. Wahl. Allein Everybody's Somebody"" stimmt mich versöhnlich, was nicht wenig an ihrem Duett-Partner, dem Ex-Westlife-Mitglied Brian McFadden liegt, der wohl versucht, LeAnn sanft zu ihrem früheren Stil zurückzubewegen. Von diesem Lied einmal abgesehen können sich höchstens noch Destructive"" (weil erfrischend anders) und Some People"" hören lassen. Aus This Life"", Break Me Down"" und ""And It Feels Like"" hätte man mehr ma-chen können, doch verglichen mit dem Rest der Songs muss man mit dem letzt-endlich mittelprächtigen Ergebnis zufrieden sein. Fazit Auch nach mehrmaligem Hören bleibt zu sagen: 3 von 15 Songs gefallen, weitere 3 sind erträglich. Alle anderen enttäu-schen so, dass nicht einmal mehr LeAnns bekanntermaßen außergewöhnliche Stimme dieses Album davor bewahren kann, in den Abgrund banaler seelenloser Popmusik abzutrudeln, die man nicht einmal als Berieselung im Supermarkt ertragen könnte, da sie viel zu hektisch und entnervend klingt. LeAnn, das kannst du besser!"
1,"blenden lassen ! rückenwind war cool und ich fand dieses stück viel besser, wie einiges von den fantas vorher. für ein komplettes album war das aber viel zu wenig ! wenn doch wenigstens noch das stück liebesbrief mit drauf gewesen wäre ! ( klasse dreh auf lanzarote !!!!! ) so reicht das ganze leider nur für einen stern. einen versuch war es wert, doch der ist gescheitert."
2,"Was macht sie aus, die genialen Soundtracks von Quentin Tarantino? Es ist doch die Tatsache, dass man beim Hören seiner Lieder sofort die dazugehörigen Film-Szenen vor Augen hat.  In dieser Hinsicht ist Tarantino ein Genie, das seines gleichen sucht. Man denke nur an ""You Never Can Tell"", zu Travoltas Tanzeinlage in Pulp Fiction oder an ""Stuck In The Middle With You"" aus Reservoir Dogs. Genau hier liegt mein Problem: Ich habe Death Proof nocht nicht gesehen und mir fehlt jeglicher Bezug zum Film. Es ist gut möglich, ja sogar sehr wahrscheinlich, dass ich in zwei Wochen, nachdem ich Death Proof gesehen habe diese Rezension nach oben korrigieren muss. Aber bis dahin kann ich (leider) nur 2 Sterne vergeben. Mein Tipp: Seht euch bitte zuerst den Film an !!!"
1,"Ich kann vom kauf dieser Cd nur abraten. Die Soundqualität auf dieser CD ist schlechter, als die auf meiner uralten orginalen VHS-Kassette, die schon x-male abgespielt wurde!  Ich persönlich bereue den kauf dieser CD und hatte mir ehrlich mehr davon versprochen!"
5,John Barry - spätestens seit James Bond ein wichtiger Name in Sachen Filmmusik. Hier finden sich einige seiner besten Kompositionen vereint.
5,"Die Keinohrhasen-Eierwärmer sind wirklich sehr gut verarbeitet (innen gefüttert!) und sind genauso süß, wie ihr großer Bruder, flauschig und knuffig. Und wenn sie gerade kein Frühstücksei zu wärmen haben, kann man auch ganz prima mit ihnen kuscheln ;-)"
5,"Mit ""Cradlesong"" liefert Rob Thomas das Album ab, welches ich mir bereits 2005 bei Erscheinen seines Solo-Debuts erhofft hatte. ""...Something to be"" war und ist natürlich kein schlechtes Album, wahrlich nicht. Aber es hat die ein oder andere Länge. 4 oder 5 der 12 Songs auf ""...Something to be"" haben einfach nicht die Klasse der restlichen Songs. Ganz anders jetzt das Zweitwerk ""Cradlesong"". Das Album ist von vorn bis hinten mit einer durchgängigen Qualität gesegnet, die der Vorgänger nicht hatte. Darüber hinaus steckt in ""Cradlesong"" mehr Matchbox Twenty als im Vorgänger. Anspieltips möchte ich eigentlich nicht geben, weil das Album als Ganzes ein gelungenes Stück Musik ist. Aber da ich dann nach mehrmaligem Hören doch mein Lieblingsstück gefunden habe, möchte ich jedem wärmstens den großartigen Song ""Snowblind"" ans Herz legen. Großer Sport, Mister Thomas! Unterm Strich wohlverdiente 5 von 5. Und als nächstes bitte wieder ein MB20-Album plus Tournee!"
2,"Ich bin durch Zufall auf Breakin Benjamin gekommen und hörte mir auf einer anderen CD des Sängers einige Lieder an. Ich war fasziniert von dieser einzigartigen Stimme, diesen tollen Gitarreneinlagen und den schönen Songtexten. Wenig später überlegte ich: Kauf dir doch noch eine weitere CD von Breakin Benjamin! Tja, leider habe ich mir dann diese hier gekauft, auf der mir persönlich nur 2 Lieder wirklich gefallen. Der Rest ist einfach nur langweilig und heruntergeleiert. Die Stimme des Sängers ist zwar weiterhin wunderschön, aber das wars schon wieder. Sie ist viel zu schade für diese öden Lieder. Wer Phobia kennt und liebt, wird diese CD hier nicht mögen. Kein Kauftipp von mir."
5,"Die Gleichung E=MC² begründet eigentlich die Relativitätstheorie von Einstein, darf sogleich aber auch gern das 11. Studioalbum von Mariah Carey betiteln. Dachten wir doch nach dem Vorgänger ""The Emancipation of Mimi"", dass die Emanzipation ihres Alter Egos Mimi längst abgeschlossen sei, werden wir nun mit der Emanzipation der Mariah Carey konfrontiert und lauschen mit hohen Erwartungen dem offiziellen Nachfolger. Starten wir also mit ""Migrate"", das mit witzigen Synthie-Flöten und einer starken R'n'B-Attitüde garantiert für einige Zeit im Ohr hängen bleibt. Unterstützung in Höchstform erhält sie hierbei von T-Pain. Gleich darauf folgt die erste Single ""Touch my body"", die ebenfalls mit einer verspielten R'n'B-Melodie trumpft und zudem Ihre 18. #1 in den Billboard-Charts markiert. Im mittleren Teil plätschern Songs wie das reggaelastige ""Cruise Control"", das pathetische ""Love Story"" oder das balladeske ""Last Kiss"" leider etwas vor sich hin. Die spaßig, funkigen Nummern werden mit ""I'm that chick"" (mit Unterstützung eines Michael Jackson-Samples), ""I'll be loving you long time"" und dem groovigen ""O.O.C."" abgedeckt. Gegen Ende werden dann noch mal die ganz großen Geschütze aufgefahren. ""For the record"" ist ein grandioser Herzschmerz-Song in bewährter Mariah-Manier. Raffiniert und mit tollen Bridges singt Mariah eine großartige Ballade, in der sie emotional so explodiert, wie man es lang nicht mehr in dieser Form von ihr gehört hat. Auf der zweiten US-Single ""Bye bye"" wird nachdenklich und traurig an die verlorenen Freunde und Familienmitglieder erinnert. Das bombastische ""I wish you well"" ist ein stimmliches Meisterwerk und zieht als finaler Song noch einmal alle Register. Zwar hat Mariah Carey diverse Co-Writer, doch sollte nicht vergessen werden, dass sie selbst auch ausgezeichnete Lyrics schreibt. So gehört beim cleveren ""Side effects"", eine Abrechnung mit Ex-Gatte Tommy Mottola, bei der fabelhaften Ballade ""Stay in love"" oder eben auch bei ""Touch my body"". Alles in allem macht E=MC² Lust auf unzählige Runden im Player. Ein gut produzierter Nachfolger mit herrlicher Musik wurde wieder einmal mehr von einer der großartigsten Sängerinnen aller Zeiten abgeliefert. Übrigens die Deluxe-Edt. braucht man nicht wirklich. Es gibt kein digitales Zusatzmaterial, lediglich aber eine lästige CD-Pappverpackung, ein Poster und ein I-Pod-Skin zum aufkleben."
5,"So lange haben wir gewartet, zum Schluß schon die Wochen, Tage und Stunden gezählt, nun ist sie endlich da: ""ATLS"", wie sie die eingefleischten Fans bereits liebevoll nennen. Mit ""Back to Bedlam"" hatte James die Meßlatte ziemlich hoch gelegt und alle haben sich gefragt: Ist da eine Steigerung möglich? Klare Antwort: Jaaaaa!! Schon beim ersten Durchhören der neuen Songs war ich von allen restlos begeistert. Nichts Nerviges, nichts Langweiliges oder Eintöniges. Und wenn die 10 Lieder durchgelaufen sind, wieder wie schon bei B2B die erstaunte Frage: Nanu, schon alles???? Wir wollen mehr!!! :-D"
1,"England will den 3. Weltkrieg - zumindest musikalisch! Wie sonst läßt sich erklären, das man für Blunt überhaupt Rohstoffe zum CD pressen bereit stellt. Um es auf den Punkt zu bringen: ja, James Blunt mach den ""Same Mistake"". Dauerwiederholung eines minderbemittelten Refrains, untermalt mit einem Jaulen, das selbst Hunde unter die Couch treibt. Aber - wenn ein Hund zu jaulen beginnt, stimmen andere mit ein. - Ich nicht!!!"
1,"Das dachte ich schon als ich die Single Different Places gehört hatte, denn das ist für mich in keinster Wiese ein Ohrwurm oder ""Hit"". Aber das Album ist ja die Spitze der Gleichförmigkeit und Massenkompabilität. Was soll denn da bitteschön Roots Reggae sein? Da geht nix in die Beine oder lässt einen mit dem Kopf mitwippen... Und was nützt es wie ""toll"" dieses Album produziert ist, wie perfekt oder modern. Was interessiert was er sich für Gedanken gemacht hat, die Musik ist es die berühren muss und nicht das Gefasel hier in der dreiseitigen Beschreibung. Ein PR-Text durch und durch. Ich bin mir sicher das sich Gentleman viele Gedanken über alle seine Songs macht, aber es ist unnötig dies hier zu sagen, das tun seine Textev von alleine... Und dieses spirituelle Gelaber geht einem ja richtig auf die Nerven, hat das hier niemand gelesen? Er wettert gegen jede Form von Dogmen...aber wenn ich diesen Text lese hört er sich selber an als sei er direkt aus der (Kauf-Mich) Bibel! Nunja aber zurück zur Musik: Vielleicht geht das Album ja nach mehrmaligem hören in die Ohren, aber ich bin mir sicher das es niemals an seine vorherigen Alben herankommen wird. Es ist so geschmacklos wie Tomaten aus Holland: Jede einzelne makellos, jede perfekt produziert, aber ihnen fehlt das natürliche Aroma! Schade Herr Tillmann..."
2,"Ich empfehle eher, sich die einzelnen Pink-Floyd-Alben zu kaufen, die man mag. Diese Zusammenstellung von Titeln ist meiner Meinung nach nicht gut gelungen. Zum Beispiel feht bei Comfortably Numb ein Teil vom Gitarrensolo. Einfach mittendrin ausgeblendet. Da waren wahre Kunstbanausen am Werk!"
5,"Mit CONTINUUM liefert J. Mayer eine reife Leistung ab, zumal für einen 30 Jährigen ! Sehr kreative und  melodische Miusik, die oft mit musikalischen Besonderheiten überrascht. Anspieltipps:  I Dont Trust MYSELF BELIEF (Hervorragend!)  STOP THIS TRAIN   Man merkt, daß der Mann seit seiner ersten CD, die auch schon gut war, eine musikalische  Weiter-Entwicklung vollzogen hat und ihm immer noch Überraschendes einfällt.  Keinerlei Einheitsbrei,authentische und eigenwilige Popmusik !  Der amerikanische Sting (m.E. kommt Mayer durchaus an Sting ran!)"
2,"Kennste eins, kennste alle. Permanent gleicher Rhythmus ohne nennenswerte Variation. Alle Lieder klingen wie ""Du hast mich tausendmal..."" Grundsätzlich gibt es nur 1 Thema: Frustrierte Frau nach One-Night-Stand. Der Mann, das betrügende, verlogene Element. Sie weint völlig naiv und hilflos einer Kurzbeziehung nach. Habe diese CD gehört und würde sie nicht kaufen! Da gewinnt man den Eindruck, Andrea Berg wolle sich mit allen Mitteln wieder an den Schlagerhimmel hinaufkatapultieren nach dem Motto: Was einmal lief, wird doch wohl auch nochmal laufen. So nicht!"
2,"Ich bin von dem Album weniger begeistert als die Meisten hier. Als ich vor Jahren Andrea Berg das erste Mal hörte, war ich echt hin und weg. Ein furioser Erfolg folgte. Leider erkenne ich auch in diesem Album wiederum nur Stagnation oder kurzum keine Weiterentwicklung, nichts Neues, kein Aha Effekt, dass unser aller Andrea auch was anderes kann. Die Melodien sind identisch oder sogar gleich zu dem was da schon war. Ich schließe mich denen an, die Meinen, Sie sollte mal den Produzenten wechseln, was riskieren, denn so wird es sicher auch nicht mehr allzu lange gut gehen.  Wem's gefällt -&gt; mir nach dieser Scheibe erstmal nicht mehr. Aber für das erreichte ein Zusatzsternchen. Nur was für Hardcore-Fans von Andrea Berg, die es mögen wenn sich ein Titel wie der nächste anhört."
2,"Eine ganz gewöhnliche Durchschnittsstimme von einer Sängerin, die halt sehr gut aussieht. Offenbar reicht das heute!"
5,"Ach ja, da werden Erinnerungen wach... Ich hatte diese Platte mal auf Casette und habe sie mir rauf und runter angehört, besonders ""die Maurer"" und ""Glaspalast"". Einfach gigantisch!! Das war meine Zeit! Werde mir jetzt die CD bestellen und weiterschwelgen! Sehr empfehlenswert!!!"
5,"Keine Frage, dieses Album ist ein Klassiker und verdient die Höchstwertung, ebenso wie die zweite Platte von Ideal. Beide Scheiben sind seit einiger Zeit auf CD erhältlich, nunmehr sogar digital remastert und mit Bonus-Tracks versehen. Wer da nicht zugreift, ist selber schuld.  Unverständlich bleibt mir, weshalb die Ideal-Alben ""Bi Nuu"" und ""Zugabe"" bis heute nicht auf CD wieder aufgelegt wurden. Zweifellos gibt es eine Menge Leute, die auf diese Veröffentlichungen warten. Weshalb also zögert das verantwortliche Label, einen Re-Release zu lancieren?"
5,"Ich habe alle Alben von ENIGMA und kann hier einige Rezesionen zu dieser CD nicht so recht verstehen. Gut, sie ist anders, aber nicht schlechter. Eher was für Intrumentalfans. Wer chillige, spacige Musik mag, ist hier absolut richtig. Genial zum Entspannen und zum Arbeiten - 5 Sterne von mir, sehr empfehlenswert!"
5,"Also auch ich bin mit dieser Musik zu Weihnachten aufgewachsen. Zufällig ist mir diese Musik jetzt wieder in den Sinn gekommen. Freu mich schon, wenn die CD kommt. Als Kind lief die,damals noch, Schallplatte zu Weihnachten hoch und runter. Und als ich jetzt diese Lieder gerade wieder angespielt habe, kamen sofort diese schönen Erinnerungen aus der Kindheit wieder. Mein absolutes Lieblingslied, damals wie heute, ist immer noch ""Hey du Weihnachtsmann"". Einfach nur süß..."
5,"...and you got yours. so eröffnet Arnim im Song ""Demons Galore"" dem Namensgeber dieser EP,eine punkige Nummer vom Album Limbo Messiah. Aber kaufenswert macht diese EP nicht dieser sondern die anderen Tracks: Verdammt gut gelungen ist nämlich z.B. die Coverversion des bekannten Beastie Boys-Klassikers ""Sabotage"" vom Open Air in St. Gallen. Desweiteren findet sich hier eine von Thomas gesungenen Version von ""Marmelade und Himbeereis"", die mit sanftem Klavier beginnt um dann doch noch ""verrockt"" zu werden.Besonders treffend auch der Beitrag von Dendemann in der Kollaboration mit den Schnitzeln namens ""Wer A sagt muss auch B zahlen"", mit amüsantem Text und schon nach vorne gehender Gitarren. Auch hervorzuheben ist das Joy Division-Cover ""She's lost control"" von Bernd Kurtzke eingesungen, sehr stimmig auch das. Eher nicht nach meinem Geschmack ist aber ""Kaputtt"" eine ziemlich stranger ""Elektroremix"" des ebenfalls auf Limbo Messiah enthaltenen ""Sharp, Cool &amp; Collected"", ich gebe der EP trotzdem volle Punktzahl. Verzeiht mir dass ich schaue bei dieser Band durch die rosa Brille, da mir bisher ziemlich alles von dieser im deutschprachigen Raum einzigartigen Band ausserordentlich gut gefallen hat.  Und ich möchte hiermit abschließend allen, die (noch) nie  ein Konzert dieser 5 Berliner gesehen haben, dringend raten, dies nachzuholen. Ich kann nur bestätigen, dass diese Band nicht umsonst den Ruf der besten deutschen Liveband besitzt..."
2,"Hallo, auch wenn ich bei den Fans in Ungnade falle, aber HUMBUG ist ""humbug"". Die Scheibe ist kein würdiger Nachfolger zu FAVOURITE WORST NIGHTMARE oder dem Erstling WHATEVER PEOPLE... Sorry, aber von lahmen oder gar keinen Melodien, Songs ohne Drive und streckenweise sogar langweiligen Arrangements kann man nicht behaupten, dass sie sich zu einem gelungenen und in sich stimmigen Album geformt haben. Schade, ich hatte mich so darauf gefreut - schließlich sind die beiden ersten Scheiben 1a Spitzenklasse. Zwei Sterne für ""crying lightning"", ""dance little liar"" und das Artwork. Fazit - auf das nächste Album warten und zwischenzeitlich THE LAST SHADOW PUPPETS probieren, die sind nicht schlecht."
4,"Obwohl er sie eigentlich nicht so richtig gewollt hat, ist sie nun doch Teil seiner Discographie geworden: Sein erstes und für lange wohl einzigstes ""best of""-Album in CD-Format. Und sie ist nicht so  schlecht, wie er sie selber macht. Vielleicht noch ein wenig zu viele  Versionen seiner einprägsamsten Lieder, aber ohne Ihnen durch melodische  Veränderungen etwas neues zu geben. Vielleicht auch bleibt die Auswahl zu  gering für 19 Jahre Geschichte auf der Bühne der Liedermacher, aber für all  das wird man entschädigt durch unnachahmliche Live-Versionen sowie dem  immer wieder schönen Song ""Regen in Berlin"". Auf die nächsten 19  Heinz-Rudolf!"
5,"Tolle Künstler singen die bekanntesten Lieder von Udo Jürgens. Ich geb zu: ich war anfangs skeptisch, habe nun aber so richtig Lust, ins Musical zu gehen und es mir anzusehen. Ich kann die CD sehr empfehlen (und ich bin kein Udo Jürgens-Fan)."
2,"Als jahrzehntelanger Udo-Jürgens-Fan freut es mich natürlich besonders, wenn auch ältere Platten auf CD escheinen. Was jedoch diese CD betrifft, bin ich schon enttäuscht - nicht wegen des Inhaltes, der ist ja bestens bekannt- sondern wegen der schlechten Soundqualität. Hier hätte man mehr daraus machen können und müsssen! Da klingt ja meine alte Vinylplatte noch besser. Schade darum."
1,"Bravo Hits stand für mich immer für aktuelle Chart &amp; Radiomusik - von diesem Sampler kannte ich rein vom Lesen her gerade mal 4-5 Titel, weitere 4 Titel erschlossen sich mir beim reinhören - aber was ist das für eine Bilanz bei 42 Titeln? Sorry, aber bei dieser Titelzusammenstellung ist man wohl besser beraten die einzelnen Titel die man wirklich hören will als mp3 zu kaufen und sich seine eigene CD zusammenstellen, denn unter dem Strich bekommt man dann bestimmt mehr für sein Geld!"
2,"Keine Ahnung,warum hier so viele Leute das Album in den Himmel loben. Die Platte wird sogar im Clan selbst lauthals kritisiert, allen voran von Rae&amp;Ghost . Der erste Track""Campfire"" geht richtig gut ab.Guter Beat und die Rapverse,besonders von Ghostface,sind sehr gelungen:Der Beste Joint vom Album,aber gleich beim nächsten Song fragt man sich,wann der Beat endlich losgeht.Die Drums plattern irgendwo im Hintergrund herum und dazu noch langweilige Raps.Gleiches gilt für""Get them out ya way pa"".Zum Glück kommen mit""Rushing Elephants""und""Unpredictable"" zwei annehmbare Nummern,allerdings nervt die Hook vom zweit genanten doch sehr. In nächsten Song wird bei den Beatles gesamplet,dass Dhani Harrison in den Song als Gast auftitt,war wohl eher wegen des Sample Clearings"".Langeweile ist das Wort was""Wolves""oder den Beat von""Gun will Go""ganz gut beschreibt.Mit Sunlight"" folgt der absolute Tiefpunkt:Was hat sich RZA bei diesen Solosong gedacht.Rap-wie Beattechnisch unterste Schublade,aber erst diese Texte,die wirken so, als wäre RZA auf einen LSD Trip gewesen. Bei""Stick me for my riches""und""Strapter"" kommen mit Gearald Alston,Sunny Valetine und Tash  Gäste, auf die man auch verzichten hätte können. Wenigstens erledigt GZA hier einen guten Job.""Weak Spot""und""Tar Pit"" glänzen durch  wirre, aber geile Beats.""Life Changes""ist pure langeweile.1993 aufgenommen ist der Freestyle""16th Chamber""mit Meth&amp;ODB.Die meisten der Reime kennt man schon,wenn man die Alben hat,die in der Zeitspanne 1993-1997 veröffentlicht wurden. RIP ODB Wirklich schade,dass man nach sechs Jahren Wartezeit so ein Album zufassen bekommt.Es wirkt so,dass die einzelnen Clanmitglieder sich lieber um die Solokarriere kümmern,als um den Clan.Bestimmt sind sie kurz mal ins Studio gegangen,haben in 15 Minuten ein Text geschrieben,schnell aufgenommen und sind wieder nach Hause gegangen ohne mit den anderen Mitgliedern zukommunizieren oder gar RZA eigene Ideen  vorzuschlagen und  Verbesserungswünsche zu äußern.So nach den Motto""RZA,du machst das schon"" Lieber folgende Alben kaufen: Entert he Wu-Tang Liquid Sword Only built 4 cuban links Tical Ironman"
5,"Shady Time Invasion ist ein ziemlich gutes Album, es enthält Freestyles und Remix-Titel von Eminem und einem bekannten DJ aus Detroit. Fazit: Für einen echten Eminem Fan durchaus weiterzuempfehlen"
1,"Auch wenn die CD noch nicht auf dem Markt zu kaufen ist, ich kenne und habe ALLE Lieder dieser CD. Deshalb kann ich sagen das die CD nicht wirklich ""schlecht"" ist, jedoch viele Titel der CD recht alt sind. Außerdem stellt mich die Mischung der Titel nicht zufrieden. Es ist mehr der Gangsterrap (ok paßt schon zum Film), jedoch Kunden die sich in diesem Genre nicht so auskennen und eingängige Sachen aller Alicia Keys, P. Diddy oder Usher suchen, werden hier nicht bedient. Desweiteren ist ja nicht einmal ""Loose Yourself"" von ""Eminem"" enthalten, dessen Lied zu Film ja eigentlich der Aufhänger ist."
5,"...cause Shady f***ing kill you ! So beginnt Eminem, ein Jahr nach seinem gigantischen Debüt,seinen Nachfolger. Und dieser ist, um es mit einem Wort zu sagen, genial. Sei es nun der psychphatische Fan, der alles für sein Idol aufgibt (""Stan""), die Nirvana-artig Kampfansage an seine kritiker (""The Way I am""), der tägliche Rundgang eines Geistesgestörten durch seine Umwelt (""The real slim shady"", ""I'm back"") oder aber der erste Teil einer Mordgeschichte, welche bereits auf seinem Debüt vollzogen wurde (""Kim""): Eminem's zweite Platte ist noch düsterer als die erste. Und sie macht unmissverständlich klar, dass Eminem sich nicht angepasst hat, sondern immernoch ein Original ist, das seinen Weg geht. So klingt diese CD, wie schon seine erste, ebenfals, wie direkt aus dem Trailer - Park. Ja, hier wird sogar dieser Eindruck noch verstärkt durch Bilder aus Eminem's Vergangenheit und das Cover, für welches er sich vor seinem alten Elternhaus ablichten lies. Ein Ort, indem Eminem einige der schwersten Zeiten seines Lebens verbrachte. Ein mehr als würdiger Nachfolger ! Und meine absolute Lieblingsplatte von Em bis heute ! Anspieltips: 1. Kim 2.

2,"Erstmal zum Anfang: Ich bin seit Jahren ein Aggro fan, aber was einem auf dieser Platte geboten wird, ist nicht mehr aggro würdig. Die einzigen, die diese Platte ganz gering hörbar machen, sind die Parts von Sido, B-Tight incl. den Features Harris und Shizoe. G-Hot schwankt, auf Tracks wie Benzin und Wahlkampf, einem der besten Tracks, ist er durchaus anzuhören. Was dagegen Tony D bei Aggro Berlin verloren hat, habe ich bis heute noch nicht verstanden, er zog auch schon die zweifellos potentiell gute Platte ""Heise Ware"" in den Dreck, und dann schreit er auch noch in vielen Tracks mit. Ich hoffe, Aggro Berlin machen bei ihrer Ansage Nr.6 nicht wieder die selben Fehler wie auf Nr.5, und lassen Sido und B-Tight mal wieder ein paar Takte mehr singen."
2,"Sie haben es ja schon angekündigt, dass der Sound sich gewandelt hätte, aber so deutlich hätte ich es nicht erwartet. Vom melodiösen Powermetal von einst ist nicht viel geblieben. Außer dem Song ""Flag The Ground"" erinnert kaum noch etwas an das Sonata Arctica wie ich es kannte. Die Balladen sind nicht schlecht aber in der Summe ist mir das Album vom Sound her zu wenig Sonata Arctica.  Nachdem ich das Album Probe gehört habe, bin ich mir nicht sicher, ob ich es kaufen werde. Die Songs sind wenig eingängig und auch der Gesang hat sich teilweise in eine Richtung entwickelt, die mir nicht gefällt."
5,"Missy Elliott ist seit jeher ein Phänomen. Sie ist seit langem eine der Künstlerinnen, die aus der hart umkämpften Hip Hop und R&amp;B Branche hervorsticht. Ihr eigenwilliger Sound, ihre besondere Mischung der Songs in ihren Alben, die sowohl von Party Hits bis hin zu romantischen Popsongs geht, macht das besondere an Missy Misdemeanor Elliott aus. Und auch in diesem Album, auch wieder produziert von Timberland, kommt diese Besonderheit von Missy wunderbar zur Geltung. Das Album ist gespickt von Hits, die alle ins Ohr gehen. Hervorzuheben ist keiner, weil jeder Song seine besonderen Merkmale hat, sodass sich kein Song anhört wie der Andere. Unterstützt von berühmten Künstlern wie Jay-Z, Nelly, Mary J. Blige, R. Kelly, Elephant Man oder Monica &amp; Beenie Man ist dieses Album zu einem weiterem Meisterwerk geworden. Kein Lied ist enttäuschend und das Album macht auch beim wiederholten Anhören immer noch Spaß. Die Alben, die sie vor ""This is not a Test"" herraus gebracht hat sind zwar auch sehr empfehlenswert, aber dieses Album übertrifft die Vorherigen bei weitem. Noch besser kommt dieses Besondere, was Missy so einzigartig macht zur Geltung. Es ist eine absolute Kaufempfehlung für all die, die entweder schon Missy Elliott Fans sind oder die nach einer besonderen CD im großen Wald der Hip Hop und R&amp;B Branche suchen."
1,"Ihr Debüt super! Die darauf folgende Live CD sensationell!  Aber was danach kam war meist eine musikalische Zumutung die sie mit ihrem neuen Album nochmals um längen überbieten konnte, und zwar leider nur an Schlechtigkeit! Ok man muss sagen die letzten paar Tracks sind hörbar ab Honey der Rest totaler Schrott! Schade!!!!!"
2,"»Zac« ist ja allgemein dafür bekannt schönen und ruhigen Gesang mit entsprechenden Lyrics auch mal mit flotteren Beats zu kombinieren. Ähnlich verhält es sich natürlich auch bei diesem Album, was gleich mit einem sehr gelungenen ersten Titel daherkommt, dann allerdings schon beim 2. Track völlig abdriftet. Er scheint sich in den Beats anscheinend oftmals komplett vergriffen zu haben. Mehrere Lieder wirken einfach komplett überproduziert, als ob man alle Instrumente die gerade im Studio herumlagen genommen und zusammen auf ein Stück gepackt hätte. Damit nicht genug gibts auf den Tonspuren die noch übrig waren nervöse Beats, einen jaulenden Musiq, einen singenden Musiq und ab und zu einen sprechenden Musiq hinterlegt mit einem Chor oder sonstigem Gesang. Kurz gesagt: Es passiert einfach viel zu viel. Besonders schrecklich in diesem Zusammenhang: »until« und »moneyright«. Es gibt zwar ruhigere Lieder die einem ein wenig dabei helfen den Kopf wieder etwas zu beruhigen, allerdings sind diese nicht besonders aussagekräftig, da man alles irgendwie einem Brei unterordnen kann. Allerdings finde ich auch, dass Musiq auf diesem Album zeigt dass er durchaus singen kann  rein Stimmtechnisch finde ich das eines seiner besten Werke  als Maßstab dienen natürlich nur seine Alben. Alles in Allem ist es aber ein relativ unnötiges Album bei dem es leider nichts wirklich neues von Musiq gibt..."
4,"Der DMX-Kenner bekommt die gewohnte Ruff Ryders Kost. Harte Bässe, DMX' krasse Stimme und guter Flow . Textlich spielt sich mal wieder alles zwischen harten Straßenkämpfern, weiblichen Rundungen und einem fast konterkarikierendem Gottesglauben ab. Aber das findet man mittlerweile auf so ziemlich jedem Hip-Hop-Album, ganz gleich welcher Gott gemeint ist. Die CD kann ich trotzdem bedenkenlos jedem Genre-Fan empfehlen. Sie ist recht abwechslungsreich und DMX schafft es immer wieder nicht zu kommerziell zu werden und sich die so wichtige Realness zu bewahren. Nicht die beste DMX aber immer noch besser als vieles andere!"
5,"Bis auf den Song ""the omen"" sind alle Tracks gut glungen. Ich weiß nich was ich hier noch hin schreiben soll. DMX IS GUT."
4,"ASD?! Häh, was geht? Afrob und Samy sind Garanten für ehrliche Texte und gute Beatz. Aber wer hätte das gedacht, dass die 2 mal zusammen ne Scheibe aufnehmen?! Das Album hat echt gelungene Tracks, manche werden so richtig gut je öfters man sie hört. Soetwas zeichnet ein gutes Album aus! Natürlich gibt es bei insgesamt 20 Tracks auch mal den einen oder anderen Track der etwas weaker ist, deshalb auch keine 5 Sterne. Ich vergebe 4,5 Sterne für das Album denn das hat es echt verdient!"
2,"einer der grössten leute im rap-biz überhaupt. ein wegbereiter, ein genie, ein... ich habe seine alben rauf und runter gehört bis zum erbrechen und man kann sie heute noch hören. das album ""raw footage"" wird bei mir aber wahrscheinlich nur ein paar wochen durchhalten. meiner meinung nach bis auf 2 ausnahmen alles tracks, die man schnell wieder vergessen wird. ich denke, er hat mit den falschen produzenten gearbeitet. ich träume von einem cube album komplett von dre produziert, das ding wär ne bombe!!!"
2,"...nennt man - glaube ich - Leute, die versuchen, auf der Woge des Erfolgs mitzuschwimmen, obwohl sie keine große Eigenleistung gebracht haben. So einen Fall haben wir ganz offensichtlich auch mit einem früherendem ehemaligen Rosenstolz-Produzenten vorliegen, der seinerzeit das zweite und dritte Studioalbum der Gruppe produzierte (""Nur einmal noch"" und ""Mittwoch is' er fällig"") sowie einen Sampler mit ""Raritäten"". Alle drei Platten erschienen damals Anfang/Mitte der 90er (als Rosenstolz noch relativ unbekannt war) bei Traumton und nicht bei der heutigen Rosenstolz-Plattenfirma Polydor (die später übrigens die Rechte für das allererste Studioalbum ""Soubrette werd' ich nie"" nachträglich erwarb). Daher liegen die Rechte nicht bei Rosenstolz selbst und dieser ehemalige Produzent schlachtet die Scheiben jetzt, da Rosenstolz seit einigen Jahren sehr erfolgreich ist, intensivst aus: Zunächst erschienen in diesem Zusammenhang die technisch aufgemotzten Kompilationen ""Kuss der Diebe"", ""Erwarten se nix"" und ""Wenn du aufwachst"" und nun also ""Mondkuss"". Wie gesagt, es wird kein neues Material geboten; alle schon einmal gehört. Rosenstolz hat die erwähnten vier CD's nicht authorisiert! Nur absolut eingefleischte Fans sollten daher diese Doppel-CD kaufen; sie können dem Sammelsurium vielleicht noch Neues abgewinnen. Allen anderen rate ich, sich zunächst über den hervorragenden Sampler ""Alles Gute Gold"" anzunähern und dann sukzessive alle regulären Rosenstolz-Studioalben zu kaufen. Da erhält man einen wesentlich besseren Einblick und hört nicht ein und denselben Song in der vierten oder fünften Version. Zwei Sterne für die tolle Musik der frühen Rosenstolz-Jahre, die noch so richtig unschuldig klang...leider drei Sterne Abzug für die ""Abzocke"", die hier von Trittbrettfahrern betrieben wird."
5,"&gt;Centoundici&lt; ist alles andere als einfach. Wer Tizianos Vorgänger kennt, wird hohe Erwartungen mitbringen - aber nicht enttäuscht. Elektronisch aufregend (111), sexuell erregend (Perverso), total verwirrend (In bagno in aeroporto)und tief tief tiefgründig (Ti voglio bene, Sere nere) . So viele Seiten, die es an diesem Künstler zu finden gilt und was Tiziano wagt, muss einfach gewinnen."
5,"Carlos Santana und Ex-Hendrix Drummer Buddy Miles in einer gigantischen Liveperformance in Japan, in einem erloschenen Vulkan! Das ist vielleicht die intensivste Liveplatte, an der Santana je beteiligt war. Obwohl der Sound dieser Scheibe nicht ganz perfekt ist, wird hier abgerockt und gejammt, als gäbe es kein Morgen mehr! Selten hat man Carlos so rockig und leidenschaftlich Gitarre spielen hören wie hier. Und die Band macht derart Feuer, daß man vergißt, das hier in einem erloschenen Vulkan aufgespielt wird! Hitziger, wilder und energetischer geht es fast nicht mehr. Zudem überzeugt Miles als irre beseelter Sänger und spielt dazu ja auch noch sein außerirdisches Voodoo-Drum - Genial. Das Repertoire umfaßt dann auch als besondere Leckerlis, ""Changes"" aus der Hendrix/Band of Gypsys Kiste und sogar im Fundus von John Mc Laughlin wird bravourös gekramt. ""Evil Ways"" und ein monströser Jam finden sich auch noch auf der Scheibe. Eine absolute musikalische Orgie! Jedem Fan von kreischenden Gitarren und unbändiger Power etc. UNBEDINGT! ans Herz gelegt. Ein Live-Monolith..."
5,"Das Debutalbum von Santana (1969) darf in keiner Liste der 100 besten oder wichtigsten Rockalben fehlen. Es führte afrokubanische Percussionelemente und Instrumente wie Congas, Bongos, Timbales sowie allerlei Schepper- und Rasselgeräte mit einer Urgewalt in die Rockmusik ein, die im Woodstock-Jahr für Furore sorgte. Ohne den Auftritt dort wäre Santana vielleicht eine Lokalcombo der San Francisco Bay Area geblieben - wer weiß. Aber Woodstock hat stattgefunden. Das fulminante, durch den Film zur Legende gewordene ""Soul Sacrifice"", bei dem die Musiker alles gaben, hatte die Rockszene elektrisiert und das erste Album der Band überzeugte ebenso in seiner ungezügelten Wildheit."
4,"Eines vorweg: Floor Jansen beherrscht ihr Metier wie keine Zweite. Sehr ausdrucksstark und abwechselnd kraftvoll, dramatisch, rockig und gefühlvoll bringt sie ihre Stimme ein und lässt die Gesangslinien dabei unverwechselbar über den härteren Sound des Albums hinwegfegen. Einfach genial! Die Musik ist dem Genre entsprechend gewohnt kraftvoll, harte Gitarren und treibende Drums verschmelzen auf Keyboardteppichen mit symphonischem Bombast. Die Songs sind weniger eingängig als bei anderen genretypischen Bands und schrauben sich dennoch nach mehrmaligem Hören ins Ohr.  Der Hörer wird von der ausströmenden ""Energie"", die das Hauptthema des Albums darstellt, regelrecht mitgerissen. Hervorzuheben sind neben dem als Single erschienenen ""Energize me"" auch insbesondere der Opener ""Discord"", gefolgt von  ""Evoke"" und ""Transistory"", das abwechslungsreiche ""Equally destructive"", das sanfte ""Cry with a Smile"", der epische 11-Minüter ""Dreamflight"" und ""Empty memories"", bei denen Floors Stimme besonders gut zur Geltung kommt. Was mir persönlich weniger zusagt sind die zwischendrin sehr dominanten Growls, das einzige Manko dieses Albums (daher der Punktabzug...). Aber das ist reine Geschmackssache und soll dem Gesamteindruck keinen allzu großen Abbruch tun ;-). Jammerschade, dass sich die Band kürzlich aufgelöst hat. Nun hoffe ich auf andere, neue Projekte mit Floor als Sängerin."
5,"1994 war's, da kam diese Debut-Scheibe von Machine Head raus - und fegte alles bisher dagewesene vom Tisch. Rob Flynn und seine Mannen präsentieren ein agressives, unglaublich dichtes Album, auf dem eigentlich jeder einzelne Song Hit-Qualitäten hat. Die Kritik war damals wie heute begeistert, die Plattenläden wurden gestürmt und Machine Head erspielte sich eine Fangemeinde, die noch heute die Konzerte stürmt. Der charakteristische Sound mit der gezielt eingesetzten Gitarrenrückkopplung ging zwar über die Jahre etwas verloren, feiert aber auf der neuesten Scheibe (""Through The Ashes Of Empires"") ein tolles Comeback. Beim damaligen Kampf um den Titel ""härteste Band der Welt"" konnte sich Machine Head mit diesem Album mit Größen wie Sepultura und Slayer mehr als nur messen. Eine der einflußreichsten Scheiben ihrer Zeit - muß man einfach zu Hause haben."
5,"3 Worte, die nicht annähernd ausreichen. Ich habe mir das Album mal zugelegt weil ich gesehen habe, dass die Jungs laut Amazon von vielen Leuten gekauft werden die auch ""meine"" Musik kaufen. Warum habe ich von diesen Typen bisher noch nichts gehört? Es dauert exakt 30 Sekunden, bis man von Ten Thousand Fists nicht mehr losgelassen wird, nämlich vom Drücken der Play-Taste bis zu dem Moment, in dem David Draiman das Wort ""Survivor"" kreischt. Der Mann ist ein bisschen wie Chester Bennington: Eine urgewaltige und gleichzeitig gefühlvolle Stimme; schreit ohne an Melodiösitat zu verlieren.  Dazu kommt, dass die Texte - ausgenommen der des Openers - echten Tiefgang aufweisen und durchdacht und ehrlich wirken.  Das musikalische Gerüst schlägt nach meiner Auffassung gekonnt die Brücke zwischen konventionellem Metal (daran erinnern die schnellen, wechselnden Drums sowie einige Gitarren-Riffs und der Sound des Sängers) und dem NuMetal (wo die Melodien und die Texte eher reinpassen). Ich kann nicht beschreiben, woher diese mitreißenden Qualitäten kommen, die einem immer wieder zum Einlegen dieser Scheibe und zum pausenlosen Hören und Lesen der Texte bringen, aber sie sind da. Man glaubt es erst wenn man's hört! ""Ten Thousand Fists"", das ist Musik zum Entspannen, wenn man sich aggressiv und gestresst fühlt. Das ist Musik zum ""In die Nacht rausschreien"" wenn man alleine und vom Leben enttäuscht auf einem Berggipfel steht. Es ist einfach nur der Hammer!"
1,". . . wie ein wirklich talentierter sänger wie MM sich mit solchem material weit unter wert verkauft und leider auch verkaufen lässt. einer, der sogar von JOE COCKER für seine soulstimme gelobt wurde, lässt sich hier mit bohl'schem weichspülersound missbrauchen. einer, der mit solcher inbrunst YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL gesungen hat, darf sich für so eine belanglose dudelei nicht hergeben ! was wohl JOE COCKER jetzt über ihn sagen würde ? alle wundern sich, warum die dsds superstars auf internationaler bühne keinen blumentopf gewinnen. songs wie dieser hier sind die antwort. man stelle sich vor KELLY CLARKSON, LEONA LEWIS oder gar PAUL POTTS, die ja allesamt gewinner von castingshows waren, würden sich für solch einen schund hergeben . . . kein hahn würde nach ihnen krähen. mark, befreie dich von dieter bohlen und folge deiner SOULstimme !"
5,"Ja auch ich habe die CD gestern vom Postboten bekommen und muss sagen bin bisher auch sehr begeistert. Ich hab mich schon an einige Lieder sehr gewöhnt bei anderen dauert es dann doch noch etwas. Ich denke, dass im Gegensatz zu ihrem ersten Album, Jennifer Rostock sich musikalisch etwas mehr ausgelebt hat. Das erste Album ja ist doch mehr von Punk und leichten Metal-Tönen gezirrt während das neue Album einen kleinen Richtungswechsel in die Pop und Rock-Szene macht was durch die verschiedenen und teilweise komplizierten instrumentalen Einlagen gar nicht so zum Ausdruck kommt. Die Lieder haben einen unwahrscheinlich schnellen Stil und man möchte glatt die Beine schwingen. Außerdem kommen einige Lieder ein bisschen so rüber wie von Schülerbands meist gesungen wird...z.B. ""Jung und schön"" hat einen ziemlichen Teenie-charme. Ich würde doch sagen die Zeit die sich JR für ihr neues Album genommmen haben, haben sie gut investiert. Alle Bandmitglieder kommen so ziemlich auf ihre Kosten. Das Schlagzeug kann wechselhafte und harte Töne von sich geben. Alex und Christoph werden sich auch über ihre Einlagen mit Bass und Gitarre gefreut haben. Alles in Allem ein sehr gelungenes Album, mir persönlich noch etwas zu ""Popig"" aber sonst eine echt geile Scheibe."
1,"Die meisten Stücke dieser eigentlich guten Zusammenstellung zeichnen sich durch eine äußerst schlechte Klangqualität aus - flach und ohne Dynamik, wie aus einem billigen Transistorradio. So macht das Anhören leider keinen Spaß. Bestenfalls geeignet für Leute, die die Songs bisher nicht kennen und mal einen ersten Eindruck davon bekommen möchten."
5,"Auf dieser CD sind die wichtigsten Songs der Hippie-Queen Melanie drauf! Die Aufnahmen sind, wie man sie sich besser nicht wünschen kann, denn sie stammen aus den frühen 70ern - Melanies beste Zeit! Die Hippiehymnen ""Lay down"", ""Peace will come"" und ""Ruby Tuesday"" findet man hier genau so wie die selteneren Songs (""Garden in the City"", ""Together alone"",...). Diese CD ist nicht nur was für Hippies, sondern für alle, die noch was von echter Musik verstehen!"
5,Das erste Mal Saltatio Mortis habe ich auf einer CD aus dem Orkus gehört! Und war begeister. Also sofort die ganze CD gekauft und ich wurde nicht enttäuscht! Diese Scheibe ist absolut ihr Geld wert! Eine super Mischung aus Mittelalter und Rock! Etwas für die alten Fans von Subway to Sally und In Extremo!
5,"Chris Pohl samt seiner vielen Projekte Einseitigkeit anzulasten, ist mit diesem Album vorbei. Noch immer ist Seelenschmerz überdurchschnittlich häufig Ziel der Wünsche meiner Gäste und Freunde in unseren Discotheken. Vielleicht eines der besten Album im Darkelectro schlechthin, welches einerseits sehr ausgewogen klingt (immer noch), und nach einmaligem anhören absoluten Ohrwurmcharakter beweist. Songs wie ""bloody pleasures"", ""soul of Ice"", ""der spiegel"" und/oder ""seelenschmerz"" sind Meilensteine und in ""meinen"" Discotheken und gar nicht mehr wegzudenken. Es ist mehr als eine künstlerische Empfehlung, es ist Top Ten unter meinen Faves. stay dark, Chris Fischer"
5,"Das nennt man mal wieder eine Top Ausgabe. Die neue Hitmen, neue Cansis, etliche tolle Rocco &amp; Bass-T Mixe, einen neuen Alex Megane RMX, der es in sich hat etc... Eine tolle Ausgabe, was die letzteren, etwas schlechteren Ausgaben entschädigt. Weiter so :-)"
1,"Warum heisst die CD Reihe nicht Future Dance? Denn mit Trance haben die enthaltenen Titel , ausser vielleicht 2 oder 3 Stück, nichts gemein. Es ist fast ausschliesslich Handsup und Dance enthalten, also ist das Wort ""Trance"" eine Irreführung. Entweder in ""Future Dance"" umbenennen oder aber mehr credible Trancenummern draufpacken. Es gibt genug gutes Material!"
1,"Grausig. Dieses Album muß ich nicht haben.  Geschenkt ist mir noch zu teuer. 1 Lied gefällt mir davon, der Rest ist zum vergessen. Habe mir von kurzem erst die ""Best of - Dance Remix"" aus 2008 erworben. Da muß ich sagen, sehr gut gemacht. Die gefällt mir. MFG Thomas"
5,"Erstaunlich, wie einer mit einem Schritt zurück einen Sprung nach vorn macht: Zurück zu den eigenen Wurzeln, zum stilvollen Erzählen und zum kraftvollen Verzweifeln und Hoffen nach der Art eines mittelalterlichen fahrenden Sängers: Geschichten aus alten Zeiten und von fernen Orten erzählen - und zwar so, dass man nicht anders kann als zuhören. Jetzt weiß ich es wieder, worauf ich über 20 Jahre lang gewartet habe. Viel Wässriges war seit der Getaway zu hören gewesen, dazwischen für den Fan vom alten Schlag nur vereinzelt kleine Eisschollen um grad nicht unterzugehen, dann ein Hoffnungsschimmer mit The road to freedom - jetzt erreicht der Fan endlich wieder Festland. Da sind wir wieder! Chris de Burgh wird sechzig - das kann man nicht fassen, wenn man die Stimme hört. Und man will nicht drüber nachdenken, jetzt, wo er wieder von vorne anfängt. Hört sich zu gut an, als dass es irgendwann vorbei sein dürfte."
1,Wie kann man so einen Schrott veröffentlichen ? Mit Abstand das übelste was ich seit Jahren gehört habe!
5,"Nach vier Jahren ist Alanis Morissette endlich mit einem neuen Album zurück. Und während sie sich für ihr letztes Album So-Called Chaos gerade einmal etwas über ein Jahr Zeit gelassen hat, was sich nach Meinung vieler auf die Qualität des Albums niedergeschlagen hat, so zeigt sich bei Flavors Of Entanglement"", dass ich das Warten mehr als gelohnt hat. Mit Guy Sigsworth als Produzenten hat Alanis ein Album aufgenommen, dass an vielen Stellen ganz anders klingt, als man es von Alanis gewohnt ist und somit auch die Menschen interessieren könnte, die sonst weniger von ihrer Musik halten, ohne dabei jedoch ihrem eigenen Stil untreu zu werden. Diese Fassung des Albums enthält ganze 16 Songs auf zwei CDs verteilt und reicht damit fast an die 17 Tracks auf Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, dem längsten Album von Alanis heran. Citizen Of The Planet 5/5 Citizen Of The Planet ist der erste Song dieses Albums und einer der Besten. Am ehesten lässt sich dieses Lied in die Kategorie Rock einordnen, der Chors ist laut und unterlegt mit Gitarren, die später von Streichern unterstützt werden. Vor allem das Ende ist genial. Man sollte sich in diesem Fall nicht von den ersten 15 Sekunden verunsichern lassen, die nahe legen, Citizen wäre ein an indische Musik angelegter Song. Die ersten 15 Sekunden sind das vielleicht, danach nimmt der Song jedoch eine komplett andere Richtung an und wird zu einem der Highlights dieses Albums. Underneath 4.5/5 Viele Kritiker jammern ja heute noch der Alanis hinterher die 1995 mit ihrem Album Jagged Little Pill"" die Welt eroberte. Während man Madonna jeder noch so kleine Veränderung als bahnbrechende Neuerfindung ihrer selbst zu gute legt, scheint man Alanis nie verziehen zu haben, dass ihre letzten vier Alben nicht einfach Jagged Little Pill 2-5 waren, sondern in unterschiedliche Richtungen gehen. Alanis hat sich viel weiter entwickelt, als ein Großteil der Stars, die Weiterentwicklungen als ihr Markenzeichen ansehen. Underneath, Alanis erste Single, erinnert noch am ehesten an die alte"" Alanis, gewisse Ähnlichkeiten mit Ironic lassen sich erahnen. Thematisch handelt es sich bei Underneath um die Aufforderung statt nach Lösungen für die größten Probleme in der Welt zu suchen, erst einmal in sich selbst zu schauen und mit sich selbst ins Reine zu kommen. Denn all die kleinen Probleme im Alltag seien doch nichts anderes, als das, was vergrößert in der großen Weiten Welt passiert.  Frei nach dem Motto sei der Wandel, den du selbst sehen möchtest"" ist Underneath ein solider Radio-Track der leider viel zu selten iM Radio gespielt wird. Straitjacket 4.5/5 Spätestens jetzt wird auch der letzte bemerkt haben, dass Flavors Of Entanglement kein Aufguss alter Rezepte, sondern komplett neues Territorium für Alanis ist. Der Einfluss Guy Sigsworths wird hier spürbar deutlich. Straitjacket ist elektronisch, ein bisschen wütend und vor allem ein sehr interessanter Song. Versions of Violence 5/5 Für mich der absolut beste Song des ganzen Albums. Alanis war mit Ausnahme von Pollyanna Flower"" nie so dunkel wie hier. Rock gemischt mit starken Electronica-Einflüssen lässt ein bisschen an Evanescence erinnern, allerdings zeigt Alanis starke und in den Strophen erstaunlich tiefe, fast schon maskuline Stimme, wo die Unterschiede zu eben dieser Band liegen. Ein sehr ausdrucksstarker Song, der mit relativ simplen Texten auskommt, verglichen mit anderen Alanis-Songs natürlich. Nach einem ganz unverhofften Ende dieses Songs kommt schließlich... Not As We 5/5 Ein weiterer positiver Aspekt dieses Albums ist die Vielseitigkeit von ""Flavors of Entanglement"". Bis jetzt hatten wir Rock, Pop und Electronica, nun kommt eine Ballade hinzu, deren Kontrast zu Versions of Violence nicht größer sein könnte. Alanis Stimme wird nur von einem Klavier begleitet und klingt hin und wieder etwas brüchig, was die traurige Aussage dieses Songs treffend unterstützt. Die Trennung von ihrem langjährigen Lebensgefährten Ryan Reynolds hat Spuren hinterlassen, auf ihrer Seele, aber auch auf diesem Album. Not As We ist ein Beweis dafür. In Praise of the Vulnerable Man 4/5 Wieder großer Kontrast zum vorhergehenden Song, der thematisch an Surrendering und Everything anknüpft. Im Vergleich zu den vielen Highlights dieses Albums geht In Praise ein wenig unter, ist es doch ein süßer Sommer-Song, des Alanis Stimme an manchen Stellen ungewohnt hoch und weich präsentiert. Moratorium 5/5 Moratorium ist wieder etwas anderes. Der längste Song der Standard-Ausgabe des Albums präsentiert sich mit vielen unterschiedlichen Elementen. Neben den Streichern und natürlich Alanis Stimme wird dieser Song vor allem von einem starken Drumloop dominiert, der immer wieder aufgebrochen wird um die Streicher sowie Alanis chorale Gesangseinlagen in den Vordergrund zu rücken. Alanis erklärt in dem Song eine Auszeit von zwischenmenschlichen Verwicklungen nehmen zu müssen um sich ihrer selbst wieder klar werden zu können Torch 5/5 Nach Not As We haben wir mit Torch einen weiteren Song, der die schmerzhafte Trennung von Ryan Reynolds zu thematisieren scheint. Alanis zählt auf, welche Qualitäten sie an ihrem Exfreund vermisst. Ein sehr emotionaler Text steht hier einer im Vergleich zu anderen Songs nicht ganz so interessanten Instrumentierung gegenüber. Ein sehr schöner und gefühlvoller Song, der etwas Entspannung vor dem großen Finale mit sich bringt. Giggling For No Reason 4.5/5 Die letzten drei Songs dieses Albums zeigen noch einmal die Vielseitigkeit, die Alansi und Guy Sigsworth in diesem Album an den Tag gelegt haben. Wieder ein sehr elektronischer und damit für Alanis Morissette ungewöhnlicher Song, der ungewohnt hoch gesungen ist. Giggling läd dazu ein, das Autoradio laut zu drehen, die Fenster runterzufahren und nach Möglichkeit das Verdeck zu öffnen um dann an einem sonnigen Nachmittag über irgendeine Landstraße dahin zu fliegen. Dabei verstahlt es eine Unbeschwertheit, die im Kontrast zum nächsten Song steht. Tapes 5/5 Tapes ist ein Song der sich im gewissen Sinne mit Selbstzweifeln und Selbsthass auseinander setzt. Innere Stimmen flüstern Alanis ein, sie sei zu anstrengend, um geliebt zu werden und gehöre am Besten vergessen und weggesperrt. Umrahmt wird dies von einem verdammt guten Refrain und einem sehr schönen Ende, das leider viel zu kurz geraten ist. Alanis chorale Gesangseinlage gepaart mit elektrischen Gitarren hätte ruhig ein bis zwei Minuten länger sein können. Eigentlich ein wunderschönes Schlussstück für ein Album, doch noch ist dieses nicht ganz vorbei. Incomplete 5/5 Nach dem traurigen Nachgeschmack, den Tapes hinterlassen hat, will Alanis ihre Zuhörer dann nicht ziehen lassen, ohne einen letzten Song zu singen, der an das Bild des Phoenix, der aus der Asche aufsteigt, erinnert. Incomplete macht Mut, sich mit den eigenen Unzulänglichkeiten abzufinden und statt sich auf die Suche nach Perfektion, die man wahrscheinlich nie erreichen wird, zu begeben sich lieber an den Dingen des Hier und Heute erfreuen soll. Dann klappt es auch mit einem glücklichen und zufriedenen Leben. Und dies sei all den Kritikern gesagt, die immer noch nicht verstanden haben, dass die Zeiten von You Oughta Know längst vorbei sind: Das Album vermittelt in der Zusammenschau den Eindruck, als sei Alanis langsam in ein Gleichgewicht gekommen, in dem sie sich wohl fühlt. Auch das Album selbst wirkt sehr ausgewogen. Trotz der vielen verschiednen Genres, die es abdeckt wirkt es an sich doch geschlossen. Wenn es sehr laut wird, wird es danach auch wieder leise, wenn es schnell wird, so wird es danach wieder langsam. Dieser Ausgleich hinterlässt den Eindruck eines sehr vielseitigen aber ausbalancierten Albums, dem ich mit sehr gutem Gewissen fünf Sterne geben werde. Allerdings verdient diese Ausgabe eigentlich noch mehr Sterne denn mit der zweiten CD erwarten den Käufer fünf weitere Songs, die keinesfalls Wegwerfprodukte sind, sondern qualitativ ohne Weiteres an die 11 Songs des Albums heranreichen oder teilweise noch besser sind. Orchid 5/5 Den Anfang macht ein Song namens Orchid, der in sofern bemerkenswert ist, da er Alanis Stimme in einer Art und Weise präsentiert, wie die vielen Menschen fremd sein dürfte. Wer denkt Alanis sei der Schreihals, der All I Really Want und Ironic krakelte, der liegt mit Sicherheit nicht falsch. Alanis Stimme ist das ein oder andere Mal etwas schrill, hier ist sie dies jedoch nicht.  Alanis Stimme präsentiert sich weich und zart umrahmt von einer ruhigen Instrumentierung die einen süßlichen und fast schon floralen Song ergeben, der als ein Highlight dieser Bonus-CD gesehen werden kann und zu den besten Songs der ganzen Session gehört. The Guy Who Leaves 3/5 Im Gegensatz dazu ist The Guy Who Leaves einer der schwächeren Songs, aber ein nicht minder interessanter. Gesang und Instrumentierung sind irgendwie ungewöhnlich und gehen nicht sofort ins Ohr. Trotzdem ein Song, den man sich mehr als einmal anhören sollte, da er viele Facetten aufweist, die es zu entdecken gilt. Madness 4.5/5 Madness ist der längste Song der as dieser Session bis dato veröffentlicht wurde und er ist der längste Alanis-Song überhaupt bis jetzt. Ein sehr ruhiger Track, der hauptsächlich aus einer Klavierbegleitung besteht, gegen Ende dann jedoch um einige andere Instrumente physischer und digitaler Art erweitert wird, ohne jedoch in ein krachendes Finale à la Uninvited zu münden. Auch wenn das Lied mit 6:21 Minuten sehr lang ist, hat man das Gefühl, dass es viel schneller vorbei ist. Alles in allem ein sehr schöner und verträumter Song. Limbo No More 5/5 Wieder eine Ballade - und was für eine. Ein sehr dominantes Streich-Arrangement tritt vor allem in der zweiten Hälfte zum Vorschein und macht aus dieses Lied zu einem Schatz, der einem entgeht, wenn man sich auf die Standard-Fassung dieses Albums beschränkt. Sehr sehr hörenswert On The Tequila Wer On The Tequila zum ersten Mal hört denkt wahrscheinlich Alanis stecke nun tatsächlich in der Zwangsjacke, die sie in Track 3 des Albums besingt. Nichts von all dem, was Alanis bis jetzt dargeboten hat, hätte ein solches Lied erahnen lassen. Ein bisschen verrückt, ein bisschen seltsam aber irgendwie doch kein schlechter Party-Song ist On The Tequila der im Vergleich zu Alanis anderen Songs mit teils sehr komplizierten Themen eher belanglos wirkt. Wahrscheinlich werden sich hier die Geister scheiden, wer diesen Song als Witz seitens Alanis versteht liegt wahrscheinlich richtig und hat ihre Art von Humor erkannt. Ich könnte aber auch verstehen, wenn jemand dieses Lied als eines der schlechtesten seit langem bezeichnet. Deshalb verzichte ich auf eine Bewertung, hier muss sich jeder seine eigene Meinung bilden. Abschließend lässt sich sagen, dass die zweite CD unbedingt hörenswert ist, sich aber schnell zeigt, warum diese Leider ausgelagert wurden und nicht auch noch auf dem eigentlichen Album enthalten sind. Bei den Bonus-Tracks handelt es sich hauptsächlich um Balladen und langsame Stücke, die das Tempo aus Flavors Of Entanglement herausgenommen und die Ausgewogenheit zunichte gemacht hätten.  Ich lege diese Fassung des Album jedem ans Herz, der sich ein bisschen für Alanis und ihr neustes Werk interessiert, da es einen tieferen Einblick in den Schaffensprozess des Albums liefert und vielleicht hilft, Alanis Musik noch mehr zu verstehen, zu schätzen und zu genießen."
5,"Auch wenn hier durchgängig ein Stil (Swing) gepflegt wird, ist das Album an keiner Stelle eintönig. Das mag an der hervorragenden Auswahl liegen, eine interessante Mischung aus Klassikern wie ""Bei mir bist du schön"" oder ""Mr. Sandman"" und jüngeren Titeln wie ""Wuthering Heights"" von Kate Bush oder ""Panic"" von The Smith. Die Klassiker sind elegant eingespielt und - glaubt man dem Booklet - entsprechen meist den Arrangements der Vorlage. Tropisch schwül wird's bei ""Sway"", aufregend jedoch sind die modernen Adaptionen: bei Kate Bush schleichen sich Flaschen als Instrumente ein, bei ""Heart of Glass"" von Blondie eine singende Säge. So werden musikalisch und ästhetisch die Vierziger beschworen, mit Ernst und Strenge, aber auch einer gehörigen Augenzwinkerei, gerade wenn die Puppini Sisters etwa singen: ""panic on the streets of London, dubdida"", um dann in perfektem Satzgesang fortzufahren zu fordern ""hang the DJ hang DJ hang the DJ, badubndida"". Gerade diese jüngeren Kompositionen sind denn auch die Highlights des Albums, wird doch hier respektlos der Spieß umgedreht: nicht das Alte wird auf jung genudelt, nein, die 80er Jahre-Kompositionen werden frech in die Vierziger verortet und siehe da - das Kleid steht ihnen. Schade, dass diese CD viel zu schnell zu Ende ist. Bei mir ist sie schön."
2,"Trotz des etwas fortgeschrittenen Alters seines Masterminds, eilt die Mittelalter-Rock-Band Blackmores Night weiter von Konzert zu Konzert und bringt alle paar Jahre eine neue Scheibe raus. Seit 27. Juni 2008 liegt nun das sechste Studio-Album (die Weihnachts-CD nicht mitgerechnet) mit dem Titel SECRET VOYAGE vor.  Leider entpuppt sich das neue Album als recht belanglos, denn wirklich Neues gibt es kaum. Die üblichen Zutaten sind zwar vorhanden, aber irgendwie wirkt alles recht lieblos und oberflächlich. Von den 12 Tracks ist nur einer wirklich gut und dabei handelt es sich ausgerechnet um das gleich am Anfang postierte Instrumentalstück GOD SAVE THE REG.  Ein bisschen reines Gitarren-Gezupfe von Altmeister Ritchie Blackmore, einige traditionelle Melodien mit belanglosen Lyrics vermischt und fast reinrassiges Pop-Gedudel. All dies findet man auf SECRET VOYAGE und dazu noch eine recht misslungene, unnötige Cover-Version von CANT HELP FALLING IN LOVE. Mit TOAST TO TOMORROW ist auch wieder eine Sauf- und Schunkelnummer vertreten.  Natürlich war schon der Vorgänger THE VILLAGE LANTERN kein Vergleich zu den gelungenen ersten vier Alben, doch die neuste CD enttäuscht fast durch die Bank. Sängerin Candice Night agiert wie bisher mit solider Stimme, doch erst Live erkennt man ihr Potential.  Als Bonus gibt es auf dem DVD-Teil der Scheibe ein Musikvideo zum Titelsong des letzten Albums, THE VILLAGE LANTERN. Würde man nicht wissen, von was für einer Band die CD stammt, so könnte man aufgrund des dunklen CD-Cases auf die Idee kommen, es handelt sich hier um das Album einer (Pseudo-)Gothic-Formation.  Fazit: Belangloser (Mittelalter-)Pop ohne gro0e Nachwirkung. Zwei Sterne."
5,"Ein einziges Stück, 60 Minuten lang, findet sich auf dieser CD. Eine Fülle von Stilrichtungen und Musikinstrumenten (die übrigens so gut wie alle von Hand gespielt sind). Bemerkenswert ist auch der afrikanische Touch (dank Trommler und Chor aus Afrika), der das letzte Drittel des Werkes dominiert. Beim ersten Anhören, bereits beim Intro (!), wenn kreischende E-Gitarren plötzlich ein leises, ruhiges Thema zerhacken, wird man wohl denken ""mein Gott, was ist denn das?"". Aber mit der Zeit gewöhnt man sich daran und wird es lieben (oder auch nicht, man sollte sich jedoch diese Musik *unbedingt* einmal antun). AMAROK ist das am wenigsten verkaufte Mike Oldfield Album, nicht nur, weil es absolut ungewöhnlich ist, sondern weil die Plattenfirma Virgin es absichtlich nicht richtig vermarktet hat, aufgrund von Streitigkeiten mit Oldfield in jener Zeit. Wenn ihr keine ""cloth-eared nincompoops"" seid, gebt dieser Musik eine Chance! ;-)"
4,"Endlich mal wieder keine dreihundertste Tubular Bells Version. Als treuer Fan habe ich mir die CD ungehört gekauft und muß sagen, das Warten hat sich gelohnt. Die 1. CD gefällt durch ihre Ruhe und schönen Klavierpassagen. Die 2. CD weiß durch Groove zu gefallen. Leider hat Mike Oldfield einiges von sich ""ausgeliehen"". Ja einiges klingt sehr vertraut. Ein Stern Abzug muß ich jedoch geben, da die CD mir zu komerziell ist und das alte Gefühl, den Flair der alten Stücke vermissen läßt. Schade. Hätte mehr draus werden können."
4,"Nach ebenso vielen musikalischen Gastauftritten, wie dubios unverständlichen Aussagen über seine Einstellung zur Musik, kommt von Wunderstimme Michael Kiske doch glatt mal wieder was richtig Essentielles. Erstmals seit „Chamäleon"" veredelt die deutsche Goldkehle wieder ein komplettes Rock Album und stellt nachdrücklich unter Beweis, dass er noch immer zu den absolut besten seines Faches zählt. PLACE VENDOME ist ein, von Frontiers Boss Perugino ins Leben gerufenes AOR All Star Projekt bei dem neben Zugpferd Kiske die gesamte PINK CREAM 69 Fraktion, sowie VANDENPLAS Keyboarder Günter Werno vom Infoblatt prangern und nichts anderes als höchste Erwartungen aufkeimen lassen."
5,"Das Michael Kiske singen kann, wissen wir alle... Das Pink Cream 69 eine a***h-tighte Band ist, dürfte auch bekannt sein... so verwundert es nicht, dass viele songs, bzw. riffs sehr Pink Cream-lastig ausgefallen sind, nur durch das hervorragend eingesetzte und gespielte Keyboard etwas ""verweichlicht"" werden, im Falle Place Vendome jedoch super rüberkommt!!! Wer auf genialen Gesang mit Hammer-Reffrains, Wahnsinns-Riffs, eine treibend-tighte Rhythm-section und songs mit vielen eingängigen Melodien, die vom Produzenten ein hervorragendes Soundgewand verpasst bekommen haben steht, kann hier nichts falsch machen!!!!!"
5,"Mit diesem Debutalbum haben sich die schwedischen Metaller in kürzester Zeit 1000de von Fans und ausverkaufte Touren erspielt. Jedes der 9 Songs knallt und man spürt förmlich den ""Hammer fallen"", wenn Hymnen wie ""Child of the Damned"" oder ""Steel meets Steel"" aus den Lautsprechern brechen. Jedes einzelne Stück hat seinen eigenen Charakter, seinen Höhepunkt findet es dann in der unbeschreiblichen Hymne ""Glory to the Brave""(7 Min.). Weiter sehr positiv aufgefallen ist mir das Cover-Artwork, welches einen schon auf die brachiale Musik einstimmt, welche einen erwartet."
5,"Ein tolles Album, das wirklich überzeugt. Es gibt keine Ausfälle."
2,"Hammerfall hat das Problem vieler Rock/Metal-Bands: der Sänger ist einfach nicht ausdrucksstark. Er heult irgendwie nur rum. Man möchte dem CD-Player glatt ein Taschentuch reichen. Die Songs würden bei mir vielleicht noch zünden, aber der Sänger verhindert irgendwie, dass ich die CD mehr als 4-5 Mal gehört habe."
1,"Ok, ich gebs ja zu: Ich bin nicht unbedingt der größte Hammerfall-Fan unter dem nördlichen Sternenhimmel, aber das Ding ist nun wirklich gruselig mies :( Waren auf den ersten beiden Scheiben wenigstens nocht gute Songs mit Wiedererkennungswert (z. B. Unchained) zu finden, isses hiermit bei ""Renegade"" völlig Essig. Nix, gar nix.... Das klingt alles irgendwie völlig uninspiriert, gerade so, als hätte ein Produzent ne Menge Versatzstücke aus dem Baukasten ""Europäischer Powermetall für Einsteiger"" aus der Grabbelkiste geholt und diese wahllos zusammengesetzt. Gut, ich hab' ja gar nicht erwartet, daß das Rad neu erfunden wird, aber ein wenig mehr Anstrengung hätte ich da schon erwartet. Da passen Cans piepsiger ""Gesang"" (hat der in der Pubertät eigentlich immer zu enge Hosen getragen?) und die gewohnt schmalzigen, um nicht zu sagen schleimigen ""Powerballaden"" wie die Faust aufs Auge. Nee, sorry, das war nix...."
4,"Bereits im Januar 2009 erschien ""Into The Labyrinth"" und wurde wieder von Biff Byford (Vocals), Paul Quinn und Doug Scaratt (Guitars), Nibbs Carter (Bass) und Nigel Glockler (Drums) eingespielt, die wohl beste Besetzung der Gruppe überhaupt. Das 19. Studioalbum von Saxon wurde wieder von Charlie Bauerfeind produziert.  ""Into The Labyrinth"" ist nicht so düster wie der Vorgänger ""The Inner Sanctum"", ""Labyrinth"" ist typischer für Saxon mit bietet mit den Songs `Battilions of steel`, `Live to rock` und `Valley of the kings` drei absolute Kracher, wie sie nur von den Kreuzrittern kommen können. Heavy Metal as its best. Mit `Demon Sweeney Todd` und `Hell cat` sind auch zwei richtig schnelle Songs am Start, wobei mir `Hell cat` irgendwie nicht besonders gefällt. Der Refrain ist schon sehr `komisch`. Überhaupt schwächelt das Album in der 2. Hälfte ein wenig. Auch das bereits von der ""Killing Ground"" von 2001 bekannte `Coming home` in der Bottleneck Version kann mich nicht überzeugen.  Trotzdem ist das Album sehr gelungen, die Gruppe um Tante Biff liefert somit seit ""Dogs Of War"" (1995) bzw. dem Nachfolger ""Unleash The Beast"" (1997) nur erstklassiges Material ab. Hut ab vor der Leistung der Gruppe. Sehr starke 4 Sterne für das ""Labyrinth"".  Play it loud!"
5,"Nach solch traurigen Machwerken wie Hexen-Handy wieder mal ein echtes Highlight. So müssen ??? Hörspiele sein. Justus in Hochform, ein paar Dracula Anspielungen zu Beginn und eine schlüssige Auflösung eines kniffligen Rätsels. Mir hat es sehr gut gefallen, absolut kurzweilig und spannend. Mehr davon!!!"
1,"...Ich Glaube es ja nicht. Wie kann man diesen armen Typen, noch einmal so ein Sinnloses und absolut schreckliches Album machen lassen?"
1,"Ich hatte mir ehrlich mehr erhoft... die scheibe habe ich einmal gehört und gleich zum weiterverkauf angeboten. Es ist wirklich sehr belanglose musik das ganze. der vergleich mit jack johnson ist wirklich daneben, damit tut man der guten colbie keinen gefallen. Wäre eine slide guitar zu hören hätten wir es mir einer lupenreinen country platte zu tun. nee, liebe Colbie das war nichts.... bleibt zu hoffen, dass die nächste platte mehr ecken und kanten verpasst bekommt. lieber erstmal reinhören und dann kaufen."
1,"Eine schlimme Entwicklung, diese sogenannten Radiohits!!! Einen der übelsten Songs hat da Jael Naim mit ""New Soul"" im Ärmel. Was an diesen Vorschulgedudel, Kindergartenrefrain und der wirklich unterentwickelten Stimme gut sein soll, weiss der Geier!!!!!!!!! Ja, ja, der anspruchslose Hörer wird sich freuen, Leute mit Ahnung wenden sich angewidert ab und geniessen hochwertige Musik!"
2,"Seit mehr als 40 Jahren im Schaugeschäft hat der alte irische Kauz nix verlernt, aber auch nix dazu gelernt. Er nuschelt sich durch seine maximal midtempo Songs durch ewig gleiche Strukturen mit bekannten Melodien in derselben musikalischen Besetzung. Seit dem letzten Meisterwerk ""Common One"" nun fast ein beinahe Stillstand. Wer in den letzten 28 Jahre die Alben von Van the Man überhört hat, den wird`s vielleicht noch überzeugen..."
5,"Bereits seit 2 Jahren geistert der Name Tokyo Police Club"" durch einschlägige Musikinsider-Kreise. Und das noch, bevor die Band überhaupt ein Album draußen hatte. Nur durch gute Live-Shows und eine EP, die obgleich ihrer 8 Titel fast keine war, namens A Lession In Crime"", haben sie Aufregung erzeugt. Nun gibt's den ersten Langspieler, wobei der Begriff relativ gesehen werden muss. Sind ja auch nicht mal 30min. Aber wer sind diese Tokyo Police Club aus Kanada? Erfinden sie das Rad im Indierock endlich mal neu? Darauf ein klares: Nein! Aber das ist total egal. Was uns die Band mit ihrem kurzen Debüt präsentiert ist eine unglaublich schöne, kleine Fundgrube an Pophymnen! Elephant Shell"" ist in Sachen catchyness eine echte Ausnahme. Nur Hits, Ohrwürmer, dazu diese, ich sag mal, putzigen, kleinen Songs, die selten mal an der 3min Obergrenze schrammen. Elephant Shell"" ist wie eine frische Sommerbrise. An allen Ecken schreit es: Ich bin jung, ich hab Energie, ich will Leben"". Genau diesen Vibe versprüht dieses Album, wirkt dabei aber nie aufgesetzt, sondern unglaublich authentisch. Leicht schrammelnde Gitarren, Glockenspiel, ein flotter Beat und dazu Sänger Dave Monks, der manchmal fast nach Collin Meloy von den Decemberists klingt, und schönes zu erzählen hat. Von der Liebe, dem Leben und anderen Geschichten. Elephant Shell"" ist herrlich leicht, ohne dabei billig oder oberflächlich zu wirken. Hier sind Musiker am Werk, denen man den Spaß an der Sache mit jedem Beat anhört. So muss Indiepoprock klingen, dass er mich z.B. auch im x-ten Aufguss begeistern kann. Und begeistern können Tokyo Police Club wirklich. Herausragende Songs sind z.B. Juno"", Tessellate"" oder das wundervolle Your English Is Good"". Dieses Album macht Spass, Lust auf Sommer, Sonne, Strand, verrückte Aktionen und anderen Kram. Die nette Seite des Rock'n Roll sozusagen. Dieses Album ist gerade dabei, mir den Sommer zu verschönern und etabliert sich langsam in den vorderen Bereichen meiner Lieblingsplatten des Jahres. Für Freunde toller, packender Popmusik ist diese Platte dieses Jahr unverzichtbar. Und vermutlich auch noch in den nächsten Sommern."
5,"Bei diesem Album übertrifft sie sich selbst! Neben Ohrwürmern wie ""Stupid Girls"", welches meiner meinung nicht unbedingt die Stimmung des Albums widerspiegelt, gibt es u.a. soulig-rockige Reißer, bei denen ihre Stimme erst richtig zur Geltung kommt. Auch die Texte wie z.B. von ""Dear Mr. President"" sind mitreißend und regen zum nachdenken an. Ein sehr gutes Album, mit einer Mischung aus ""Missundaztood"" und ""Try This"" obwohl es sich eigentlich nicht richtig zuordnen lässt, da Pink bei jedem album die Richtung ein wenig ändert. Jedes Lied ist anders und sollte individuell betrachtet werden . P!nk macht ihr eigenes Ding und, dass das auch gut so ist, beweißt wiedermal ihr mittlerweile viertes Album! UNBEDINGT KAUFEN!!!!"
1,"""Chilling Lounge 2"" steht zwar auf dem Cover hat aber wirklich nichts mit der Cd zu tun. Sie hat nur 4 Euro gekostet, das merkt man an der Zusammenstellung. Jeder Song hat andere bpm, auf einen entspannenden Titel folgt auf einmal ein schneller, gepushter Titel. Wenn die Songs von schnell nach langsam auf dieser Compliation geordnet wären hatte was draus werden konnen. Fazit: sie ist nicht wirklich zu empfehlen"
1,"An sich eine nette CD, ABER das Lied ""10 Kleine Negerlein"" hat heute auf einer CD nichts mehr verloren."
5,"Wer Soulmusik mag, der wird Oleta Adams lieben. Eine der besten Stimmen überhaupt, wunderschöne Melodien und gelungene Zusammenstellung. Ich kenne Oleta Adams seit Ihren Duetten mit Tears for Fears auf dem ""Seeds of Love"" Album. Das anschließende Album ""Circle of life"" ist eines meiner Lieblingsalben bis zum heutigen Tag. Diese ""Very best of"" ist wirklich sehr geluzngen, da sie alle wichtigen Songs von Oleta erhält. Für Neueinsteiger die ideale Lösung, vor allem zu diesem Toppreis. Anspieltipps: Woman in Chains, Don't let the sun go down on me und get here."
1,"Der geneigte Leser sei gewarnt: Graffiti Soul kann leider in keiner Weise an das letzte Album ""Black &amp; White"" anknüpfen. Die hymnischen Bewertungen sind wohl mehr Fan-Reaktionen. Einzies Highlight ist das Anfangsstück ""Moskow Underground"", das von der Klasse her auch dort hineingepaßt hätte. Der Rest ist eher langweilig: Die Stücke jonglieren mit Midi-Sounds und typischen Stadion-Rhythmen der schlimmen und einfachen Gemüter aus den 80er und 90er Jahren. Peinlicher Endpunkt ist ""Rockin In The Free World"" die einen Neil Young zum Schadenersatz herausfordern sollte. Schade, die guten Reputationen nach ""Black &amp; White"" sind durch ""Graffiti Soul"" wieder  dahin."
1,"Ich habe soeben reingehört in diesen sogenannten Soundtrack und ehrlich gesagt frage ich mich was diese CD mit der Serie zu tun haben soll. Ich habe alle Staffeln auf DVD und muß ehrlich sagen das ich diese Lieder nicht kenne. Ich möchte gern Lieder, welche sich in der Serie eingebrannt haben.zB.Samantha mit Richard im Pool auf dem Hochhaus oder Carrie mit Mr. Big in Seiner Wohnung bei seinem Abschied. Dieses alte Lied was er ihr auf Platte vorgespielt hat.Wo alle in der Schwulenbar waren. Das wollen echte SatC- Fans hören. Also ich sage als überzeugter Viewer "" Hände weg"" von dieser CD. Sie wird dem nicht gerecht!!!"
5,"......Angie Stone scheint diese Zutaten anno 2001 gefunden zu haben. Die LP dürfte in jenem Jahr das beste Black Music Album gewesen sein dass überhaupt erschienen ist. Die gesamte Scheibe hat Seele und eine geballte Ladung Sexappeal, das sich von der ersten bis zur letzten Sekunde der Songs wie ein roter Faden durchzieht. Trotz des hohen Niveaus ragen dabei noch immer bestimmte Lieder wie etwa ""More than a woman to me"", ""The Ingredients"" oder aber auch die damals ausgekoppelte Single ""Wish I didn't miss you"" heraus.  Für mich ist bis heute unverständlich dass Angie Stone (und ihr Mann D'Angelo) damals nicht so recht den musikalischen Durchbruch in Europa geschafft haben. Mein Fazit ist daher etwas zwiegespalten. Eine außergewöhnliche LP die aber leider zu nicht nur zu den genialen sondern auch zu den verkannten Alben gerechnet werden muss....trotzdem, für mich steht fest: auch 5 Jahre nach dem Erscheinen der LP kann ich diese nur jeden nahe ans Herz legen - Kaufen und wohl fühlen.  so long P.S. Das wesentlich schlechtere Album ""Stone Love"" von 2004 ist nicht vergleichbar mit dieser Scheibe. Vielleicht waren die Zutaten nach dieser Platte ja auch schon aufgebraucht......"
5,"Eigentlich wurde schon genug über dieses Album geschrieben, aber was ich da so alles lesen musste, darf so nicht stehen gelassen werden.  Dieses Album soll komplex sein??? Der Song-Aufbau entspreche nicht mehr dem ""Vers/Bridge/Chorus""-Schema??? Das einzige Komplexe an diesem Album ist der letzte Track. Hier wiederholt sich nur wenig, aber auch dieser ist bekanntlich genießbar. Und die restlichen Lieder sind genau gleich aufgebaut wie die Songs auf ""Somewhere Far Beyond"" oder sogar ""Follow The Blind"". Meinetwegen wird mal ein kleiner Zwischenpart eingeschoben, aber mehr nicht. Am Song-Aufbau ist also absolut nichts zu kritisieren. Zudem halten sich alle Songs (mit Ausnahme des letzen, 14-minütigen) in einer akzeptabler Länge von 5 bis 6 Minuten.  Des Weiteren wird dem Album vorgeworfen, es ginge nicht ins Ohr. Dazu kann ich nur sagen: Absoluter Blödsinn! Entweder haben manche Guardian Fans nach dieser Langen Pause zuviel Mainstream-Talala abbekommen oder sie zeigen keinen Funken guten Willen. Wer bei ""Battlefield"" keine erkennbare Melodie raushört, kann ja wieder Freedom Call oder Rhapsody hören.  Der Vorwurf, die CD ginge erst nach dem x-ten Hördurchlauf in den Kopf, mag teilweise stimmen, aber was hat man von Blind Guardian nach ""Nightfall In Middle-Earth"" erwartet? Wieder den gleichen Speed Metal wie damals 1988? Auch diese Alben hatten ihren Reiz und sind immer noch hochwertig, aber Blind Guardian sind keine Band, die sich auf den Lorbeeren ausruht. Wer ihre fantastische Entwicklung kennt, muss zustimmen, dass sie absolut ehrgeizig und gleichzeitig talentiert sind. Was für eine Enttäuschung wäre es erst geworden, wenn sie uns nach so langer Wartezeit ein zweites ""Imaginations From The Other Side"" vorgelegt hätten?  Und für die Kritikern, die behaupteten, solche aufwendigen Songs wären live nicht mehr umsetzbar, gibt es nur eine Antwort: Das überragende Live-Album, das uns letztes Jahr erreichte. Man sieht, dass sich die Musiker was dabei gedacht haben und nicht etwa sinnlos ein ""überladenes Album"" rausgebracht haben.  Lange Rede, kurzer Sinn: Diese CD IST ein großartiges, dramatisches Werk voller neuer Ideen, das vor Kreativität geradezu sprudelt. Dazu sei bemerkt, dass sich die Drum-Arbeit von Thomas Stauch derart vielseitig und dominant in das Gesamtbild des Albums einfügt, wie man es selten erlebt hat. Doch ich bezweifle, dass die Ewiggestrigen und Konservativen das überhaupt bemerkt haben..."
1,"... wobei damit eigentlich schon zu rechnen war, da die Bravo Hits allgemein immer schlechter werden. Nun aber zu dieser ""Best-of"" 2003 Bravo-Hits:  Man könnte von einer CD, die eigentlich die besten Hits des Jahres bieten sollte, schon erwarten, dass zumindest mal alle Top-1 Singles dieses Jahres drauf sind. Aber nein! Hauptsächlich neuere, und zudem schlechte Lieder. Es fehlen auf dieser Doppel-CD folgende Nummer-1 Hits, die (unabhängig von deren Qualität) auf jeden Fall drauf gehören würden: 1)All The Things She Said - tATu (5 Wochen auf #1) Take Me Tonight - Alexander* (2 Wochen auf #1, Anmerkung siehe weiter unten)  2)You Drive Me Crazy - Daniel K. (2 Wochen auf #1) 3)In Da Club - 50 Cent (1 Woche auf #1) 4)Ich Denk an Dich - Pur (1 Woche auf #1) 5)Burger Dance - DJ Ötzi (1 Woche auf #1) 6)Unrockbar - Die Ärzte (1 Woche auf #1) 7)Where is the Love? - Black Eyed Peas (4 Wochen auf #1)"
5,"Wem schon PNAU's Songs ""With you forever"" und ""Freedom"" sonderbar berührt haben, wird bei ""EMPIRE OF THE SUN"" komplett emotional fündig.  Der anregend quere Sound-Kosmos aus Patos, hemmungslos kitschigen Eighties-Pop-Zitaten, ergreifenden Melodien und der einzigartigen Stimme Luke Steels ist absolut hörenswert, wenn nicht genial."
5,"Wo findet man denn nun die besten R.E.M.-Songs? Kommen die aus der Frühphase von Alben wie ""Murmur"" oder ""Document""? Sind es die Hits von ""Automatic For The People""? Nein, für mich sind es die Songs vom 1996er Album ""New Adventures In Hi-Fi"". Es vereint sozusagen das beste aus seinen beiden Vorgängern: Die schicken Popsongs und schönen Balladen von ""Automatic For The People"" treffen auf die härteren und kühlen Stücke vom ""Monster"", wohlgemerkt, dass diese hier befindlichen fast allesamt besser sind als die schwere ""Monster""-Kost."
5,"Wir haben die CD wegen des ""Fliegerliedes"" gekauft, sind aber auch vom ""Rest"" voll begeistert. Viele Gute-Laune- und Mitmachlieder, nicht nur für Kinder..."
1,"Offenbar versteht man unter Karaoke nicht immer dasselbe.... Leider sind die Texte lediglich im Cover schriftlich abgedruckt, der typische Mitlauftext am Karaokegerät fehlt. Ich habe mir etwas anderes vorgestellt, dieses können offenbar nur ""Popstars"" oder solche die es werden wollen."
4,WIE JEDES JAHR MIXT PAPA SVEN SEINEN MIX DIESES JAHR VERMISS ICH DIE AUSGEFALLENEN TRAX ! ABER WIE IMMER SHER SCHÖN !
2,"erwartet hatte ich von dieser CD schon ein wenig, denn der Name Big City Beats steht eig für gute compilations. Das Cover finde ich diesmal sehr gelungen, dafür gibt es schonmal n bonusstern in meiner wertung. leider muss ich mich den meisten rezesionen anschließen und sagen die meisten songs auf dieser CD sind uralt oder einfach nur schlecht. aktuell befinden sich viele hochkarätige songs auf dem markt, warum man dann diese trackzusammenstellung wählt ist mir auf gut deutsch ein rätsel. desweiteren kommt noch hinzu das die übergänge die schlechtesten sind die ich jemals gehört habe (aufenthalte in clubs schließe ich hierbei mit ein) was wirklich nur ein armutszeugnis ist! außerdem ist das tempo der CD wie ich finde etwas zu schnell was vor allem beim letzten track deutlich wird der eigentlich langsamer und ist und bei diesem tempo einfach nur hektisch wirkt. ich habe immer gehoft soetwas nicht schreiben zu müssen aber die BCB 6 hat mir leider keine andere wahl gelassen."
1,querbeet durch fast alles was NDW war. Kaum ist ein Titel angespielt kommt schon der Nächste. Mit diesem Mischmasch kann ich wenig anfangen. Deshalb schon im Schredder.
1,"Also nichts gegen A. Cooper, aber was hier einige Rezensenten reingeschrieben haben, stammt wohl direkt von der Plattenfirma. Best of, auf der alle wichtigen Titel drauf sind... Ja, aber ""Poison"" ist doch - siehe Titelliste - gar nicht drauf! Was soll das also für eine Best of-CD sein, wenn der Absatz durch - gedachte - gute Werke angeschoben werden muss. Die restlichen Werke sind natürlich nicht zu verachten, trotzdem wird der Sinn eines Best of- Albums hier unterminiert, darum: Nicht kaufen!"
4,"Ich kann hier so manch eine Rezension nicht verstehen. Kennen diese Personen, die hier dermaßen schlecht diese Gruppe bewerten, eigentliche deren Stil? Diese Platte ist superb aufgenommen und zudem bietet hier Fourplay nach der letzten Scheibe ""Journey"" wieder die Musik, die der Fourplay-Fan an sich, nur mögen kann. Es reicht allerdings nicht ganz an die Alben Heartfelt &amp; Co. ran, da auf dieser Platte sich Drummer Harvey Mason sehr zurück hält. Ich mag es, wenn auch er mal die Toms jagen darf, aber auf dieser Scheibe leider nicht oft, wenn überhaupt. Dennoch, ein absolutes Spitzen-Album! Auch ich muss hier darauf hinweisen, dass ein sehr hochwertiges HiFi-System von Nöten ist um die Musik ordentlich aufzulösen."
5,"Tito in Perfektion ! Nach 5 Jahren nun endlich wieder mal was vom Großmeister. Das Album hebt sich von den anderen ein wenig ab, aber der Hauch von Texas ist meiner Meinung nach geblieben. Titel Nr. 4 ""ashes and dust"" ragt für mich deutlich heraus, da man hier die alten Klänge vom leider ausgeschiedenen Peter (Gittarist) am ehesten erahnen kann. Also für mich ein absoluter Volltreffer !!"
5,"Ich selbst durfte den Graf erst kürzlich live in Nürnberg auf der ""Puppenspiel""-Tour erleben. Es war ein absolutes Highlight. Der Graf gibt 100 % für seine Fans und hat volle zwei Stunden durchgepowert. Für mich also keine Frage, mir diese live CD zu besorgen. Wer bisher noch nicht die Möglichkeit hatte, ""Unheilig"" live zu erleben, sollte sich diese Scheibe(n) unbedingt nach Hause holen. Ein unvergleichliches Erlebnis, toller Sound, der Graf in Bestform und alle Hits - ""Vorhang auf!"" toppt alles. Zugreifen, aufdrehen &amp; Gänsehaut haben..."
1,"So schön ""Libera Me"" war - das ist nur ein schaler Aufguss davon. Klingt, als wären damals noch ein paar mehr Tracks aufgenommen worden, die dann aber (zu Recht) nicht auf die CD kamen - und nun werden sie als ""neue"" CD veröffentlicht. Schade. Lars Danielsson kann viel mehr und hätte sich mehr Zeit lassen sollen. Bis zum nächsten (und hoffentlich besseren) Mal also."
4,"Das Einzige, was ich auszusetzen habe, ist die teilweise mangelnde Dominanz der Hörner (genaugesagt der Wiener-Hörner...). Im Vergleich zu anderen Aufnahmen kommen diese, besondern zu Beginn des 4. Satz, weniger stark hervor - Schade!"
5,"Ich weiss ja nicht, ob ihr das gleiche Album meint, aber ich finde das grüne Album mindestens genauso gut wie das blaue. Es gibt wirklich kein Lied, das mir nicht saumäßig gut gefällt. Im Gegensatz zum blauen Album konnte ich mich beim grünen noch nicht entscheiden, was mein Favourite ist, sie sind halt alle richtig genial. Und dass es so kurz ist (nicht mal ne halbe Stunde) macht mir persönlich wirklich gar nix, wozu hab ich denn einen ""Repeat""-Button? Ich könnte die Scheibe von bis abends hören, wenn sie meine einzige Weezer-CD wäre. Und was gibts am Cover auszusetzen? Gar nix. Ich finds schade, dass sie bei Pinkerton von dem schlichten Design abgewichen sind."
5,"A Trick Of The Tail, aus dem Jahr 1976, ist ein ebenso großes Meisterwerk, wie alle früheren Alben der Gruppe. Allerdings erschließt sich die Erste Platte mit Phil Collins als Sänger den Ohren schneller als zB. The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway, ohne kommerziell zu sein und in Pop - Gefilde abzudriften. Getragen von einem warmen und weichen Sound mit viel akustischer Gitarre, läd das Album sehr zum träumen ein. Besonders die Balladen, Entangled, Mad Man Moon und Ripples sind herausragend. Durchschnittliche Stücke sind nicht zu finden.  A Trick Of The Tail ist kein Genesis - Progressive - Stoff und kein Genesis für die Hitparade. Die Platte ist einfach nur schön und deshalb zeitlos. Die Romantische wäre wirklich ein passender Beinahme."
4,"Der erste Durchlauf: Überraschend der Opener ""Atom and Evil"", mit sperrig-vertrackter Struktur, fast ein Prog Metal Klassiker. In Folge: Leichte Enttäuschung und Ernüchterung, denn es scheinen tatsächlich die eingängigen Hits zu fehlen, die die Alben ""Heaven&amp;Hell"" und ""Dehumanizer"" so auszeichneten. Aber: Die Scheibe wächst und wächst, und erst mehrere Durchläufe enthüllen die Großartigkeit dieser Scheibe. Sie ist heavy, melodisch, atmosphärisch (Horrorstimmung a la Debütsong 'Black Sabbath' inklusive). Midtempo und doomige Langsamkeit wechseln sich gekonnt ab. Die Texte sind wunderbare Poesie - großes Kopfkino. Favoriten: 'Atom and Evil', 'Double the Pain', 'Eating the Cannibals', 'Follow the Tears'. Für mich gibt es hier keine Durchhänger oder Füllersongs, als Gesamtwerk ist diese Scheibe besser als Dehumanizer, letztere ist allerdings eingängiger und hat herausragendere Einzelstücke. Die Herren sind noch exzellent in Form, Hut ab vor Dios Stimme (auch live-habe H&amp;H  in Höchstform vor 2 Jahren im Vorprogramm von Metallica gesehen). Vier Punkte, da ""The Devil you know"" nie an die Glanzzeiten von Black Sabbath heranreichen wird - weder mit Ozzy noch mit Dio - und weil Herr Iommi seine Gitarre nicht mehr (durchgehend) so tief stimmt wie früher."
1,"Diese DVD-Audio eignet sich eher als Test Ihrer Heimkinoanlage, weil tatsächlich ortbare Töne aus verschiedenen Lautsprechern kommen. Aber vom Raumklang weit entfernt. Da habe ich schon besseres gehört. Ich denke daß man vorhandenes Stereo Material nicht einfach auf mehrer Lautsprecher mixen kann um Raumklang zu erhalten. Der Raumklang kommt am Besten bei 5.1 Life Aufnahmen. Davon ist auf dieser DVD scheinbar nichts drauf. Würde ich mir nichtmehr kaufen."
5,"Soul, Funk, stampfender 12-Takt-Blues, Reggae, Afro-Pop, düstere Delta-Grooves - alles hat der Alt-Meister drauf'.  Nichts wirkt aufgesetzt; stilsicher und überzeugend liefern Taj Mahal und seine prominenten Mitstreiter - Ben Harper,  Ziggy Marley, Los Lobos - ein Panoptikum Schwarzer Popular- musik ab, auch die technische Produktion ist tiptop. Ein kurzweiliges, sehr gutes Album."
5,"eigentlich hatte ich auf die DVD gewartet, die nun leider erst im Februar erscheint. Wie von genesis geplant, hab ich mir natürlich nun auch die cd angeschafft. top qualität, top sound! wie collins sagen würde: allen neuen stucka und allen alde, alde, alde stucka! totaler höhepunkt: RIPPLES! schönes booklett, da wünscht man sich schallplatten wieder, mit größeren bildern! ein absolutes muss, für fans und alle, die es nun endlich werden wollen! KAUFEN!"
5,"Um es kurz zu fassen, das ist keine Party Platte. Es ist eine geniale Mischung aus Neil Young, Air, Radiohead und Pink Floyd. Die Musik könnte ohne weiters von einen der oben gennanten Künstler stammen. Nur der Gesang ist eben typisch Beck. Auch da muß ich sagen hat er sich stark gemacht. Noch nie hat er so gut gesungen wie heute. Weiter so"
1,"Achtung, hierbei handelt es sich NICHT um ein neus Album von Nouvelle Vague!!!! Ich fühle mich, wie schon bei den 2 anderen Veröffentlichungen, ziemlich an der Nase herumgeführt!! Das ist keine Bewertung der vorliegenden CD nur eine reine Information!! Allerdings muss ich bewerten und wegen der Irreführung nur 1 Stern, inhaltlich kann ich es nicht, sorry"
5,"Wenn de Begriff ""Greatest Hits"" passt, dann auf diese Compilation, sechzehn großartige Lieder, die rocken und rollen! Besonderes Glanzlicht ist m.E. ""Rock'n'Roll Rendezvous"", aber die Frage des Lieblingsliedes bleibt natürlich jedem selbst überlassen.  Klasse Mucke, deren Platz in der deutschen Musikgeschichte nicht hoch genug liegen kann!"
1,"Gefiepste und Gepiepste, cut and click, mit einem Wort: Nerv! War ein Versehen, diese CD zu kaufen... Naja, Paul van Dyk für sich genommen geht hierbei noch, obwohl er auch schon bessere Sachen abgeliefert hat. Aber das alles auf dieser CD hat nicht viel mit Matyr zu tun, man ist höchstens einer, wenn man sie voll zu Ende hört..."
2,"Man hat mit dieser Auskopplung mit Sicherheit den falschen Titel gewählt. Man nimmt Kylie mit Sicherheit vieles ab, aber hier muss von einem Tiefpunkt zum nächsten gehen. Die Platte scheint auf schnelle und unprofesionelle Art gemacht zu sein, da hier keinerlei Höhepunkte kommen. Neue Maßstäbe werden hier nicht gesetzt und Kylie rutscht ab zu den ehemaligen Disco Queens."
4,"Das ist es wohl: das ""Meisterwerk"" der Hamburger Band TOMTE. An den richtigen Stellen glatter als der Vorgänger, ist jeder Song ein Treffer, jeder Song in einfachen Worten eine Offenbarung fern der Peinlichkeit, die sich trotz der Unmittelbarkeit nicht einstellen will. ""Es ist ein gutes Gefühl zu sagen, wir kennen uns noch in zehn Jahr'n!"" Das Album ist eine Hommage an die Freundschaft, die Liebe und an New York, die ""Stadt mit Loch"". Vielleicht hat Sven Regener Recht, wenn er behauptet, dass TOMTE genau die Songs geschrieben haben, die man gerne selbst geschrieben hätte. ""Den Traurigen die Welt erklären..."" Genau das funktioniert dank der greifbaren Passion, der Ehrlichkeit in Wort und Klang, dem immerwährenden Ringen um den Ton und des unverwechselbaren Klammerns an den Vokalen. Tomte sind halt einfach Tomte. In Zeiten wie diesen sind TOMTE vielleicht mehr als nur ein Unikat in der deutschen Musiklandschaft. ""Man fühlt sich, als habe man die Liebe erfunden"", singt Thees Uhlmann. Und wenn er ""Walter und Gail"" ein tonales Denkmal setzt, könnte das rührender nicht sein. ""Du hast gesagt, dass die Sonne scheint für den, der sie nicht mehr begehrt! Ich sag, die Sonne scheint so oder so!"""
1,"Ein Remix einiger Limp Bizkit Songs? Soll ich mich darauf nach dem entäuschenden ""Choclate star..."" einlassen? Was solls, was macht ein Fan nicht alles für seine Band? Kurz nach dem Einlegen wird mir aber schnell klar: Limp Bizkit sacken weiter in den Olymp der Mainstream Posemänchen á la Crazy Town ab. Schon das verhunzte Nookie ist zum gähnen und erinnert mich irgndwie eher an den Style von Missy Elliot als an die damaligen Helden aus Jackson Ville... Jedweder Härte ist aus den Tracks verschwunden und nur noch schlecht gemachter Hip Hop kommt aus meinen Boxen. Die einzigen guten Tracks sind für mich Faith/Fame und Counterfeit sonst gehört alles in die ""Restmüll"" Schublade... Für mich gilt jetzt: Wenn Limp Bizkit's nächstes Werk nicht wieder in die seeligen Gefilde eines Three Dollar Bill y'all zurück wandelt oder zumindest mal wieder ein paar härtere Tracks drauf sind wie auf ""signif"", dann haben die Jungs um Fred  Durst einen Fan weniger..."
5,"Kraftvoller Gitarrenrock und sanfte Gitarrenklänge wechseln sich auf diesem Abum ab. Musik mit Texten versehen, die der Qualtät hochwertiger Gedichte entsprechen. Kritik an unserer Gesellschaft ""..eure Silikonlippen sind Gedenkstätten unserer Zeit..."" ist genauso zu finden, wie Songs über Träume, die wir wohl alle schon geträumt haben oder immer noch träumen. Wer Songs mag, deren Texte auch Inhalt haben, wird dieses Album lieben."
1,"Bei aller Euphorie über diese  sicherlich gut gemachte  Scheibe, möchte ich dennoch einen Link zu der Gruppe ""Gorillaz"" (Titel: Feeld Good Inc.) schlagen. Hört einfach mal rein. Grüße."
2,"Da der Song (ich red jetzt mal nur von 36 Grad) gerade im Radio läuft, muss ich mich auch mal dazu äußern: Mit dieser Art Lied verbindet mich so eine eigentümliche Hassliebe... :-) Zweifellos: Der Text ist so was von blöd....Aber, das ist das Eigentümliche, er ist in seiner Blödheit schon fast wieder liebenswert, so dass man nicht drum rumkommt, irgendwie vor sich hinzulächeln, wenn der Song gespielt wird.Alles in Allem: In zwei, vielleicht schon einem Jahr wird sich außer den richtigen Fans niemand mehr sonderlich um diesen Song scheren (obwohl: Man soll ja nie ""Nie"" sagen). Also ein typisches Produkt und gleichzeitig Ausdruck einer gnadenlos oberflächlichen Gesellschaft, aber völlig harmlos und bestimmt nicht wirklich zur Volksverdummung beitragend (da gibt`s Schlimmeres). Sollte einem ein mildes Lächeln abgewinnen. Immerhin hat es-ob man will oder nicht-mitunter Ohrwurmpotenzial, und, jawohl, irgendwie freu ich mich, wenn man wenigstens im Radio ""36 Grad"" hat.... :-) Unter uns-manchmal summ` ich sogar mit..!"
2,"So breit wie in dem Video zu ""You Can Get It"" war Dieter Bohlens Grinsen schon lange nicht mehr. Kein Wunder bei dem vielen Geld und den Platinplatten, die er mit Hilfe seines neuen Schützlings wohl bekommen wird. Die Vergangenheit hat gezeigt, dass man Dieter Bohlen niemals unteschätzen darf, er hat wirklich einen untrüglichen Sinn für Geschäfte. Ebenso darf man den Musikgeschmack der Deutschen nicht überschätzen, denn der Dieter schreibt eigentlich immer wieder die gleichen Songs in einer anderen Verpackung. Das er sich dabei mit dem Englisch-Vokabular eines Schülers der 6. Klasse begnügt ist auch schon bekannt.  Dieter Bohlen macht Musik-Fastfood, dass bei der Menge ankommt. Ich möchte nicht bestreiten, dass ""You Can Get It""  einen gewissen Unterhaltungsgrad besitzt und die Stelle an der Bohlen so hoch singt gewiss ganz witzig ist (eher unfreiwillig komisch). Zudem hat Mark Medlock wirklich eine tolle, außergewöhnliche Stimme die das Ganze an manchen Stellen noch rausreißt. Alles in allem ist ""You Can Get It"" aber ein Song der schon tausendmal da war mit einem Text bei dem sich mein Magen umdreht.  2 Sterne gebe ich für Medlocks Stimme.  Ich hoffe nur, dass Mark Medlock sich irgendwann emanzipiert und mit eigenen neu rauskommt auch wenn er dann kommerziell vielleicht nicht mehr so erfolgreich ist wie mit Dieter Bohlen."
1,"Klar, musikalisch Anspruchsvolles oder gar Wertvolles war hier ohnehin nicht zu erwarten, das erschließt sich ja schon aus der Tracklist dieses Albums, aber ich musste beim Durchlauf dieser CD, die hier von den Medlock-Fans unerklärlicherweise mit Lobeshymnen überschüttet wird, jedoch nur den üblichen banalen Einheitsbrei der ersten beiden Alben und der jüngsten DSDS-CD wiederholt, mehrfach um Fassung ringen. Was um alles in der Welt ist so toll an diesem völlig belanglosen Stück Musik? Die Nummer 1-Single ""Summer Love"" geht ja vielleicht gerade noch so durch, den Rest kann man getrost in der Pfeife rauchen. Keine originelle Melodie oder irgendein tiefgründiger Text, nicht auch nur eine gute Idee oder zumindest irgendetwas Neues, sondern wieder nur die üblichen anspruchslosen Tralala-Lieder, die man so oder in leicht variierter Form schon hunderte Male gehört hat. Auch Mark Medlocks zugegebenermaßen herausragende Stimme kann die Einfallslosigkeit dieser CD nicht übertünchen und es stellt sich sehr schnell Monotonie und Langeweile ein. Trotzdem wird sich auch dieses bereits dritte Album des Sängers ohne Zweifel seinen Weg in die oberen Regionen der Charts bahnen und vielleicht sogar Platz 1 erobern, aber ob die Veröffentlichungspolitik mit 2 CDs pro Jahr und dem immer gleichen Inhalt auf Dauer gut geht, wage ich doch stark zu bezweifeln. Ich würde ja wirklich nichts sagen, wenn das Ding auch nur einen Hauch von Unterhaltungswert besäße, aber hier erwartet den Zuhörer wirklich nur die absolute Langeweile."
5,"Wie sagte Dieter Bohlen bei der Finalshow von DSDS so schön: ""Danke Mark, dass Du meinen Song so toll gesungen hast!"" Und ich danke nun beiden, sowohl Dieter Bohlen als natürlich Mark Medlock, für diesen wunderschönen Song, der mir immer wieder auf's Neue unter die Haut geht, mich immer wieder auf's Neue berührt!  Ein wirklich schöner Song, den man sich immer wieder gerne anhört - und den Mark Medlock's Stimme zu etwas ganz Besonderem macht...eine Stimme, so unglaublich soft und gefühlvoll &amp; gleichzeitig so ausdrucksstark &amp; kraftvoll. Ich hoffe, dass wir noch sehr viel von dem sympathischen Sänger mit der tollen Stimme &amp; Deutschland's erfolgreichstem Musikproduzenten hören werden! Fazit: gehört in den Warenkorb &amp; gekauft"
5,"Ich hatte das Glück, einer der ersten zu sein, die das Musical sehen konnten. Nun habe ich endlich die Musical CD mit der originalen Cast. Schon bei dem ersten Lied hatte ich das Gefühl, wieder im Hamburger Hafen zu sitzen. Die CD ist sehr empfehlenswert."
5,"Was Die Toten Hosen mit diesem Longplayer geschaffen haben, ist schlichtweg Spitzenklasse. Bei Rock am Ring wurden ja schon 2 neue Lieder gespielt. Nämlich ""Innen alles Neu und ""Teil von mir"". Beide songs waren Spitze, obwohl ich mich in den Letzteren regelrecht verliebt habe, wegen seiner eingängigen Melodie und der kompromisslosen Härte. Übrigens fehlt diesmal auch der typische Partysong wie ""Kein Alkohol ist auch keine Lösung"" Mit ""In aller Stille beweisen DTH dass sie erwachsener geworden sind und Gefühle ausdrücken können, ohne dabei weich und poppig zu klingen. Spitzenalbum!!!"
2,"Schade, je jünger die CD, desto flacher der Inhalt! Vielleicht ist das Titelbild auch Symbol. Die beiden schauen sich nicht an, weil ihre Herzen nichts gemeinsames mehr zu sagen haben? Übrig geblieben ist leichte Esomucke, die man zwar ohne größere Probleme mal hören kann und auch nicht muss. P.S.: Es ergibt keinen Sinn ein totes Pferd weiter zu reiten."
5,"Auch diese CD ist sehr gut und außerdem kann man ja nicht verlangen, dass jedes Album ein Jahrhundertwerk wird wie ""Images And Words"". Sicher sind Stücke wie ""Take Away My Pain"", ""Hollow Years"" oder ""Anna Lee"" ziemlich einfach gestrickt, aber es muss doch nicht immer jeder Song eine Viertelstunde dauern. Außerdem wird das Ganze durch wirklich wunderschöne Refrains und überhaupt herrliche Gesangslinien sozusagen ""relativiert"".  Für den Frickel-Fan gibt es immer noch Stücke wie den vertrackten Opener ""New Millenium"", das geile ""Lines In The Sand"" und vor allem das wunderbar melancholische finale Meisterwerk ""Trial Of Tears"", das ich sogar als einen der besten Dream Theater-Songs überhaupt bezeichnen würde und das ebenfalls durch seine herrlichen Gesangslinien, sowie die tollen Soli im Mittelteil und eine ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond""-Stimmung besticht. Etwas rockiger geht es dann bei ""Burning My Soul"" und dem zugegeben etwas schwächeren ""Just Let Me Breathe"" zu - im Großen und Ganzen ist also für jeden etwas dabei.Ein Wort noch zu Keyboarder Derek Sherenian: Interessanter Stil von ihm, in den man sich sicherlich erst reinhören muss, da er doch ziemlich anders ist als der von Kevin Moore, etwas gewöhnungsbedürftiger."
5,"Eine Warnung vorweg: Um von einer Band wie Dream Theater begeistert sein zu können, muss man entweder schon überzeugter Fan des ProgRock sein oder viel Ausdauer haben: Hören, hören, immer wieder hören. Dies ist keine Musik zum Nebenbei hören, dies ist Musik, die einen komplett in ihren Bann zieht. Und irgendwann ist man an einem Punkt, wo sie sich ins Ohr gefressen hat und man von dem ganzen kommmerziellen Pop-Zeugs sowieso nichts mehr hören will."
5,"Über 20 Jahre bin ich eigentlich dem Thrash-Metal treu gewesen und habe diese CD von Dream Theater eher zufällig kennengelernt. Hatte zwar schon einiges von der Band vom Hören-Sagen gehört, aber nie so richtig den Drang gehabt mir eine CD zu besorgen. Also schon bei den ersten Sekunden dieser Scheibe, war ich begeistert von der absolut genialen Klangqualität und was die Bandmitglieder alles aus ihren Instrumenten rausholen. Richtig coole Gitarren-Riffs, wunderschöne Melodie-Bögen, die eine wahnsinnig aussagekräftige Stimmung erzeugen und glas-klarer Gesang. WIll jetzt nicht jeden einzelnen Song ""auseinandernehmen"". Diese CD als Gesamtkunstwerk ist einfach fantastisch und über eine vernünftige Audio-Anlage das Ticket für eine Reise in eine andere Welt. Freu mich schon darauf, die anderen Werke nach und nach für mich zu entdecken."
2,"...so hat er, der Grossmeister des TranceTechnoBeats Tiesto - wie auf dem erstaunlich kitschigen Cover angezeigt - darüber nachgedacht, wie mit Remixen nochmal Kasse gemacht werden kann mit Altbewährtem.  Auf die Gefahr hin, dass mich die Tiestotiefgläubigen zerreissen mögen, es ist nicht gelungen und es gibt wirklich absolut nichts neues zu lauschen. Einzig innovativ ist der Remix von First State "" Ten Seconds..."" sowie der Airbase Remix ""Elements of live"". Ergibt 2 Sterne. Das war`s. Alles andere zerläuft in den Hörgängen und nichts bleibt haften. Trance-Alltagsware."
1,"Die Filmmusik zu ""The Da Vinci Code"" trägt einen großen Teil dazu bei warum die Kritiker in Cannes, die Fachpresse und ein großer Teil der Kinogänger den Film eher als langweilig und langathmig empfinden. Filmmusik trägt unglaublich viel zur Empfindung eines Filmes bei. Hans Zimmers sich ständig wiederholenden Streicherostinati und immer gleichen Akkorde wirken auf die Dauer einfach ermüdend.  Das schadet leider auch dem eigentlich recht gelungenen Film. Selbst bei den wenigen Actionsequenzen des Films weist die Musik keine Höhepunkte oder Tempoveränderungen auf.  Ich bin Musikstudent und kann so etwas keine Komposition nennen. Bei uns heisst so etwas ""Harmonie- &amp; Satzlehre Übungen"" und jeder Student muss sie im ersten Semester machen."
2,"Die in der Fachpresse gelobte CD weist eine so starke klangliche Unausgewogenheit auf, dass es eigentlich keine Freude ist, sich diese anzuhören. Da tröstet auch die schöne Musik nicht!"
2,"Mit großem Interesse und hohen Erwartungen habe ich mir die neue CD angehört. Leider wurde ich sehr enttäuscht. Diese CD ist nun der beste Beweis dafür, wie schwer es ist Balcanto Arien das richtige gesangliche ""Leben"" einzuhauchen. Dass daran auch eine große Sängerin, die technisch mit perfekten Gesangsmitteln ausgestattet ist, scheitern kann, dokumentiert diese Einspielung. Man kennt C. Bartoli über die letzten Jahre hinweg eigentlich ausschließlich aus dem Barockbereich, in dem Sie mit ihren aberwitzigen Koloraturen beeindrucken konnte. Diese Rechnung geht hier aber nicht auf. C. Bartoli ist m.E. in den meisten Arien nicht in der Lage, die erforderliche Atmosphäre stimmlich zu erzeugen. Das merkt man besonders schmerzlich in der großen Arie der Oper I Puritani. Der melancholische, schwebende Ton Bellinis kann hier nur ansatzweise getroffen werden. Überhaupt hat C. Bartoli enorme Schwierigkeiten mit dem Aussingen großer Bögen. Die Koloraturen wirken oft geradezu hölzern und aus der Gesangslinie herausgelöst. Die Casta Diva Arie gerät daher zu einer einzigen, gehauchten Zumutung. Lediglich die koloraturgespickten Arien ( Hummel; Rossini) bewältigt sie mit der gewohnten Raffinesse und Souveränität. Wobei man auch hier sagen muss, dass C. Bartoli nur zu oft in alte ""Koloraturgewohnheiten"" zurückfällt, die auf Dauer mehr als nerven. Eigentlich hätte ich der Künstlerin eine größere, stimmliche Wandlungsfähigkeit zugetraut. Schade, schade!!"
4,"Ein grossartiger Anfang auf jeden Fall! Polarkreis 18 haben hier eine sehr interessante Platte abgeliefert. Ich bin schon mal darüber erfreut, dass man in den Musikgazetten positiven Kritiken über eine Platte lesen kann, auf der nicht pubertierende Krawallmacher ihre Instrumente quälen und die dann als Britpop verkauft werden soll. Die Musik zieht unaufhörlich vorwärts, mittel- und hochtonlastig erinnert mich das ein wenig an die achtziger Jahre. Würde Depeche Mode heute so klingen? Könnte sein! Die aufeinander folgenden Stücke somedays, sundays"" und crystal lake"" finde ich sehr gut. Es geht dann auch gleich interessant und schmissig weiter. Richtig überzeugend wird die Platte natürlich dann, wenn man bedenkt dass dies ein Debütalbum einer Kapelle aus Dresden ist. Hört, hört so etwas hätte ich von der Insel erwartet, aber nicht aus D. Noch mal comes around"" angehört, ja doch, die Band hat das Zeug uns in Zukunft zu begeistern und zu überraschen. Beim Debüt bleibe ich mal bei vier Sternen, na gut viereinhalb Sterne! Das muss jetzt aber reichen, schliesslich soll die nächste CD ja noch eine Steigerungsmöglichkeit bieten. Ein Geheimtipp ist Polarkreis nicht mehr. Dennoch sollte man die CD kaufen, da sie sehr gut Musik enthält und der Käufer später mit der Erstauflage angeben kann. So im Sinne von Schau mal, die Erstauflage von Polarkreis 18, ich habe ja schon damals das grosse Potential erkannt"""
5,"Das ist jedenfalls Meinung. Every Man For Himself hat keinen Durchhänger. Jeder Song hat seine eigene Faszination und doch harmoniert das ganze Album perfekt.Wie geschrieben man könnte jetzt jeden Song nennen aber trotzdem ein paar Anspieltipps 4. Inside of you : Besitzt eine bombastische Power kommt mal wütend mal auch fröhlich rüber. 5. The first of me : Geniale Harmoniebögen. Bleibt lange ruhig zieht zum Ende hin an. 6. Good Enough : Verkörpert den perfekten Ausgleich zwischen Ruhe in den Strophen und Aggressivität im Refrain mit einer ebenfalls tollen Melodie. 10.Look where We Are : Basiert auf einer tollen E-Gitarrenmelodie und ähnelt vielleicht noch am ehesten dem Sound vom The Reason-Album. 12. If Only: In dieser Ballade stecken derart viele Emotionen, dass man einfach dahinschmelzen muss. Aber ich hätte wirklich jedem einzelnen Titel 5 Sterne gegeben!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"Das ist ein Album wie es im Buche steht: tolle Melodien, super Stimme, Abwechslung und perfekt aufgenommen mit vielen ""richtigen"" Künstlern und Musikern! Und die Aufmachung der Cd, des Booklets sind auch klasse. Jedes Lied ein Genuss zwischen Pop, Klassik, Orient und New Age! Kurz gesagt: Der Wahnsinn. 5 oder mehr Sterne! (Zum vorherigen Rezensenten: was hat das mit Oliver Shanti oder Schiller zu tun, ""Ein schöner Tag"" war schon gecovert und zwar von Puccini!!)"
1,"Wertes Amazon-Team, wenn es Ihnen nicht gelingt, diesen Unsinn/diese Unsitte von Wichtigtuern zu beenden, die glauben ein Album nach einem bekannten Song bewerten zu müssen, können Sie Ihr ganzes Rezensionssystem vergessen - und dann auch mich als Kunden, denn dann ist das alles völlig wertlos!!!"
1,"Schade, dass The Killers die im zweiten Album nur noch wenig vorhandenen guten Ansätze nun völlig aus Ihrer Musik verbannt haben und sich entschieden, nur noch belanglose, langeweilige und konsumorientierte Musik zu machen. Dieses Album ist genauso bunt und unecht wie Las Vegas.  Schade. Fehlkauf. Das nächste Album kommt nicht in meine Wohnung."
5,"Weihnachten, das zweit aktuellste Thema für jeden Sänger nach Liebe. Celine Dion macht aus bekannten Weihnachtsliedern Songs zum Immerwiederanhören - es sind auch neue Lieder dabei, die ebenfalls wunderbar sind. Sehr kreativ von den Produzenten, dass sie manche Lieder zweisprachig machen (Ave Maria, Brahm's Lullabye...) Und das tollste an der CD ist: Man kann ihre Lieder auch unter dem Jahr anhören!!!"
5,"This compilation includes many of Dusty's sixties hits, plus some of her eighties comeback hits. However, it does not include any of her Springfield hits (Island of dreams in the UK, Silver threads and golden needles in the USA), nor does it include any of her seventies music, so it cannot be described as a career-spanning retrospective."
2,"Achherjehchen! Nun hat man die gaaanz alten Sachen von KS rausgekramt und bringt auch diese an den Mann; die hartnäckigen Fans werden es lieben. Natürlich kann man dafür nicht heutige Maßstäbe ansetzen. Wer jedoch meint die Entwicklung von KS nachvollziehen zu müssen, liegt hier  richtig. Interessanterweise hört man hier schon viel von dem, was auf späteren Alben immer wieder erscheint, ähem. Der Booklettext ist etwas daneben und überflüssig. Ideal für KS-Fans die sich gern in alten Sachen suhlen bzw. sich den alten Zeitgeist erhalten wollen."
2,"Musikalisch ist hier nicht viel los. Ein Lied beginnt, und bleibt bis zum Ende auf einer sehr unterspannten Ebene, was bei 20-Minuten-Tracks etwas heftig ist, sofern man nicht einfach wegdämmert.  Harmonisch, bzw. melodisch passiert fast gar nichts. Dies emotionalisiert nicht, was besonders schade ist, da Gerrards Stimme eigentlich genau dazu gemacht scheint. Dafür ergeht sich Lisa Gerrard in uninspirierten Improvisationen, welche letztlich fast nur aus Bruchstücken von bereits existierenden Liedern (Stimmungen) der Gerrard betstehen. Aber auf diese seichte Musik, ohne Anfang, Mitte und Ende (ohne jegliche musikalische Dramaturgie), hätte z.B. auch eine Sainkho so ihre Probleme gehabt, da bin ich sicher."
1,"Ich besitze das Album Virtuoso von David Garrett. Ich höre es ganz gerne, weil ich sein Spiel mag und versuche, den Rest auszublenden. Auch wenn mich zwei, drei Stücke derart durch ihre schlechte Aufbereitung nerven, dass ich sie überspringe. David Garrett ist ohne Zweifel ein unglaublich großes Talent und er ist mir, seitdem ich in bei ""Zimmer frei"" gesehen habe, sehr sympathisch (sein gutes Aussehen erfreut natürlich auch ;)) Ich liebe gute klassische Musik, sie ist Balsam für die Seele. Dasselbe gilt für gute Popmusik, der ich mich keinesfalls verweigere. Nur was ich eben in den Hörproben wahrgenommen habe, ist teilweise erschreckend untauglich, die Ohren zu erfreuen. Weder entspannend noch anregend. Eine Zusammenführung von Klassik und Pop mag gelingen, in diesem Fall ist sie es kaum. Und Menschen, die keine klassische Musik mögen oder schwer Zugang zu ihr finden, werden dadurch eher verschreckt Abstand halten. David ist so ein phantastischer Violinist und ich liebe sein Spiel! Gefühlvoll und zum dahinschmelzen! Aber bitte ohne Bum-cha-cha oder Krach im Hintergrund!"
1,"Um es in einem Wort zusammenzufassen: schade. Nicht, dass wir viel von dieser CD erwartet hätten, aber das Gebotene ist einfach unter aller Sau. Statt Naturgeräuschen - wie der Titel suggeriert - bekommt man lediglich träge (nicht einmal gut abgemischte, da zu laute) Gitarren-Klampferei, ein langweilig geblasenes Saxophon und eine stellenweise aufdringlich reinplärrende Trompete zu hören. Die Melodien erinnern an längst vergangene Schlager. Von Meeresgeräuschen keine Spur, die gehen in diesem Crescendo einfach unter. Man hätte einfach nur ein gutes Mikrofon an einem Strand aufstellen und die Brandung aufzeichnen sollen..."
5,"Zu dem Album als solches muss ich mich ja nicht mehr großartig äussern. Das '72er Werk von Wishbone Ash gehört sicher zum Besten, was die Musikgeschichte je hervorgebracht hat. Wichtig in diesem Falle ist dann doch mal der Klang. Was die Tontechniker jetzt bei der Wiederaufbereitung der Masterbänder geleistet haben ist durchaus bemerkenswert. Man muss sich zum Vergleich nur mal die original MCA CD Pressung anhören. Selbst die japanische Pressung aus der ''Papersleeve Collection'' klingt um Längen schlechter. Wer also ''Argus'' in der ultimativen Version haben möchte, kommt um diese Veröffentlichung nicht herum. Die zweite CD (BBC Live) ist übrigens auch hörenswert."
2,"Da wird doch noch fix versucht aus dem überraschenden(?) Ende der Engel ein paar Monetas abzuschröpfen. Stellt sich die berechtigte Frage nach der Legitimation einer Greatest Hits CD nach zwei jähriger Bandpräsenz ?!? Das braucht doch eigentlich kein Mensch, oder ? Aber sei's drum. Sie waren schließlich die ersten auf dem Markt, bevor der unsägliche Castingwahn los ging und waren auch für den ein oder anderen netten Popsong gut. Insofern dann doch zwei Sterne für eine ansonsten ziemlich überflüssige Compilation.  Ich warte jedoch lieber auf die Greatest Hits von Bro'Sis, dann hoffentlich auch mit allen B-Seiten, Remixen und raren unveröffentlichten Songs... das wird bestimmt spannend. Mit etwas Glück spring ne ganze EP bei raus..."
5,"Ich habe das Video das erste mal bei VIVA im Fernsehen gesehen und war mehr als begeistert. Ich habe mir sofort diese CD dann hier bei Amazon bestellt. Ich muss euch sagen einfach nur der Hammer, sogar das video ist auf der Maxi Cd mit drauf und so kann ich jederzeit von meinen Laptop mir das Video wann immer ich will anschauen. Ich bin gespannt was noch alle von Eisblume kommen wird. Für mich persönlich ist sie (Eisblume) der beste Newcomer seit langem. Vor mir gibt es hier 5 ***  und mehr. Ich kann diese CD nur Empfehlen und euch raten diese zu Kaufen. Lieben Gruss Rene"
2,"...bis auf die ersten drei lieder (welche wirklich ganz toll sind) is, zumindest für mich, nix hörenswertes mehr dabei... 4 - 6 sind stinknormal, fast schon langweilig. 7 - 9 sind mittelprächtig, 10 - 12 sind mariah carey-mäßig (also auch nicht so das wahre) und 13 versinkt im absoluten schmalz... aber die stimme ist toll :-)"
5,"""White Ladder"" ist eines von wenigen Alben, welches bereits nach dem ersten Mal hören einen Eingang direkt ins Herz gefunden hat. Die Schönheit dieser Musik hat sich sofort erschlossen - und es war sozusagen ""Liebe auf den ersten Ton"". ""White Ladder"" ist mir in einer Phase von grossen Liebeskummer ""über den Weg gelaufen"" und ich habe mich in den Texten wiedergefunden, Trost und Verständnis und auch Hoffnung gefunden. Für mich jetzt schon ein Album für die Ewigkeit - gehört zu meinen persönlichen Top-Ten und wird da wohl auch bleiben!!!!"
2,"Schämen sich die Verantwortlichen nicht, so eine Kompilation, die bereits 2003 mit den exakt gleichen Titeln, in der exakt gleichen Reihenfolge und nahezu gleichem Cover veröffentlicht wurde, nun aus Anlass des 80. Geburtstages von James (HANSI) Last als sogenannte ""Geburtstags-Edition"" auf den Markt zu bringen? Abgesehen davon, daß alle Titel dieser CD schon ""hundertmal"" auf anderen Kompilationen erschienen sind, hätte man doch nun wirklich etwas vollkommen Neues dieses grossartigen Künstlers und Menschen (!) herausbringen können; eine CD-Box z.B., die das musikalische Lebenswerk streift, auch nur streifen kann, da er bekanntlich ein unerschöpfliches Repertoire eingespielt hat. Dies wäre wirklich angemessen gewesen. Aber anscheinend wurde hier (mal wieder!) getreu dem Motto gehandelt: Der Mohr hat seine Schuldigkeit getan, der Mohr kann geh'n!"" Schade! Oder sollte man sagen: Schande?!"" (Günter Krüger, Berlin)"
5,"...so denken sicher viele. kannte PK nur von seniorenabendähnlichen fernsehauftritten an die man zwangsläufig mal gerät um gleich wieder weiterzuschalten. an diese produktion bin ich also eher zufällig geraten, weil ich mich nach ""toots"" thielemann, dem harmonikavirtuosen umgesehen habe und dann gleich noch ein anderes mal, als ich so herumscrollte um zu sehen, was es von greetje kauffeld so alles gibt. die anderen mitmusiker sagten mir nichts und trotzdem regte sich ein verlangen, eine vermutung: ""hey, das könnte gut sein!"" ...war es/ist es!!! sehr gut sogar !!! wer entspannten, erstklassigen piano-jazz sucht, wer sich an einem pointierten ""sugar daddy"" erfreuen kann, wer swing und groonende songs liebt, wer bluesigen mundharmonikasolis etwas abgewinnen kann und sich von allen vorurteilen betreffend paul kuhn befreien will: dies ist DIE scheibe für euch - egal ob konzentriert gehört oder nebenbei geplätschert! abgesehen von der höchst vergnüglichen darbietung ist auch noch der sound vom feinsten, audiophil nachgerade, auch dafür fünf sterne ohne wenn und aber!"
1,"Das kann ich ihnen sagen: Um Leute zu ködern, die sich die erste Version von 2004 gekauft haben und deren CD-Spieler aufgrund des Kopierschutzes nicht in der Lage war, die CD korrekt wiederzugeben. Daher habe auch ich diese CD in der Hoffnung gekauft, endlich in den ungetrübten Hörgenuss der `BiPolar zu kommen. Doch was musste ich feststellen: Der Hersteller hatte einfach eine andersartige Papphülle über die selbe 2004 Version geschoben und dann als neues Release ausgegeben. Da komme ich mir kurz gesagt über den Tisch gezogen vor.  Mein Tipp: Die Scheibe  Bi Polar ist wirklich sehr gut. Aber wenn sie bereits die 2004er Version besitzen: Finger weg von dieser Mogelpackung, die sich klangtechnisch in keinster Weise von der alten Version unterscheidet (die bei mir 5 Sterne bekommen hat)."
2,"Es deutete sich ja bereits seit Längerem an: Die PMG hat ein zunehmendes Problem, die musikalische Emotionalität vergangener glorreicher Zeiten zu wiederholen. Und mit jedem neuen Tonträger hofft man ein wenig mehr auf das Wunder, die Band könnte noch einmal die Qualität der Alben ""Still Life Talking"", ""The First Circle"" oder ""Letter From Home"" erreichen - um nur ein paar der vielen überragenden Werke zu nennen. Leider wird diese Hoffnung aber enttäuscht. ""The Way Up"" ist ein künstliches Werk (und kein Kunstwerk), das als Konzeptalbum die Perfektion der Arrangements und der Technik in den Vordergrund stellt. Und zwar so sehr, dass der Hörer staunend und tief beeindruckt ob der unglaublichen musikintellektuellen virtuosen Möglichkeiten der Band zurückbleibt. Aber das, was gute Musik wirklich ausmacht, fehlt fast vollständig: Gefühl. Es fehlen die intuitiven Melodien, vormals Pat Methenys ganz große Stärke. Melodien, die trotz ihrer Komplexität vom Hörer schon bald mitgesungen werden können. Es fehlen die zwar oft überraschenden, aber stets homogen wirkenden Harmoniewechsel. Und es fehlt - ganz allgemein - Wärme. Selbst die ruhigen Stellen sind kalt wie Eis. Und das ist wahrscheinlich das größte Manko der PMG. Ihre Musik ist nicht mehr Ausdruck bestimmter Stimmungen. Ihre Musik ist am Reisbrett entworfen, sie ist das Ergebnis der Fähigkeiten, nicht der Ideen. Vielleicht ist der Kreativspeicher eines der größten Komponisten unserer Zeit einfach leer. Ich gebe dennoch zwei Sterne, weil die intellektuelle Leistung bei aller Kritik beeindruckend ist."
2,"... genau diesen Eindruck bekomme ich beim Hören dieses Albums. Vieles wirkt wie eine Zweitverwertung von Ideen, die es aus gutem Grund nicht auf eine seiner anderen Alben geschafft haben. Wie schade! Der Kick beim Hören stellt sich nicht ein, alles ist sauber, aber sehr inspirationslos - beinahe möchte ich sagen heruntergespielt. Es fehlt das Feuer der früheren Werke. Zur Erholung gönne ich mir jetzt ""Surfing with the alien"" in der Special-Version mit der DVD von Satchs Auftritt beim Jazz-Festival (!!) in Montreux 1988. Da war noch Dampf drin - hier leider nicht mehr. Eine CD, die man absolut nicht haben muß."
5,"Ich kann diese CD uneingeschränkt empfehlen! Hören und geniessen...;-) Ist schon verdammt grass, wenn diese alten Ikonen Ihre Musik spielen! That`s real Blues Music !!"
5,"Mit Verzücken lausche ich Earthquake und kann's noch immer nicht glauben dass Beck, der eigentlich schon sämtliche Grenzen mehrfach überschritten hat, neues Terrain erobert. Der Meister versteht halt noch immer zu überraschen und wird das sicher auch in Zukunft so handhaben. Jemand der sich über mehrere Jahrzehnte im Stil ständig weiterentwickelt und nicht wie viele andere stehen bleibt verdient tiefen Respekt."
5,"Pünktlich zu Keith Jarretts 60. Geburtstag kommt das Album auf das alle seine Fans gewartet haben. »Radiance« ist die erste Soloplatte Keith Jarretts seit der sehr erfolgreichen Veröffentlichung von »The Melody At Night With You« vor nunmehr sechs Jahren. Sie ist außerdem die erste Aufnahme mit Solo-Piano Improvisationen seit »La Scala« von 1995. »Radiance« steht für all das, womit Keith Jarrett jenen Status erreichte, der ihn als einen der größten zeitgenössischen Jazzmusiker etablierte. »Radiance« schafft jene Magie, die man mit dem legendären »Köln Concert« assoziert. Melodische, lyrische Passagen mit ausladenen und offenen Harmonien, wechseln mit Passagen höchster Energie und großes Intensität, bei denen man sich den Meister sogleich bildlich am Flügel vorstellen kann."
4,"Ich muss zugeben, nach dem ersten Hören von ""Highway Companion"" war ich enttäuscht. Angefüttert durch ""Saving Grace"", ""Square One"", ""Flirting with Time"" und ""Big Weekend"", konnte ich meine Vorfreude kaum in Grenzen halten. Jedoch wurden die hohen Erwartungen nicht ganz eingelöst. Aber erst mal das Positive. Jeder einzelne Song auf diesem Silberling ist gut bis brillant. Einzige Ausnahme bildet ""Damaged by Love"", das für meinen Geschmack lahm und zu eintönig ist. Bei den anderen Songs geht es indes stilistisch recht abwechslungsreich zu. Bluesiger Rockabilly, California-Rock, etwas Traveling Wilburys, eine gute Prise George Harrison, die Beatles und Bob Dylan sind mehr oder minder deutlich herauszuhören. Letzterer insbesondere bei ""Down South"", das wie die Coverversion eines unveröffentlichten Liedes von Bob Dylans ""Love &amp; Theft""-Album klingt. Als 'dylanesk"" kann man auch einige der augenzwinkernden Lyrics bezeichnen. In der Tat verblüffend für Herrn Petty sind die im Song ""Jack"" wiederzufindenden Anklänge an Tito &amp; Tarantula.  Der Qualität der einzelnen Songs zum Trotz fehlt dem Album jedoch das gewisse Etwas, nämlich eine spannungsreiche Dramaturgie. Zwar sind die Lieder stilistisch unterschiedlich, kommen im Gros aber im gleichen Tempo daher. Ausnahmen bilden ""Saving Grace"" ""Flirting with Time"" und ""Big Weekend"", die mit Schwung den Hörer zu einem erhöhten Fußwippen oder gar durch-die-Wohnung-Schunkeln veranlassen. Selbst bei ""Turn This Car Around"" ist es der energetische Mittelteil, der dem Song seine ganze Genialität verleiht. Auch wird hier Pettys über weite Strecken eher säuselnder Vortrag durch eine kraftvolle Gesangsstimme abgewechselt. ""Highway Companion"" kommt insgesamt zu gemächlich daher. Man möchte zwar keinen einzigen Song missen (außer vielleicht dem bereits erwähnten ""Damaged by Love""), aber hätten der Langrille noch zwei Up-Tempo-Stücke gut getan, die noch etwas Pfeffer ins Gemisch brächten. Das ist es nämlich auch, was Pettys andere Soloalben ""Full Moon Fever"" und ""Wildflowers"" neben den einzelnen Hammersongs so herausragend machte, die Dramaturgie in der Abfolge und Kombination der Lieder. Es ist einfach cool, wie auf ""Full Moon Fever"" das Schlaflied (jetzt im positiven Sinne) ""Alright For Now"" zwischen den beiden Party-Songs ""Apartment Song"" und ""A Mind With a Heart of Its Own"" steht oder auf ""Wildflowers"" das herrlich minimalistische ""Don't Fade on Me"" auf das furios rockende ""Honey Bee"" folgt. Gerade diese Spannung zwischen laut und leise, langsam und schnell ist es, was ""Highway Companion"" fehlt. Von diesem Makel bleiben die Songs selbst natürlich unberührt, und nach mehrmaligem Hören geht diese Platte auch auf wie eine knospende Blüte (kitschiges Bild, ich weiß). Dennoch bewahrheitet sich wieder die alte Weisheit: Das Ganze ist mehr als die Summe seiner Teile. Das gilt leider auch für solche genialen Songwriter wie Tom Petty."
4,"Mit Wildflowers ist Tom Petty eine wirklich wundervolle Platte geglückt, die von ruhigen Balladen wie ""It`s good to be king"" bis hin zu rockigeren Stücken wie ""Cabin down below"" das Hörerherz erfreuen kann. Unspektakulär, altmodisch und gerade deshalb so gut."
2,"Dass Mark Knopfler seit dem Split der Dire Straits nicht mehr den Rocker raushängen lässt, ist bekannt. Aber hier lässt er es doch entschieden zu ruhig, ja verschlafen, angehen. Das macht das Zuhören regelrecht zur Qual - daran können weder sein grundsätzlich brillantes Gitarrenspiel - wenn er es denn zum Einsatz kommen lässt - noch die durchweg anspruchsvollen, teilweise ironisch-sarkastischen Texte etwas ändern. Anscheinend nützen die besten handwerklichen Fähigkeiten nichts, wenn der Songschreiber Knopfler in ein kreatives Loch fällt! Schade, denn soeben hat er als Gastmusiker beim neuen John Fogerty-Album bewiesen, dass er es auch noch anders kann. Aber da brauchte er sich auch nur zu einer Fogerty-Komposition auszutoben!"
5,"Baz Luhrmann ist der wagemutigste und brillianteste Regisseur Hollywoods. Schon ""Romeo &amp; Juliet"" war aufgrund seiner Mixtur aus  Shakespearean english with american accent, Hawaiihemden, polierten Pistolenläufen und Songs von ""Nine Inch Nails"" bis ""DesRee"" ein Geniestreich.  ""Moulin Rouge"" setzt noch einen drauf. Die Ausstattung ist an Opulenz nicht zu überbieten. Dass die Can Can Girls zu Fatboy Slim tanzen ist genauso wenig verwunderlich wie die Tangoversion von Police's ""Roxanne"". Alles dreht sich, alles bewegt sich. Der Kinosessel wird zum Roller Coaster. Ewan McGregor und Nicole Kidman singen sich quer durch die Popgechichte. ""Lady Marmalade"" hatte nie soviel Dampf und Diamanten waren dank Nicole noch nie so wertvoll wie heute. Kurz: am Sonntagvormittag den Soundtrack hören, mindestens zweimal in den Film gehen und die Welt ist in Ordnung."
1,"Als ich die CD das erste Mal hörte berührte mich die Musik bis auf ""To many Cooks"" und ""Memo from Turner"" nicht. Das liegt aber nicht an der Musik, sondern an der schlampigen digitalen Überspielung. Der Rhytmus, der Groove die Klangfarben sind völlig weg. Ich habe zum Vergleich dann die Original CDs ""Wandering Spirit"" und ""Primitive Cool"" aus dem Regal geholt und die Songs gefielen mir wieder und der gewohnte gute Sound war wieder da ! Der Sound auf dieser CD erinnert mich stark an flach klingende MP3 Copien...echt eine Schande für die Musik. Die Bonus DVD ist ok die CD lohnt sich wegen der schlechten digitalen Überspielung nicht."
5,"...! Nach ihrer kurzen Pause startet sie wieder voll durch! Neue Single, die sich echt hören lässt. Gewohnt gute Gitarrenklänge mit ihrer Stimme vereint, ein super Ohrwurm!"
2,"Nach den Lobeshymmen der untenstehenden Rezensenten konnte ich mich nicht dagegen wehren in diese CD hineinzuhören.  Meinem Empfinden nach besitzt die Stimme Gäbels sehr viel Parallelität mit der des unvergessenen Frank Sinatra. Das wäre keinesfalls negativ aufzufassen.  Was mir missfiel, war die nicht vorhandene Innovation auf dieser Platte. Keine großartigen Arrangements, die Songs in der Mehrzahl eher zum Fahrstuhl fahren gedacht.  Mir hat die Leichtigkeit, das Freche und das Erfrischende Moment in vielen Songs gefehlt, die beispielsweise Bublé und Olstead an den Tag legen.  Das war einfach zu wenig!"
5,"Zuerst mal will ich eine kleine Enttäuschung vorweg nehmen: Das Trio aus Portland hat sich für das zweite Album produzieren lassen. Der Vierspur-Krach ist also weg, aber es gibt definitiv keinen Grund, diesem Gerumpel und Gezische nachzutrauern. Denn was The Thermals auf ""Fuckin A"" vorlegen, ist so brilliant, dass mir persönlich nach den 30 Minuten die Spucke wegblieb. Es gibt auf dieser Platte Songs, die in zwei Minuten so viele Hooks abfeuern, dass einem schwindelig wird. ""A Stare Like Yours"" zum Beispiel: Sänger Hutch Harris haut die Lyrics raus, als wolle er die Band überrunden. Doch Kathy Foster (Bass) und Jordan Hudson (Drums) denken gar nicht daran, ihren Frontmann entkommen zu lassen. Racing-Garage-Pop. Und der Überhit ""Keep Time"" steigert noch einmal alle Rundenrekorde. Der grandiose Trubel kommt dabei in einer Qualität aus den Boxen, die man im Nachhinein auch dem Debüt gewünscht hätte. Wo es damals schepperte (1.Album: More Parts per Million- Anspieltipp: ""ItŽs Trivia"" und ""Brace And Break"") , ist jetzt der Druck und das Gefühl da, direkt daneben zu stehen, wenn The Thermals im Handstreich die sich demnächst auflösende Legende Guided By Voices beerben. Einige werden es schade finden, dass der Spaß nach gut einer halben Stunde vorbei ist. Ich sage: Gut so, denn wie soll man dieses Hit-Tempo länger durchhalten? Also, klare Kaufempfehlung!!"
5,"Die ""Show Of Hands"" von 1989 wurde auf der ""Power Windows""- Tour und der ""Hold The Fire""- Tour aufgenommen und ist ... perfekt! Einfach phantastisch, was die 3 hier abziehen. Das Album bietet einen phantastischen Überblick der 80er-Jahre Alben dieser Ausnahmeband. Für mich war es die beste Phase der Kanadier. Anspieltipps kann ich beim besten Willen nicht abgeben, da a l l e Songs einfach genial sind und teilweise noch besser als die Studioversionen. 5 Sterne für die Show von Rush."
1,"Ich verstehe es einfach nicht, dass man hierzulande immer noch Musik kauft, die sich seit den 80er Jahren nicht weiterentwickelt hat mit Texten, bei denen es sich einem, der halbwegs Englisch versteht, die Fußnägel zusammenrollen, und diesem unsäglichen selbsternannten ""Musikgenie"" Dieter Bohlen das Geld in den Hals steckt.  Schade für Daniel, aber er hätte bei der Auswahl seines Songschreibers und Plattenproduzenten auch ""nein"" sagen können. Jetzt wird er wohl den Bohlen-Stempel für immer tragen müssen, der noch weit schlimmer und einprägsamer ist als der DSDS-Stempel."
5,"Was hatt Bitte Character und Auftreten mit der Musik zutun?Egal Ob Man Zeit meines Lebens mag oder nicht,als erstes schaut man auf den Künstler!Das Begreife ich einfach nicht!Ich muss erlich gestehen,dass ich Martin zur DSDS zeiten Überhaupt nicht mochte.Das Hatte aber ÜBERHAUPT nichts mit Ihm als Person zutun gehabt,er ist ja ein netter Symphatischer und süßer Typ Klar,aber seine Stimme hatt mich nicht Überzeugt.Und wen ich mir dieses Lied anhöre (was schon seit Tagen rauf und runter gespielt wird)fällt mir eins auf: Er hat sich enorm Entwickelt! Das ist recht Lobenswert.Und dan mansche Negativen Tezensionen,machen mich Wahnsinnig.Wie kan man Nur so geschmacklos sein?Warum Trampeln solche Menschen Immer nur auf Casting Stars rum?Ich finde das Lied Lobenswert besser als von Lisa Bund Mark Medlock Oder dne Leeren Müll. Mansche Menschen Mögen ihn nicht,toll.Super,aber warum Trampeln sie auf ihn rum?er ist ein Junger Talentiertre und äusserst Symphatischer Junge,der doch etwas kann.Nur mansche wollen es nicht wahrhaben,dass er dass ganz gut schaffen kann,in der Musik Branche.Auch Ohne Bohlen! Und da muss man noch was sagen,Martin stosch Hat bei diesem Lied mitgeschrieben..Lobenswert.Für seine 17! Und wen Ich dan solche Rezensionen lese wie ""Das war ein Flopp,neu einstieg auf Platz 30"" Da muss ich echt nur Kopfschütteln und denken ""Was denken solche Leute eigentlich Immer ?Es ist kein Zucker schlecken in der Musik Branche"".Und wen man bednekt,dass er 70 Super Künstler hinter sich gelassen hat,dan ist es ein Riesen Erfolg.Vorallem weil er eine Kleine Plattenfirma hat,und auch nicht wirklich viel Promo bekommen hatte.Alle achtung Martin! Ich wünsche Ihm sehr Viel Glück,den talent hat er!"
2,"Also, jetzt muss ich mich hier wirklich auch noch mal zu Wort melden. Ich weiß nicht, ob hier alle irgendein anderes Lied gehört haben, aber der Song von Linda ist einfach nur platt, und richtig schlecht, das zumindest empfinde ich so! Das ist so Schade, denn Linda hatte eine tolle Stimme, von der man auf diesem Machwerk auch nicht viel mitkriegt. Was hat sich wer bei diesem Teil gedacht? Meines Erachtens: Null Chance auf die Charts, das wird nix, und das was dann leider auch mit der Karriere...."
1,"...ich konnte vorab schon einmal reinhören in die CD. Und es ist genau das bei raus gekommen was man erwarten konnte. Bohlen hat Songs am FLießband geschrieben und so klingts dann ja auch. Modern Talking mäßig, nur noch seichter!!!"
1,"Was will man erwarten oder besser womit muß man rechnen, wenn sich 11 erfolgshungrige Menschen auf den Rattenfänger einlassen und benebelt von ihren Sehnsüchten nicht wahrhaben wollen, daß sie nichts weiter als Stimmvolk auf Zeit sind."
1,"Natürlich hat Nik P. den Song zuerst aufgenommen, soweit ich weiß sogar selber geschrieben. ABER, genau ist jetzt ja das Schreckliche. Nic tinglet seit über einem Jahr mit seinem Cover durch die Tanzpaläste und über Mallorca, und machte den Titel zum Hit. Und nun??? Da kommt der Ötzi ins Gespräch, verschandelt mit seiner Interpretation meiner Meinung nach den ganzen Titel, und Nik P. lässt sich darauf ein. Da kann doch wirklich nur die Gier nach dem schnellen Euro dahinterstecken. Und natürlich knallt diese Version auf Platz 3 der deutschen Charts, während Nic auf Platz 18 angelangt ist. Ich hoffe nur, daß Qualität sich durchsetzen wird, und Nic im Endeffekt der Sieger sein wird. Wenn man eine weitere gute Version von ""Einem Stern"" hören will, dann bitte die Originalversion von Nik P. Denn die hat Herz."
1,"Och wie süss. Deutschland hat einen neuen ""Newcomer"" oder doch besser ""One-Hit-Wonder"", der über Engel singt und pubertärenden Teenis den Liebeskummer erleichtern will.  Für mich persönlich ist es ein ganz schlechter Song, überhaupt gar nicht einfallsreich, magere Lyrics und keine Klangmelodien.  Unverständlich, dass der Song mal auf Platz 2 der Deutschen Verkaufscharts war.  1 Stern gibt es für die Background-Sängerin."
4,"Dies ist wieder mal ein Album was Mrs. Federline (mal gespannt wie lange noch) helfen sollte Ihrem alten Image wegzukommen! Naja - mit manchen Lieder dürfte Ihr das vielleicht geglückt sein! Ein sehr abwechselungs reiches Album, mit Elementen aus HIP-HOP, SIMPLY POP und einen geilen Duet mit der Queen of Pop - wobei ich sagen muss, dass es für mich ""stärkere"" Stücke auf der CD gibt... Zum Beispiel: Shadow oder Breathe HÖREN HÖREN HÖREN........ Ist für (fast) alle Altersgruppen was die mehr auf den gängigen Popsound stehen und auch wo die Sängerin stimmlich keinerlei Höchstleistungen a' Whitney oder Mariah erreichen muss... :-)"
4,"Nach einem Jahr voller Skandale und einem genialen Blackout-Album war ich als Britney Spears Fan natürlich sehr gespannt auf das neue Album Circus. Ich kann gleich zu Beginn sagen: Leider haben sich meine Erwartungen nicht ganz erfüllt. Circus ist meiner Meinung nach nicht so eingängig wie Blackout, man muss jedoch zugeben, dass sich hier die verschiedensten Musikstyle zusammengefunden haben, so dass das Album auf keinen Fall langweilig wird. Doch hier nun im Einzelnen: Womanizer 9,5 / 10: Die erste Single ist ein wirklich geiler und sexy Dance-Track mit einer eingängigen Melodie, bei der man einfach nicht stillsitzen kann! Leider wird das Wort ""Womanizer"" sehr oft wiederholt, was die Gefahr birgt, dass der Song auf die Dauer etwas langweilig werden kann. Ich kann davon jedoch nicht genug bekommen. ;-) Circus 10 / 10: Die zweite Single Circus ist auf jeden Fall eines der besten Lieder des ganzen Albums! Die Strophen sind zwar an sich etwas ruhiger, jedoch ist der Refrain einfach nur super! Ebenfalls sehr toll finde ich die Bridge in der Mitte des Songs. Auch der Text ist sehr autobiografisch. Zusammengefasst kann man sagen: Eines der besten Lieder ihrer 10-jährigen Karriere! Out from under 8 / 10: Die erste Ballade des Albums mit einer sehr schönen, ruhigen Melodie, die zum Träumen einlädt, wobei der Text leider etwas traurig ist, was dem ganzen aber eine gewisse Dramatik verleiht.  Kill the lights 9,5 / 10: Piece of me Teil 2. Sehr elektronisch, aber trotzdem einfach nur geil! ;-)  Wieder ein toller Dance-Track, der es auch verdienen würde, eine Single zu werden. Shattered glass 9 / 10: Dieser Pop-Song, der ein bisschen mehr an die alte Britney erinnert, hat einen sehr speziellen Anfang sowie auch ein spezielles Ende, finde ich aber sehr schön. Allgemein ist der Song etwas ruhiger und vielleicht auch etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig, vor allem der Refrain, nach einiger Zeit verliebt man sich aber auch in diesen Song. If U seek Amy 10 / 10: Und ich würde am liebsten noch mehr Punkte vergeben! Ein Pop-Song höchster Klasse von Max Martin (Baby one more time, Oops! I did it again...), bei dem allen Britney Fans das Herz aufgehen müsste! Man muss einfach aufspringen, tanzen und mitsingen! Außerdem finde ich das Wortspiel des Titels einfach nur genial! ;-) Ihr bester Song überhaupt! Ich bin begeistert! Unusual you 7 / 10: Die zweite Ballade des Albums hat auch eine recht schöne Melodie, nur leider finde ich den Song alles in allem etwas langweilig.  Blur 6 / 10: Erinnert ein wenig an Early Mornin von In The  Zone. Den Text finde ich nicht schlecht, insgesamt ist der Song aber leider eher langweilig. Schade, da hätte man mehr draus machen können. Mmmm Papi 7 / 10: Mit diesem Pop-Song konnte ich am Anfang gar nichts anfangen, da er doch recht eigenwillig ist. Nach einiger Zeit gewöhnt man sich jedoch daran, und dann verbreitet er wirklich gute Laune. ;-) Mannequin 7 /  10: Wieder ein sehr elektronischer Dance-Track, der mehr auf die Musik als auf den Gesang abzielt. Letzterer ist ziemlich schnell und durcheinander. Ein sehr eigener Song, der bestimmt viele Gegner, aber auch genauso viele Befürworter finden wird.  Lace and Leather 8,5 / 10: Erinnert ein wenig an 80er Jahre Pop alla Madonna, ist alles in allem etwas ruhiger, geht aber trotzdem ins Ohr. My Baby 7 / 10: Die letzte Ballade ist ihren Kindern gewidmet, was ich äußerst rührend finde. Vom musikalischen her ist sie leider etwas langweilig, erinnert ein wenig an Someday (I will understand).  Radar 9 / 10: Was dieser Song hier verloren hat, weiß wohl keiner so genau. Er ist auch schon auf Blackout vorhanden und sollte ursprünglich die vierte Single werden, wovon man aber doch abgesehen hat, um die ""düstere"" Blackout-Ära zu beenden. In einigen Ländern ist er jedoch als Promo erschienen, vielleicht ist dies der Grund, warum man ihn hier als Bonustrack genommen hat. Mal davon abgesehen ist es aber ein sehr geiler Dance-Track.  Wie man sehen kann, flaut das Album ab der Hälfte leider etwas ab. Alles in allem kann man jedoch sagen, dass sie ein solides, abwechslungsreiches Pop-Album mit Dance-Tracks und Balladen veröffentlicht hat, dass ich jedem Liebhaber dieser Musikrichtung nur empfehlen kann. Es geht wieder bergauf..."
5,"""Britney"" ist echt ein geniales Pop-Album! 15 durchweg hitverdächtige Tracks, die perfekt produziert sind und in denen Britneys schöne Stimme richtig zum Ausdruck kommt. Hier alle Songs im Überblick: 1.) ""I'm A Slave 4 U"" (10/10) - Britney mal ganz anders! Ein richtiger R'n'B/Dance-Song, der wirklich nichts mehr mit Pop-Liedern wie ""... Baby One More Time"" oder ""Oops! ... I Did It Again"" zu tun hat. Gewöhnungsbedürftig, aber trotzdem sehr gut!"
1,"Cascada - man findet sie gut oder schlecht. Ich für meinen Fall finde diese Version des Hits nicht gelungen. Cascadas dünnes Stimmchen ist nicht für den Song gedacht. Wenn man an die Versionen von Rascal Flatts oder Jo O Meara denkt, dann komtm Freude auf. Aber diese Version ist eher ein Abtörner. Sorry, der Song an sich ist super. Aber in dieser Version schrecklich."
1,"Lieber Alex C - was ist bloss aus Dir geworden; wo die Zeiten als Du als U96 noch mit ""Das Boot"" Technogeschichte geschrieben hast? Was für ein Tiefpunkt!"
4,"Als ich mir dieses Album gekauft habe, war es eher spontan. Ich mag den Stil der GC-Songs und war deshalb vom Album eher positiv überrascht. Songs wie ""Summer Rain"", ""21st Century Digital Girl"" und ""Holy Virgin"" natürlich total im GC-Style, aber auch langsame Songs wie ""When love lives in heaven"" und den bei mir besonders beliebtem Track ""November Night"" beweisen, dass man dieses Album nicht als typisch Groove Coverage einstufen kann. Zugegeben, ich habe Indonesia noch nicht oft gehört und kann diesen Song nicht so beurteilen, aber auf jeden Fall - ich wäre dafür, dass gerade so ein Song auf den Markt käme, um der Bevölkerung zu beweisen, dass GC nicht nur Songs wie Holy Virgin haben."
5,"....na und. Durch aus nichts neues,hat Scooter schon so oft gemacht,die Lieder sind trotzem Geil wie ich finde. Habe die CD jetzt 4 mal durch,und bereue den Kauf auf keinen Fall. Durch die vielen ""Cover Songs"" hat man beim ersten mal schon das Gefühl,die CD schon mal gehört zu haben (Vorteil/Nachteil,muss jeder selber entscheiden). Kann natürlich gut sein,dass die CD schnell uninteressant wird,das wird sich aber erst in ein paar Tagen/Wochen zeigen. Mein Lieblings Titel,zur Zeit ist Lied Nr. 6 ""Bit A Bad Boy"", find ich Klasse. Mfg Markus D."
5,"Also, mit dieser Single haben sich die vier hochtalentierten Jungs aus England wiedereinmal selbst übertroffen! Beginnend mit ein paar melancholischen Klavierakkorden und Toms ruhiger Stimme schafft es eine perfekte Träumstimmung. Die Gitarren setzten zur zweiten Strophe ein, zunächst auch noch sehr ruhig, jedoch wirk Dannys Stimme schon etwas intensiver, nach und nach baut sich so eine gewaltige Spannung auf, die Danny auch wunderbar durch ein kraftvolles ""Whoa-a-a-a-a"" aufzulösen vermag. Noch ein paar intensivere Zeilen, bevor Tom ruhiger wird, doch sofort baut er wieder diese Spannung auf, ein etwas ruhigeres ""Whoa-a-a-a-a"", schließlich das krönende, kraftvoll zweistimmige Ende: ""Because the heart never lies1 'cause the heart never lies! Because the heart never lies!"" Doch haben sich die vier hier nicht nur musikalisch gesteigert, auch der Text ist ein Meisterstück! Als ich ihn las, konnte ich nicht anders als gerührt lächeln. Anders als in älteren Stücken, wo es bloß immer hieß: ""Ich bin nicht gut genug für sie"", ""Sie hat mich verlassen"" oder ""Sie hat einen Freund"" heißt es nun: ""But we are the lovers If you don't believe me Then just look into my eyes 'cause the heart never lies"" ""Wir sind die Liebenden Wenn du mir nicht glaubst Dann schau mir bloß in die Augen Weil das Herz niemals lügt"" ""If you want to fight I'll stand right beside you The day that you fall I'll be right behind you"" ""Wenn du kämpfen möchtest Werde ich rechts neben dir stehen An dem Tag an dem du fällst Werde ich direkt hinter dir sein"" ""Another year over And we're still together It's not always easy But I'm here forever"" ""Ein Jahr ist vorüber Und wir sind immer noch zusammen Es ist nicht immer einfach Aber ich bin für immer da"" Auch der Clip hat diese Entwischung mitgemacht. Anders als sonst ist diesmal kein humoristischer Aspekt eingebaut worden. Man sieht immer abwechselnd die vier Jungs im strömenden Regen ihren Song spielen und Szenen einer tragischen Liebesgeschichte, welche einen Streit und die Versöhnung kurz vor einem unglücklichen Tode beinhaltet. Alles in allem mehr als nur gelungen, es ist einmalig, was diese vier sehr jungen Musiker auf die Beine gestellt haben und wie sie sich bereits weiterentwickelt haben. Ans Herz legen kann ich dieses Stück auf jeden Fall allen, sich im Bereich Rock und Pop beheimatet fühlen und auch mal gerne eine Rock-Ballade einschalten, die Augen schließen, träumen, sich forttragen lassen. Aber auch Menschen, die sich normalerweise nicht im Gefilde des Pop-Rocks beheimatet fühlen ist die Single zu empfehlen, so höre ich z.B. eher mal Punk und Alternative und bin absolut kein aktiver Hörer von Busted, V, Kelly Clarkson und ähnlichen Künstlern^_^ [nachträglicher Eintrag:] Passend zu meiner letzten Aussage oben passt das Stück ""Ignorance"", welches sich ebenfalls auf dieser Single befindet. Wenn ich erwähne, dass es vom Bassisten Dougie geschrieben und ausschließlich von ihm und Danny gesungen wird, können es sich manche sicher schon vorstellen, um was es sich da handelt. Für alle anderen will ich folgendes sagen: Vom Stil würde ich es Richtung Punk-Rock oder gar Alternative einordnen, auf jeden Fall hat sich Dougie beim Schreiben sicherlich von seinen Idolen Blink-182 inspirieren lassen^_^ Es ist einfach rockig und nett-verrückt. Damit kann man sicher sagen, dass auf der Disc ""The Heart Never Lies"" wirklich was für jeden Geschmack dabei ist!"
1,"tja, wie erwartet ist die Scheibe meiner Meinung nach fast kompletter  Müll - wo ist Scooter geblieben ? wo ist take me baby - wo ist der alte Scooter Sound - wo seid Ihr ? Okay, Marian ist Euch ganz gut gelungen ( nur dafür gibts den einen Stern), aber der Rest ist echt für die Mülltonne............  Andreas"
5,"Wie immer eine geniale CD von As I Lay Dying! Die CdŽs sind vor allem genial designt. Das Booklet ist passend zum Cd-Layout und mit dem Wichtigsten, wie zum Beispielden Lyrics versehen. Als ein begeisteter Metalcore und As I Lay Dying Fan kann ich die CD nur jedem ans Herz legen."
5,"Ich bin ein großer Fan von Garth Brooks und habe bereits fast alle CD's und video's von ihm und da dürften auch nicht die Ultimate Hits fehlen.Als ich die Hits bekamm ende Oktober mußte ich natürlich gleich die DVD schau'n und muß sagen das sie einfach super ist da man ihn bei verschiedenen Live auftritten sieht und er viel zum ausdruck bringt was die Menschen dieser Welt so treiben ob gut oder böse wie z.B. bei: The Thunder Rolls, We Shall be Free , The Dance oder The Change vom Bombenattentat in Oklahoma.Ich hoffe das er nochmal auf die Bühne zurück kehrt und da weiter machte wo er aufgehört.Für mich ist und bleibt er eine feste größe in der New Country szene und deshalb bekommt er von mir volle 5 sterne."
5,"Mir gefällt diese Cd sehr gut,weil die Orginale sehr gut remixt wurden.Sie sind nicht zu poppig  aber auch nicht zu technomäßig.Mann kann gut zu der Musik tanzen sowohl aber auch träumen.Sehr toll finde ich auch,daß die Stimmungen,Melodien und der Gesang sehr gut unterlegt wurden sind und nichts verfälscht klingt.Mein persönlicher Anspieltip ist:Rage Hard-Young Person's Guide Into the 12 Inch Mix.Die Cd würde ich jedem empfehlen der ein Fan von Frankie goes to Hollywood ist und es etwas moderner mag."
5,Ein paar Maxis aus meinen Teenagerzeiten. Schön zum erinnern und sich wohlfühlen. Dazu noch günstig.
1,"Die LP habe ich schon Jahrzehnte - nun sollte die CD her. Doch ich dachte beim ersten Anhören, meine Bässe seien hinüber. Im Auto das Gleiche. Ich hatte noch nie eine CD mit so einer schlechten Klangqualität."
4,"Da ist es also, das Comeback-Album von Kim Wilde, auf das ich als alter Fan nach ihren letzten halbherzigen Best-of-plus-neue-Single-Versuchen nicht mehr zu hoffen gewagt hatte. Beim allerersten Hören enttäuscht die CD etwas. Leider hat Kim Wilde aus ihren Fehlern aus den 90ern nicht dazugelernt. Ihre aufgemotzten alten Hits sind allesamt mal mehr, mal weniger schrecklich. Ihre Ich-nehm-was-Olles-und-lege-einen-Techno-Beat-drunter-vielleicht-will-es-ja-jemand-hören-Masche hat schon früher nicht funktioniert und sie funktioniert auch jetzt nicht. Trotz Nena-Produzent Uwe Fahrenkrog-Petersen bleiben die ollen Kamellen lieblos aufgepeppt und meilenweit hinter den Originalen zurück. Leider ist man hier nicht den Nena-Weg gegangen. Anstatt den Hits von damals eine komplette Frischzellenkur zu verpassen, hat man sich für billiges Make-up entschieden. Dafür allerdings können ihre neuen Songs durch die Bank überzeugen. Zwar fehlt eine klare Linie, was angesichts der Vielzahl von Komponisten nicht weiter wundert, aber trotzdem rockt die neue Kim, und zwar gewaltig, und das auch nach mehrmaligem Hören. Es bleibt zwar mainstreamig und hat auch hier nicht die verschrobenen Qualitäten des letzten Nena-Albums (vor allem der zweiten CD), aber die Musik passt zu Kim Wilde, und es ist einfach schön, ihre unverkennbare Stimme in ganz neuen Songs zu hören. Unterm Strich hinterlässt das Album also einen zwiespältigen Eindruck: Gute, schnörkellose Popmusik auf der einen, phantasielose Neuinterpretationen auf der anderen Seite. Drei Sterne dafür. Und einen obendrauf, weil es einfach klasse ist, dass sie wieder da ist. Hoffentlich kommt da in Zukunft noch was!"
2,"Um mit den Asides anzufangen: Naja, all die schönen Lieder sind natürlich toll, allerdings noch toller in den Originalversionen. Dort bleiben sie wesentlich, hier werden sie aufgeblasen. Es ist nicht eine Version dabei, die nach Gewinn klingt. Da sind die Besides schon interessanter, weil tatsächlich ein paar Lieder dabei sind, die man von den Studioalben nicht kennt, z.B. ""Strike up the band"" und ein namenloses Lied, die beide nicht eben zu unrecht auf B-seiten erschienen sind. ""My foolish friend"" ragt da schon etwas weiter heraus aus den unbekannten Liedern, ohne wirklich mitzureißen. ""Why is it so hard"", ""Again a game"", ""Without you"" sind alle originell, wie fast alles der Gruppe. Aber je später die Lieder, desto schöner: ""It's getting late in the evening"", ""For what's worth"", ""Pictures of Bernadette"" und schließlich ""John Cope"" versöhnen dann doch. Diese CD ist eindeutig was für den Freak, der nicht genug bekommen kann. Für Einsteiger empfiehlt sich mit ""Colour of Spring"" oder ""Spirit of Eden"" anzufangen, dann ist es eh nur noch eine Frage der Zeit bis man den Rest dieser bemerkenswerten Band entdecken will..."
2,"Leider bin ich mit dem Begriff ""Very Best"" nicht einverstanden. Ich kenne nur die Hälfte der Songs, die auf diesem CD sind, diese sind super, allerdings gefallen mir die Stück, die ich nicht kenne gar nicht und habe deswegen Schwierigkeiten zu glauben, dass diese ""damals"" mal auch in den 80er Charts richtige Hits gewesen sind... Ansonsten wie gesagt höre ich die Stücke, die ich alle schon kannten immer wieder sehr gerne"
5,"Diana Ross hält seit über vierzig Jahren den Titel ""Queen of Motown"" und'""First Lady of Soul"". Zurecht... wie diese hervorragende Zusammenstellung einer beispiellosen Karriere beweist. Durch zahlreichen Nr.1 Hits und unverkennbare Klassiker, kann man sich von dem legendären Talent einer der besten und erfolgreichsten Sängerinnen aller Zeiten überzeugen. Ein Bonus-Track (""Goin` back"") und Hits wie ""Upside down"", ""Chain reaction"", ""Ain`t no mountain high enough"", ""Endless love"" (mit Lionel Richie), ""Take me higher"" sowíe ""Not over you yet"" lassen die Boxen beben. Adjeu Brintey, Tschüß Madonna... Macht Platz für Miss Ross. Das ist Musik!"
5,"Naja, Sandra kennt ja eigentlich jeder. Der Song Maria Magdalena ist ja weltbekannt. Also ich kannte ihn mal nicht, und kenne ihn auch bis heute nicht.  Aufmerksam wurde ich auf Sandra durch ihr Album ""Wheel of time"". Hat mir gut gefallen.  Und dieses Album find ich echt klasse. Allein schon der Anfang mit ""What d'ya think of me"" ist gut gewählt.  Klar gibt es auch den ein oder anderen Song, der einem nicht so gefällt. Ist halt Geschmacksache.  Aber alles in allem ein sehr gelungenes Comeback würde ich sagen.  Einen Fan hat sie mit dieser CD jedenfalls mehr....nämlich mich. :-)"
1,"Ich Nenne sowas mitsicherheit Musik Klar,und jeder hat auch seinen eigenen Geschmack. Aber Bill erinnert mich sehr sehr STARK an Nena.Die Stimme,sein aussehn-einfach alles.Und jedes Lied hört sich gleich an,etwas ruhig am anfang und dan gehts ab.nein,auch wenn ich die Jungs scheiße finde,würde ich nicht zögern ein lied von denen Zu Kaufen,SOBALD es mir gefällt.tut es aber nicht.Naja..."
5,"12:00 Uhr Nachts. Du sitzt am Straßenrand, es ist kalt. Nur die Straßenlaternen spenden etwas Licht. Vor dir ein weites Feld, irgendwo am Horizont ist der Schein einer Stadt zu erkennen. Einsamkeit. Du weinst stundenlang, während der aufziehende Regen deine Kleider nässt. Du liegst einfach da, und es könnte eine Ewigkeit sein. Und doch spürst du in dir Hoffnung eine mächtige Sehnsucht... So oder so, könnte man Together were Stranger beschreiben.  Diese CD von no-man, dem Projekt von Tim Bowness (Gesang) und Steven Wilson (Instrumente), birgt in ihren 47 Minuten Spielzeit eines der intensivsten Gefühlsbäder, welches mir je zu Ohren gekommen ist. Together were stranger, die meiner Meinung nach beste Scheibe des Projekts, ist nämlich ein Meisterwerk geworden, ein Meisterwerk der Stille. Die Musik selber ist eine Mischung aus Ambient und langsamen Artpop der Marke Talk Talk oder David Sylvian. Zerbrechlichste Melodien, geisthafter Gesang, spärliche Instrumentierung und Soundscapes, die so weit und so schön sind, dass man vor Sehnsucht am liebsten vor den Boxen kauern und heulen möchte. Jeder Song, sei es das floydige Titelstück, das dramatische Photographs in Black and White oder das wunderbare Back when you were beautiful, entwickelt und entfaltet die zarten, herzzerreißenden Melodien nur sehr langsam. Dazu wirkt die zurückhaltende Percussion (lediglich Becken werden benutzt!), die ausladenden Keyboards und einfache Akustikgitarre auf den ersten Hördurchgang langweilig und eintönig. Allerdings zeigt sich beim zweiten Versuch mit Kopfhörern (!), dass Wilson und Bowness meisterhafte Klangarchitekten sind und dass es trotz der hohen, atmosphärischen Dichte nie monoton wird. Trotzdem möchte ich hier eine kleine Warnung aussprechen: Leute, die Shape of my Heart von den Backstreet Boys traurig nennen und schon bei My Heart will go on (Titellied von Titanic) anfangen zu heulen, möchte ich Together were stranger eher abraten.  Liebe Hörer, DIESE Musik ist der Inbegriff der Sehnsucht, der zu Klang gewordenen Schönheit und der stillen Trauer. Und doch hört man immer wieder etwas Positives heraus. DAS wühlt natürlich, trotz oder gerade wegen der vorherrschenden Ruhe auf dieser CD, emotional auf. Fazit: Eine perfekte Ambient/Pop-CD, für alle Fans von Talk Talk, Sylvian und natürlich No-man! KAUFEN!  FINGER WEG, wenn Sie emotional nicht so viel verkraften... Hört sich an wie:   Weiterer Tipp zum Reinhören:"
4,"Gar nicht schlecht gemacht das Ganze ! Unabhängig davon, dass man nicht jeden Tag eine hebräisch singende Rockband zu hören bekommt, muss man den Jungs von ""Amaseffer"" bescheinigen, dass auf ihrem Album ""Slaves for live"" eine sehr interessante Mischung aus Progmetal, orientalischen Klängen, und durchaus eingängigen Rockelementen bieten. Gut, die Vertonung der alttestamentarischen Flucht der Israeliten aus Ägypten geht nicht ganz kitschfrei über die Bühne, aber insgesamt gesehen liegt hier eindeutig eine Veröffentlichung aus dem oberen Drittel der Progrockszene vor."
1,"Ich fand ja das Lied Pon de Replay war der Hammer bis ich das Album kaufte. Sie versucht in meinen Augen so wie Beyonce zu sein was, aber gar nicht der Fall ist. Ihre Stimme find ich bei manchen lidern grauenhaft ,weil sie so kwischt. Ich meine das Album ist nur Geld verschwendung sowie auch Zeit und man hat nach einer gewissen Zeit keine Lust mehr die Lieder zu hören, wenn man noch etwas hört kann (kwischen = Ohrenschmerzen). Von ganzen 13 liedern find ich gerade mal nur einen schön in dem Fall Pon de Replay und eins durchschnittlich und in dem Fall Music of the sun. Ich rate ehe von diesem Album ab, weil es nicht so richtig überzeugt. Eigentlich ist auch ein Stern zu viel, aber mann kann ja nicht schlechter  bewerten (schade eigentlich)."
4,"XTC's Debüt 'White Music' ist für alle, die Punk *und* Pop mögen genau das Richtige. Im Gegensatz zu XTC's späteren mehr ruhigen und melodischen Songs, in welche Kategorie wohl auch ihr wohl bekanntestes Lied 'Making Plans for Nigel' eher einzuordnen ist, sind die Stücke auf White Music eher unruhig, schräg und manchmal auch lustig. Für jemanden, der diese Seite von XTC nicht kennt und mehr auf ""schöne"" Musik steht ist der Kauf dieser CD wohl nicht uneingeschränkt empfehlbar. Man sollte sich besser erstmal ein, zwei Lieder anhören. Die bekanntesten Lieder auf der Scheibe sind wohl 'This is Pop' und 'Science Friction', die auch auf der Singles Collection 'Fossil Fuel' enthalten sind. Ich persönlich habe mir diese CD gekauft weil mir eben diese Lieder auf 'Fossil Fuel' mit Abstand am besten gefielen. Ich wurde nicht enttäuscht, denn alle Lieder auf 'White Music' sind in diesem Stil gehalten."
5,"Der Soundtrack von KANK ist einfach genial. Alle Songs sind echt wunderschön, besonders ""Tumhi Dekho Naa"" &amp; ""Rock 'n' Roll Soniye"". Die Songs machen richtig süchtig, ich höre sie jeden Tag! Der Film wird bestimmt genauso gut!!! Für Bollywood-Fans ein MUSS! Einfach empfehlenswert!"
5,"...so ein Wiedersehen mit (neuen) Songperlen von Stephen Malkmus.Und was mir mit seinen Songs passiert,geschieht jedes Mal von Neuem wieder:Zuerst höre ich das Album und bin ein wenig befremdet oder vor den Kopf gestoßen,aufgrund der vielen Ideen,Sounds und Gimmicks,die in den Songs durchschimmern.Nach mehrmaligen Hörem bekomme ich jedoch die Melodien und Songs nicht mehr aus meinem Kopf.Irgendwie schön,daß Stephen Malkmus außergewöhnliche Musik macht.Irgendwie schön,daß er so ein Dasein abseits des Musikmainstreams genießt.Denn die Leute,die seine Musik schätzen und lieben,wissen warum-so wie ich..."
5,"... was im Jahr 2007 an electrotango auf den Markt gekommen ist! Mar dulce bietet kraftvolle up- udn downbeat-Stücke, die alle tanzbar sind - und dabei auch noch unheimlich viel Abwechslung schaffen. Bewundernswert, was die Musiker da geschaffen haben - und ein Muss für jeden DJ!!"
5,"Eine tolle Serie mit schönen Liedern und einer netten Geschichte! Viele nützliche Informationen rund um Land, Leute, Essen, Sehenswürdigkeiten und die Geschichte Spaniens! Nett verpackt in eine nette Art Musical...Lieder die ins Ohr gehen, für die ganze Familie! Unsere Tochter wünscht sich jetzt die Stoff-Reisemaus und wird ihr bestimmt auch noch eine Mail schreiben...sogar das ist möglich bei der Reisemaus! Eine tolle Serie, die Vorfreude auf die Reise und das Neue in fremden Ländern macht! Super!!!"
5,"Einfach eine tolle Cd, auch für die Menschen die sonst dieses Musik überhaupt nicht hören! Ich selbst höre sonst eigentlich Gabber (was viele ja noch nicht einmal als Musik bezeichnen) und war von dem Film und der Cd so überwältigt. Einfach Klasse!"
4,Nicht viel Neues - aber das auf höchstem Niveau.
5,"Mit einer Mischung aus Past our means und A place called home melden sich Ignite endlich mit einem grandiosen Album zurück. Die Titel gehen voll ab, mit einem satten Sound der seinesgleichen sucht. Doch noch überzeugender als auf CD oder Vinyl sind die Jungs live - überzeug Dich selbst!!!"
2,"Nun, angefangen habe ich von hinten - bei amnesiac. Da kam ich sozusagen auf den Geschmack und kaufte mir von hinten nach vorne alle Radiohead-CDs. Zuletzt dieses ding. Ich muss sagen, ich war schlicht und ergreifen enttäuscht. Langweilig, laut, einfallslos... Der einzige Lichtblick ist ""creep"", aber deswegen hätte ich mir die CD auch nicht kaufen müssen. Die 2 Sterne bekommen sie im übrigen nur, weil sie Radiohead sind. Aber nicht vergessen: In Wirklichkeit sind sie ja immer besser geworden!"
4,"Dies ist ein großes Album, wenn man mal was ""besonderes"" hören will. Außerhalb des main-streams, trotzdem echt McCartney. Manches erinnert an ""John"" und ""Paul"", eben an die ""Beatles"".  Geboten werden Experimente aber auch eingängige Rock-Songs. Manches hört sich so an, als sei es in anderen Spähren entstanden, als habe er die Pforten der Wahrnehmung erneut aufgestoßen. Frisch, überraschend und wert, dass man es öfters hört, auch mal richtig krachend laut. Gute Arbeit Paul,und die besten Wünsche!"
5,"Also ich kann mich meinem Vorrdener absolut nicht anschliessen! Splinter ist endlich Mal wieder The Offspring wie sie sein sollten: schnell, hard, und punkig."
5,"Ich lege diese CD auf, wenn ich mich entspannen will, oder auch zum Meditieren. Aber ganz besonders gerne liebe ich es, mit ihr einzuschlafen. Nicht falsch verstehen, sie ist nicht etwa langweilig, so dass man einschlafen müsste, nein! Aber ich liege dann noch ein Weilchen im Bett, habe eine Lampe an, die sich langsam von selbst runterdimmt und immer dunkler wird und sich nach einer halben Stunde selbst ausschaltet, währenddessen liege ich und höre zu und entspanne mich, denke auch noch ein bißchen über den Tag nach und schlummere dann ganz sachte ein. Ein absoluter Genuss!"
1,"Im Studio augenommene Comedy-CDs sind ja an sich schon eine wirklich schlechte Idee. Die Witze kommen nicht so richtig rüber, alles wirkt sehr kalt und steril (ich vermisse halt das Lachen und Schreien des Publikums) und das ganze Teil reißt nicht so richtig mit. Aber wenn ich mir zu allem (langweiligen) Übel auch noch zum 15 Mal die Phrase ""... is klar, ne?!"" anhören muß, dann zieht das meinen Finger doch magisch zum Stopp-Knopf."
2,"Ein von der Musikindustrie zwar hochgelobter Musiker, den ich kürzlich live erleben durfte und seither keinesweges zu den großen Musikern zählen würde, aber zu denen, die geltungsbedürftig sind. Sein Debüt geht da auch gleich in die Richtung des grossen Publikkums, sprich der einfachen Kost. Wenn Sony dahintersteckt, stimmen dann auch die Kritikerstimmen....Mein Eindruck: ziemlich überflüssig, diese Lieder auf der Bratsche nachzuspielen, denn diese Interpretationen sind nicht besonders facettenreich. Da höre man lieber die Sänger."
5,"Die drei ??? gewinnen ein Wochendene in einem Gruselhotel und werden durch nicht eingeplante Vorfälle in einen neuen Fall verwickelt. Alle Fäden ziehen sich in der Höhle des Grauens zusammen und dort liegt das Geheimnis, dass es zu lüften gilt. Endlich mal wieder eine Folge, die sich durch große Spannung und Gänsehaut auszeichnet. Mich hat der Spannungsbogen etwas an die Folge ""Das Gespensterschloss"" erinnert, und diese Folge gehört zu den Besten. Zugreifen, es lohnt sich!"
1,"nur leider ist auf ihr auch ""Alleinesein"" drauf, völlige Platzverschwendung. Das lied ist grottenschlecht, der Text gruselt so vor sich hin, die Musik klingt wie Wildecker Herzbuben auf Drogen. Der gute Heppner macht so klasse Lieder, keine Ahnung was er sich bei diesem Song gedacht hat."
1,"Ich muß sagen, ich bin enttäuscht von der neuen Single. Nicht irgendwie besonders. Außerdem klingt der Refrain mehr oder weniger genau so wie Herbert Grönemeyers 'Land unter' und Lutricia McNeals 'Wrong or Right'. Ich unterstelle keine Absicht, es ist aber trotzdem nicht schön."
1,"Das war mit Abstand das schlechteste Album, dass ich mir in den letzten Monaten gekauft hab!"
5,"Bin wie viele anderen durch den Titel ""This ain't a Scene it's an arms race"" auf die Band gekommen und hab mir ein paar Monate später das ganze Album ""Infinity on high"" geholt, welches ich immer noch als eins der besten Alben, die ich je gehört habe, einschätze. Um meinen Hunger nach noch mehr Fall Out Boy zu stillen bin ich eine Stufe zurückgegangen und hab mir ""From Under the Cork Tree"" zugelegt. Beim ersten zuhören war ich etwas enttäuscht, da irgendwie etwas fehlte. Aber schon beim zweiten Mal stieg die Begeisterung, bis die Platte letztendlich rauf und runter lief. Die Musik kommt locker und dennoch popig daher, wodurch sie sich immer und immer wieder zu den verschiedensten Gelegenheiten hören lässt. Freue mich schon, wenn ich das erste Mal eine längere Autofahrt mit ""From under the cork tree"" im CD-Player starten kann. Gute Laune garantiert!"
5,"Coole Basslinie, schöne Backgroundvocals (vor allem an der Stelle 2:44) und lässige Stimme dazu. Dass sind die Highlights des Lieds. Neben dem Text, den ich persönlich sehr gelungen finde (in der Video-Version wird er ja leider an gewissen Stellen gemutet... Schade...). Meine Lieblingsstelle im Video ist sobald sie die Rosen auf den Sarg wirft, hat meiner Ansicht nach einen wunderbar tragisch-schönen Effekt. Amy sollte nur ein wenig auf sich aufpassen... Finger weg von den Drogen und werde stattdessen durch deine Musik high. 5* für ""Back to black"""
5,ist dieses meisterwerk ich hoffe sie bleibt bei ihrem stil(muskalisch meine ich)und die nummer In my Bed ist für mich nicht mehr zu toppen.Frank finde ich um längen besser als Back to Black obwohl es auch supa ist.Was soll ich sagen sie klingt eben so schön dreckig.
1,"Der Sound der gesamten ""Remaster""-CD von Gary Moore ist akustischer Schrott.  Ich habe mich sehr geärgert, mir die aufgrund des günstigen Preises gleich im Paket zugelegt zu haben.  Eine Frechheit - nur Höhen, kein Baß und nix. Einfach nur schlecht.  Und das ist schade - denn das Album ist natürlich über jeden Zweifel erhaben und die Boni machen eigentlich einen Knaller daraus - daher ein Stern.  Der miese Brotbüchsensound macht aber leider alles zunichte !  Daher Finger weg !"
2,"Ja, so klangen eben die 80er. Entsetzliche elektronisch nachscheppernde Drums, sehr einfache, sich permanent wiederholende Rhythmen (Drums eben wie ein Uhrwerk ohne besondere Fill-ins), noch furchtbarere Synthesizer. Die Songs sind ganz nett, aber irgendwie auch im 80er Stil komponiert (wäre mal interessant, wie es in modernem Klanggewand klingen könnte). Die Gitarre: ja, es ist Gary Moore, aber eigentlich in der Entwicklung zu seinem letztendlichen Stil. Vieles klingt unfertig, nur angedacht. Mit der Gitarre strophenlang nur die Gesangsstimme zu imitieren, reicht nicht. 2 Sterne gibt es nur für sein außergewöhnliches Talent. ""The Loner"" hat eine schöne Melodie, diese wird aber viel zu wenig ausgebaut. Zum Schluss, als er dann endlich mal improvisiert (was seine Stärke ist), wird ausgeblendet. Nee, gefällt mir nicht. Wer 80er Rocksound mag, ist hier bestens bedient. Wer Gary Moore hören will, muss sich die Blues und Bluesrock-Scheiben ab 1990 kaufen. Wer das Projekt ""Scars"" noch nicht kennt, wird nicht verstehen, was ich meine. Still got the blues."
5,"das album ist die bombe! kauft euch den scheiß(anstatt auf rapidshare rumzuhängen lauft in den laden;)) . is wirklich das bis dato geilste album aus dem hause aggro, bis auf ccn1 xD. frank white und godsilla ergänzen sich einfach perfekt. auch die features wurden sehr gut eingesetzt (kingorgi und frauenarzt haben fette parts).ich feier bis auf 2-3 lieder wirklich jeden song!! kaufen atzen  mfg felix"
1,Tut mir Leid aber das ist die Schlechteste Aggro Ansage die ich je gehört habe!!Sehr leichte Tracks!!Die einzigen wo in Richtung gut sind: Du bist Scheise Fiesta Aggro Berlin Ding ansonstens bin ich von der Ansage sehr enttäuscht hab deutlich mehr erwartet nach Ansage 5!
5,"Das Album ist echt gelungen, was ich toll finde, das viele Lieder drauf sind, die auch mal langsamer sind, aber das Label Aggro Berlin, nimmt stark ab, wer richtig guten Rap hören will sollte sich das Label Safemade Records näher absehen. Neuste Alben von Selfmade Kollegah- Kollegah Chroink2 erscheinung im April"
5,"Hab das Album jetzt zu Hause. Also Hype in oder her. Bis auf 2-3 Ausreiser wo mich der Text nicht so flasht, ist das Album sehr cool geworden."
5,"Wer die harten Battletracks von King Orgasmus One mochte, wird dieses Album lieben. Ich selber finde seine Partytracks eher weniger gelungen (Imbiss Bronko ist z.B überhaupt nicht mein Fall), ich stehe mehr auf die harten Tracks, vorallem die mit den ""dunklen"" Raiden Beats. Und das Album besteht glücklicherweise aus 90% davon. Meiner Meinung nach das beste Orgi Album. Schon allein wegen Tracks wie ""Es gibt kein Battle II"" ist es ein Kauf Wert. Hoffentlich kommt ein La Petite Mort 2!"
5,"Von Kindheit an kenne ich vor allem das Konzert e-moll und habe im Laufe der Zeit viele Einspielungen sowohl dieses als auch des anderen in f-moll gehört. Verschiedene Aufnahmen des 1. Konzerts (chronologisch bekanntlich der Nr. 2) überzeugten mich in der einen oder anderen Hinsicht: Pollini spielt technisch unfehlbar und bietet eine schlüssige, doch etwas unterkühlte Interpretation. Martha Argerich (in der frühen Aufnahme unter Abbado, die spätere ist mir schwer erträglich) kehrt von Anfang an die nervöse, gespannte Seite des Stückes hervor und bricht am Ende des ersten Satzes in einen Wirbelsturm aus, der einem den Atem nehmen will; dafür ist sie an anderen Stellen geradezu farblos und schlaff. Murray Perahia hat sich mit Zubin Mehta den Preis für die beste Chopin-Einspielung des Jahres redlich verdient, denn sein Spiel ist sehr kultiviert und nobel, lyrisch und zugleich technisch sicher. Aber dennoch will sich eine eigentliche Begeisterung nicht einstellen. Irgendwie wirkt alles ""zu solide"", wenn man so sagen darf. Bleibt die hohepriesterliche Interpretation des alten Claudio Arrau mit dem London Philharmonic Orchestra unter Inbal: Niemand vermag diese Musik derart zu zelebrieren und gleichsam aus dem Inneren heraus klingen zu lassen! Man ist geradezu erschüttert. Aber spielt Arrau nicht doch viel zu langsam? Entspricht er damit noch dem Willen des Meisters? Vor allem den brillanten Schlußsätzen tut er damit reichlich Gewalt an. So bewegte ich mich immer wieder von Arrau weg und dann doch wieder zu ihm hin. Krystian Zimermans frühere Aufnahme unter Giulini war mir wohl bekannt, hatte mich aber nicht gefangen genommen; daher zog ich die zweite Einspielung gar nicht in Betracht. Bis ich sie endlich zu hören bekam... Hiermit habe ich gefunden, was ich so lange suchte: die vollkommene Aufnahme der Chopin-Konzerte. Alle Mängel, die an anderen Interpretationen zu finden sind, überwindet der polnische Meisterpianist spielend, und alles Gute, was man von Pollini, Argerich, Perahia, Arrau und anderen gerne behalten möchte, schenkt er uns überreich: höchste technische Brillanz und Virtuosität, gepaart mit feinster, nuancenreichster Anschlagskultur, inspiriertestes Spiel, das ständig den Eindruck der Evidenz vermittelt (""Ja, genau so muß es einfach sein!"") und so weiter und so fort. Dazu kommt das Orchester, das wirklich als selbständiger Partner agiert und die elenden Gemeinplätze, Chopin habe mit diesem nicht viel anzufangen gewußt, unablässig Lügen straft. Zimerman spielt das Orchester ähnlich gut wie seinen Steinway! Man möchte sich, obwohl das stilistisch nicht sehr gut ist, in Superlativen überschlagen. Summa summarum jedenfalls: Diese Aufnahme ist es! Diese und keine andere!"
1,"Ich schreibe mal als nicht 150 % Tracy Fan der eventuell nicht alles durch die Rosa Brille sieht. Mir entzieht diese CD alle Lebensgeister und ich bekomme eine Weltuntergangsstimmung wie sie im Buche steht.Schon die Where you live hat mir nicht mehr gefallen,da sie für meinen Geschmack nicht so eingängige Melodien geboten hat.Von den Texten mal abgesehen.Aber mit diesem Werk hat sich Tracy bis auf------ für mich absolut in die depressive Ecke gestellt.Mag ja sein das viele Alte Fan`s mit diesem Material klar kommen,aber neue Freunde wird Sie damit wohl nicht gewinnen."
5,"Man wird mit dieser Platte nicht viel anfangen können wenn man sich seines Glaubens nicht gewiss ist. Zu befreundend sind die Texte und zu offensichtlich ist es Dylan mit seiner Anbetung, Ausrichtung zu Gott. Entgegen vielerlei Ansicht Bob Dylan sei wieder zu seinen jüdischen Wurzeln zurückgekehrt muss ich anmerken das er einige Lieder der Triologie (Slow train coming/Saved/Shot of love, das wohl ""verträglichste"" Album für Nichtchristen) bis heute in seiner Setlist hat. Ob ein orthodoxer Jude tatsächlich Jesus für Golgatha dankt? Nun ja, ich weiß nich.  ""Saved"" zeugt von Bob's Leidenschaft für Gott. Wer sich inspirieren lassen will, dem wird dieses Album schlichtwegs umhauen. Eine Herausforderung für jeden Christen sein Leben komplett für den Herrn zu führen, sich nicht von Meinungen von Gemeinde/Kirche/Freunden/Welt ablenken zu lassen. Eine Möglichkeit seinen Kopf und Herz neu nach Gottes Maßstäben ausrichten zu lassen. Sein Vertrauen allein in und auf Gott zu legen. Selten habe ich Musik gehört die mich so tief drin bearbeitet hat."
5,"Ich habe mit Meister Dylan wirklich so meine Probleme.  Nicht nur sein hinlänglich bekannter eingenwilliger Gesangsstil, auch seine auf mich immer etwas unfertig und roh wirkenden Songs sind sonst nicht so ganz mein Ding.  ""Desire"" ist daher eines der ganz wenigen Dylan-Alben das ich mir regelmäßig in den CD-Player schiebe. Die fast schon episch gewaltigen Balladen ""Joey"" und ""Story of the hurricane"" sind nicht nur textlich eine Liga für sich, sondern auch hervorragend instrumentiert. Auch sämtlich anderen Songs sind weit überdurchschnittlich und bestechen mit ihrem warmen und doch irgendwie kratzigen Folksound. Auch für Leute die sonst auf den Gesang von Bob Dylan etwas allergisch reagieren, ist ""Desire"" ein höchst empfehlenswertes Album."
5,"Beim Höhren dieser Songs fällt mir folgender Satz ein. ""Wahre Kunst zeigt sich in der Mühelosigkeit"". Die Lässigkeit mit der diese Lieder dargeboten werden verlangt grosses Können."
1,"Das soll er nun also sein: Der neue Bond-Titelsong. Bislang dachte ich, dass Madonna mit ""Die another Day"" die Hitparade der schlechtesten Bond-Songs anführt, so gibt es mit ""Another Way to die"" (die namentliche Ähnlichkeit der beiden Titel sollte zu denken geben) einen neuen Tiefpunkt. Dieses strukturlose R'nB-Geschwurbel mit teilweise erschreckend atonalen Stimmen, die wie in einem Schuppen aufgenommen klingen und von jedem ""Germany sucht den nächsten Superduperpopstar""-Absolventen locker getoppt werden könnten, ist für das High-Tech-Produkt und Filmlegende James Bond ein peinlicher Witz. Es gibt keine wirkliche Melodie und ständig drängen sich kurze, aber nervende Insturmentalparts in den Aufbau, der irgendwie verzweifelt nach Bond klingen möchte, es aber nicht hinbekommt. Wenn Jack White behauptet, er hätte bei John Barry Inspiration gesucht und ""On Her Majesty Secret Service"" als Vorbild genommen, dann muss ich hier mal trocken husten. Wenn dem so ist, hat White nichts verstanden und ein 08/15-Produkt aus der Standard-Musikmaschinerie geliefert, welches kaum in Erinnerung bleiben wird. Hätte man mal besser Amy Winehouse, Duffy oder Gabriella Cilmi machen lassen. ""Another Way to die"" ist alles, nur kein Bond-Song. Jetzt lege ich Tina Turner ein und genieße den letzten wahren Bond-Titelsong ""GoldenEye"". Es lebe der Bombast!"
2,"Voller Vorfreude war ich, als ich die CD zum ersten Mal in meinen CD-Player legte, um gleichdarauf bitter enttäuscht zu werden: Zwischen den einzelnen Tracks, bzw. vor den einzelnen Tracks finden dauernd irgendwelche englischsprachige Filmdialoge statt, die die CD schlichtweg ""unhörbar"" machen. Eine Schande, dass eine solch geniale Musik von diesem störenden Gelaber ""verstümmelt"" wird. Für Leute, die Freunde der Musik sind, und den Film nicht als absoluten Kult ansehen, für die ist die CD nicht zu gebrauchen."
5,"ist dieser Soundtrack. Robert Rodriguez hat nicht nur als Regisseur &amp; Lichtbildner treffend gewirkt (Desperado, Once upon a time in Mexico) sondern immer auch ganzheitlich die jeweils passende Musik ausgewählt, sozusagen Sergio Leone und Ennio Morricone in einer Person. Die Titel transportieren auch alleine treffend die Stimmung von Frank Millers Sichtweisen zu Sin City, jazzig, verraucht, düster, hoffnungslos;  gerade wegen der konsequenten Schwarz-Weiß-Wiedergabe des Films mit wenigen Farbflecken transportiert diese Filmmusik die Stimmung und Farbigkeit. Diese CD wirkt außerdem polarisierend wie der Film: man liebt sie richtig oder lehnt sie total ab. Ich muß sie jedenfalls allein hören ... Weil dieses Soundtrack-Album (wie Desperado, Once upon a time in Mexico, die Kill Bill-Sammlung) auch allein stehend wirkt: Fünf Sterne, Kaufempfehlung. Nur Vorsicht beim Hören im nebligen November wegen der partiell depressiven Stimmung ..."
5,"Hallo, die Lieferung war sehr schnell. Bin überaus zufrieden und wurde von Amazon bisher noch nicht enttäuscht. Vielen Dank"
2,"Wer eine Hendrix CD sucht auf der ""die wichtigsten"" Lieder dieses Künstlers vertreten sind, sollte die Finger von diesem Angebot lassen. Hier sind vor allem Live Aufnahmen des Künstlers zu finden.  Doch Achtung:Bei dieser Doppel-CD handelt es sich vor allem um Rarities/Obscurities des Künstlers. Für wirkliche Fans interessant, alle anderen dürfte die schlechte Qualität der meisten Tracks abschrecken. Wer also eine gute Compilation vom Schaffen Hendrix sucht, sollte woanders schauen. Wer eine gute Live-Aufnahme dieses Ausnahmekünstlers will, ebenfalls! Hier fehlt eindeutig eine deutliche Definition was auf dieser Doppel-CD geboten wird! Ich hoffe dem habe ich mit dieser Rezension abgeholfen."
4,"Vanessa Mae probiert auf dieser CD einiges Neues aus, mit mehr oder weniger Erfolg. Einige Titel, besonders Destiny, sind sehr extrem gigantisch gut! Aber andere hier besonders White Bird sind nicht wirklich berauschend. Es ist nicht das Vanessa Mae nicht singen könnte, ganz im gegenteil ihr Stimme gefällt mir (ich freu mich schon in Zukunpft mehr von ihr zuhören), aber das Lied ist schwach. Dieser Schlager hätte nie wieder auferstehen dürfen! Dies war ein Fehler! Dafür ein Stern abzug. Insgesamt lohnt sich diese CD auf jeden Fall!"
2,"Tonight wird von vielen Fans als das schlechteste Werk Bowies bezeichnet - durchaus nachvollziehbar. Die meisten Songs sind uninspirierter 80er Pop. Bowie fühlte sich nach dem Millionenerfolg von Let's Dance seinen vielen neuen Fans verpflichtet und bewies dabei, dass er sich im Mainstream nicht entfalten kann. Bezeichnend auch, dass ein guter Teil von Tonight aus Coverversionen besteht. Hier hat ein Künstler den Bezug zu seiner Kunst verloren. Trotzdem, selbst auf dieser Platte ist Bowies Genie zu erkennen. Immerhin 2 brauchbare Songs gibt es zu verzeichnen:  das flache, aber sehr eingängige Blue Jean und vor allem Loving the Alien. Dieses Lied allein rechtfertigt die Existenz des Albums. Ein Klassiker, den Bowie (in einer verbesserten Version) gerne live vorträgt. So sollte sich der geneigte Fan auch nicht grämen - Tonight mag als Album nicht viel wert sein, es hat uns aber eine weitere Großtat des Meisters beschert. Und das ist, was bleibt."
5,"Diese Beiden haben es geschafft feinste Rockmusik mit Entertainment zu kombinieren. Leider muss ich feststellen ,dass mir manche Songs in der TV-Serie besser gefallen als die ausproduzierten Studioversionen. Dennoch ist dieses Album ein Meisterwerk. Schön das uns die Beiden zeigen das man sich als Musiker nicht an Marktregeln halten muß. Die Länge der Songs hält sich nicht an das übliche 3min-Format. Warum auch? Die Songtexte sind anmanchen Stellen genuschelt. Alles was zählt ist, das es rockt."
1,"Erschreckend! Als alter Jackson-Fan (habe bisher alle CD's außer den grausamen Weihnachts-CD's) habe ich die CD blind gekauft. Das war ein Fehler. Außer Alans Stimme, die man natürlich sofort wieder erkennt, erinnert nichts an die anderen CD's. Es scheint sich eher um eine heimliche Fortsetzung seines Gospel-Trips zu handeln. Alle Stücke sind von der Grundstimmung zum Verwechseln ähnlich. Es lohnt nicht, die Titel einzeln zu besprechen! Keine Melodie, kein Gitarrenriff bleibt im Ohr hängen. Es ist ein Jammer, wenn sich ein so begnadeter Songwriter nur fremder Stücke bedient (außer dem - faden - Neuaufguss von ""A Woman's Love""). Was nutzt es da, wenn die Titel gut instrumentiert und die CD technisch gut produziert ist? Alles in allem ist diese CD für echte Alan-Jackson-Fans völlig ungeeignet. Vielleicht eher etwas für Frank-Sinatra-Fans. Aber warum sollen die ausgerechnet auf Alan Jackson kommen?"
4,"habe vergeblich nach galway girl auf dieser cd gesucht... ansonsten aber sind die songs gut zusammengestellt! im großen und ganzen doch empfehlenswert, wer den film mag, kann sich auch beruhigt die cd holen."
5,"Was war ich doch erleichtert, endlich (!!!) die neue Platte von Jimmy Eat World in den Händen zu halten. Lange hat es ja gedauert, über drei Jahre um genau zu sein. Jeder der wie ich absoluter JEW Fan ist, weiß, dass das eine verdammt lange und verdammt quälende Wartezeit ist. Die Erwartungen an das neue Album waren natürlich riesig, schließlich haben sie schon mit den drei Vorgängern, dem hymnischen und teils brachialen Static Prevails, dem EMOtionalen und tiefsttraurigen Clarity und der kraftvollen Hitsammlung Bleed American, bewiesen was für eine Ausnahmeband sie doch sind. Tja ""Futures"" heißt nun also das neue Baby, das mir in den nächsten Monaten brav zur Seite stehen soll. Und was soll ich sagen, sie haben es schon wieder geschafft, die Musikwelt mit einer weiteren tollen Platte zu begeistern. Jim Adkins und seine Mannen sind einfach begnadete Musiker, die einfach wunderschöne, epische, energische, hymnische, traurige (mir fehlen die Worte ^_^) Songs schreiben und einspielen können und allen anderen Bands dabei um Längen voraus sind. Anfangs war man noch skeptisch, ob das neue Album überhaupt an alte Zeiten anknüpfen kann, schließlich wurde der langjährige und mit der Band befreundete Produzent Mark Trombino quasi gefeuert und durch Gil Norten (Pixies, Feeder, Dashboard Confessional, Foo Fighters) ersetzt. Die ersten Durchläufe ist man dann doch etwas enttäuscht. Die  Spritzigkeit und Eingängigkeit wie bei Bleed American sucht man anfangs vergebens, vielmehr schleichen sich die Songs von hinten an und packen einen dann aber gewaltig. Songs wie die geniale Halbballade ""Work"", das epische und wunderschöne ""23"" und das umstrittene, in meinen Augen aber wunderbare ""Night Drive"" sind mit die besten Songs, die Jimmy Eat World je geschrieben haben. In Sachen Balladen sind sie einfach am Besten. Doch auch der Rest weiß zu begeistern: Krachige Titel wie ""Nothingwrong"", ""Pain"", ""Just Tonight"" und ""Futures"" hätten ebenso auf den Vorgängern vertreten sein können, ohne aber Eigenständigkeit zu vermissen oder Mitsing Songs wie ""Kill"" und ""The Love You Had"", die einem gar nicht mehr aus dem Kopf gehen wollen.  Dann gibt es noch die Songs die Zeit benötigen, viel Zeit um genau zu sein. Zum einen ""Drugs Or Me"", eine Ballade, die einem anfangs noch etwas langweilig erscheint mit jedem Hören aber immer mehr ins Herz trift und der abschließende Bonus Song ""Shame"", der noch aus der Trombino'schen Produktion stammt und sehr sphärisch daherkommt und neugierig macht, wie sich die Songs wohl unter seiner Federführung angehört hätten. Leider müssen die deutschen Käufer aber auf den zweiten Bonus Song ""When I Want"" verzichten. Zu guter letzt MUSS noch ""Polaris"" erwähnt werden, ein Stück das an Clarity Glanzzeiten erinnert (""For Me This Is Heaven"") und ein weiteres Highlight darstellt.  Tja was bleibt mir jetzt zum Schluss noch zu sagen? Ein weiteres Clarity oder Bleed American ist es nicht ganz geworden. Dazu nutzen sich die Songs letztlich doch etwas schneller ab und die Parallen zu den Vorgängern sind doch hörbar. Aber was solls, Jimmy Eat World haben gezeigt, das sie noch lange nicht zum alten Eisen gehören und die ganze, junge Emofraktion immer noch mit Leichtigkeit schlagen können. Und hoffentlich müssen wir uns nicht wieder so lange gedulden, bis ihr nächstes Meisterwerk in den Regalen steht..."
2,"Ich wünschte, dieses Album wäre das, was es hätte sein können. Eine dunkle Reise durch eine nie endende Nacht, dumpf glühende Lava, Klanggebäude kurz vom Einsturz, instrumentale Zerbrechlichkeit, Schmerz in Noten. Nein, tut mir leid. Vielleicht ist das alles mehr oder weniger gemeint, doch diese Kompositionen zeichnen sich nur durch ihre Länge aus, gehaltvoll ist das praktisch gar nicht. Wenn das die Avantgarde des Progrock oder Postrock oder was auch immer ist, dann sieht mir das zu wacklig aus. Zwar gibt es interessante Abschnitte, aber es wirkt nicht besonders ausgefeilt im Detail, hier sind keine Virtuosen am Werk, eher welche, die glauben, dass ein paar aufgenommene Soundschnipsel gesprochener Sätze mit apokalyptischem Hintergrund zusammen mit harmlosen Gitarrengegreife schon Kunst sein müssen, nur weil jemand vom Krieg raunt. Das könnte alles so spannend sein und ist doch so langweilig. Was hier musikalisch ausgedrückt wird, dafür hätten auch zwanzig Minuten gereicht. Und dann wäre es immer noch nicht innovativ. Doch genau das behaupten ja eine Menge Leute, und das sind nun wirklich keine Deppen, die das sagen. Warum gefällt mir diese Platte einfach nicht? Ich müsste sie mögen! Denn ihr Ansatz ist gut! Doch mit dem Anspruch muss sich eine Band auch zumuten, diesen musikalisch (und nicht nur konzeptionell) einzulösen. Zudem gibt es mehrere Beispiele (aber auch nicht viele), wo andere Formationen das sehr viel besser ausformuliert haben, wo wirklich etwas passiert, wo es Überraschungen gibt, wo man aus musikalischen Gründen den Mund aufmacht als Hörer... Eventuell habe ich gerade das falsche GYBE-Album gekauft. Zu viel Ehrfurcht vor dieser schwarzer Platte halte ich jedenfalls für grundlegend falsch. Wenn Sie wirklich etwas Unerhörtes kennenlernen wollen, ohne das weite Feld des Pop/Rock zu verlassen, dann holen Sie sich ""In Praise of Learning"" von Henry Cow. Besser wäre aber, sie wenden sich gleich den echten Pionieren zu, und die findet man nur im Bereich Klangkunst, Freie Improvisation oder in der Neuen Musik."
4,"Ray of light ist das erste wirklich gute Madonna Album seit Like A Prayer (1989).Die 1.Single ""Frozen"" brachte ihr sofort das Comeback in die Charts/eine gefühlvoll gesungene Ballade mit raffiniertem Groove und romantischer Streicherbegleitung.Die zweite Single ""Ray of light"" sowie der Albumtrack ""Skin"" sind zwei Dance-Kracher,die mit spaciger Atmosphäre und treibendem Beat überzeugen.Der ruhige Opener ""Drowned World"" stellt im dazugehörigen Video die Hetzjagd auf Lady Diana perfekt nach.Zu dem Dance Song""Sky fits heaven""lies sich die Pop Diva von Ihrem Klassiker Like A Prayer inspirieren.Ein atmosphärisch sehr dichtes,reichhaltiges Album,zwar voller Balladen,aber trotzdem mit viel Hitpotenzial!"
5,Danke Tilmann Otto für deine erstklassige Roots-Reggae-Musik! Das Album läuft bei mir täglich rauf und runter. Ich kanns kaum erwarten beim nächsten Auftritt in Wien dabei zu sein;-) Kann ich jeden nur empfehlen! Für jeden Gentleman-Fan ein ganz klares !!MUß ICH HABEN!!!
5,"Schon lange bin ich Echt-Fan,eigentlich von Anfang an(nein nein-ich bin wirklich kein Kreisch-Fan und ich schätze auch Tomte,Selig,Coldplay,...und nicht zuletzt auch guten deutschen Hip Hop),müsste die 5 Flensburger Jungs somit eigentlich auch gut kennen, aber dieses Album hat mich wirklich überrascht. Traumhafte Melodien(Stehengeblieben), feinste Rockmusik(Meisterwerk), lupenreiner Pop(WieGehtEsDirSo?), überzeugende Vocoder-Spielereien(Wahrheit) und sogar Bossa-Nova angehauchte Songs(DuBistNichtEcht.) machen dieses Album zu meinem Lieblingsalbum 2001. Die Band ist gereift, das hört man an jedem Song, denn zum einen hat man auf Fremdkompositionen verzichtet, man hat Abstand genommen vom Bombast des freischwimmer-Albums und auch die Bandmitglieder selbst sind an ihren Instrumenten versierter geworden. Kai Fischers Gitarrenriffs sind ausgefeilter, Flo Sump(Drums),Gunnar Astrup(Keyboards) und Andreas Puffpaff(Bass) haben sich an ihren Instrumenten verbessert und man muss zugeben, dass auch Sänger Kim Frank auf diesem Album komplett überzeugt-was man nicht zuletzt an &gt;DuBistNichtEcht.&lt; hören kann. Und falls man die Wahl hat-unbedingt die limited edition kaufen. Alle die behaupten,Echt könnten nicht rocken, werden beim Bonus-Track &gt;EsIstHier&lt; Lügen gestraft. Ihre wahren Qualitäten zeigen Echt jedoch live. Und dieses Potential hebt sie auch von ihren Nachahmern ab-oder spielte einer von denen bei Rock am Ring/Rock im Park und begeisterte jeweils über 10000 Menschen im Publikum? Zum Schluss kann also nur ein Zitat von Harald Schmidt kommen: ""Kaufen sie dieses Album!Sie werden es nicht bereuen."""
2,"...es gab schon Schlimmeres. Denkt doch nur mal an ""Panic Porky"" (Folge (6) der Serie ""Die Dr3i"") oder ""Der Mann ohne Kopf"". Aber ich muss mich meinen Vorrednern wirklich anschließen, denn die Story ist eigentlich keine Story. Manchmal ist weniger mehr. Ich muss aber sagen, dass die Stelle, an der Justus und seine Kollegen durch Kaffee geweckt werden, wirklich genial ist. ""Ich glaub mir werd' schlecht. Boaaahhhhh!"" Sehr gut. Nun wissen wir immerhin, dass Justus keinen Kaffee mag. Die tollen Sprecher können jedoch nicht über einen wirklich zu abstrusen Plot hinwegtäuschen.  Mich würde jedoch auch mal interessieren, ob die Handlung des Buches auch so verwirrend aufgebaut ist. Ansonsten bleibt mir nur zu sagen: Freuen wir uns einfach auf die nächste Folge (133) ""und der tote Mönch"". Klingt doch gleich viel spannender."
4,"""Zeitmaschine"" ist eine von Lindenbergs vielseitigsten Platten, so viel vorweg. Mit ""Freundeskreis"" arbeitet er im bisher von ihm nie genutzten Rap-/HipHop-Genre. Er bearbeitet wie oft zuvor wieder Klassiker der Musikgeschichte (""Einmal um die ganze Welt"", ""Fremde in der Nacht""). Und er würfelt vom Babelsberger Filmorchester begleitete Balladen (hervorragend: ""Verführung von Engeln"" nach Bertolt Brecht) mit rockigen Stücken aus der Werkstatt der Ströer-Brüder. Dabei legt er sehr viel Wert darauf, seinem eigenen Schaffen zu huldigen. Seinen alten Text zu ""No future"" verwendet er im ""Freundeskreis""-""Duett"" (auch als Musikvideo auf Viva zu sehen gewesen), ""Good Life City"" wird gecovert und die Melodie zum ""Old Procol Harum Record"" wird mit einem genial-melancholischen Text überlegt. Der Sternabzug meint lediglich, dass die CD für Lindenberg sicher nicht wegweisend ist und den Hörer auch anderweitig nicht vom Hocker reißen wird. Aber der Deutschrocker hat mit diesem Album eine starke, musikalisch sehr großflächige CD aufgenommen."
2,"Dieses Album habe ich mir nur gekauft weil mir der Song ""Heut Nacht"" schon damals so irre gut gefiel.Der Rest kann sich auch hören lassen.Ist zwar nichts für jeden Tag,aber den Kauf dieser CD bereut man auch nicht."
4,"Ich habe den Film am 6.12.2003 in Hamm angeschaut. Ich war von Anfang an begeistert, nicht nur weil Hugh Grant mitgespielt hat. Am besten fand ich die Szene mit ""Mr. Bean"", obwohl er mein ich im Film zu kurz kam.Er war sowas von komisch, wie er das Geschenk einpackte u. dann kam da noch ein bisschen was dazu, und da noch, es nahm einfach kein Ende. Echt witzig u. dann diese Mimik, Wahnsinn!Realitätsnah war auch die Szene, wo die Frau endlich den Mut gefunden hat ihren Kollegen, der natürlich super aussah, nach mehr als zwei Jahren ansprach. Wem passiert sowas nicht auchmal, zumal wenn man sich in jemanden verguckt hat? Und dass am selben Abend. es ist schon blöd u. man ärgert sich dann später, dass man sich nicht getraut hat. Die Songs, die während des Films gespielt wurden, summte ich unbewusst schon mit. Am besten gefallen mir die Lieder 1-4 u. 6-11 u. 14-18 also fast alle. Es lohnt sich auf jeden Fall!  4 Sterne, weil der Film sich an manchen Stellen ein wenig in die Länge zog u. Mr.Bean erst ab mitte zu sehen ist."
1,"Also ich höre schon seit über 6 Jahren Hip Hop/Rap.Aber das ist echt nicht nur schlecht.Alles kommerziell und billige Beats!!Eminem ist für mich nit nur schlecht,sondern Grottenschlecht!!!!!!Leute,die Ahnung von Hip Hop haben,hören da doch lieber:MC Eiht,Eazy E,Bone Thugs N Harmony um nur einige zu nennen!!! Nicht so was...... Aber is ja Geschmackssache..."
5,"Martialisch präsentiert das Cover den Bolschewiken mit blutrotem Wams und Budjonny-Mütze in „I want you for army“-Geste, „Subbotnik“ nennt sich der Tonträger, nach dem Begriff der ungeliebten „freiwilligen“ Samstag-Arbeitseinsätze in der SU und später in der DDR – bietet diese CD unsägliche verordnete Agitpropgesänge? Der Liedpoet Wenzel, der Liebedienerei realsozialistischer Kulturpolitik sicherlich unverdächtig, kommentiert im Begleitheft: „Hüten wir uns . . . vor schnellen, gängig-griffigen Bewertungen, ideologischen Vor- und Nachurteilen . . . Denn was wir zu kennen glauben, verschließen wir unserem Interesse.“  Wirft man einen Blick auf die Titel der CD, so fällt einem die bunte Mischung auf: das freche „Ca ira“ stammt noch aus den Tagen der Französischen Revolution von 1789, „Da geht ein Kämpfer“ stammt aus Griechenland, „Helle Wasser, dunkle Wälder“ aus Finnland, das dramatische „Hasta siempre commandante“ besingt Che Guevara . Gar nicht kämpferisch erklingen die schottische „Taube“ und „Lowlands“, ebensowenig das russische „Kolokoltschik“ (nicht das schon zum Überdruß auf unzähligen Tonträgern mit russischer Folklore bemühte Traditional, sondern ein sehr schönes kaum bekanntes Liebeslied). Mehr Pathos wird in „Budjonnys Reiterlied“ gelegt, das die Tage des blutigen Bürgerkriegs beschwört; auch wenn die Friedenswacht der Sowjetarmee besungen wird, fehlt sinnbildlich nicht das entschlossen vorgestreckte Kinn der Oktoberklubler; umso trefflicher lassen sich die Lieder mitschmettern, wenn man erstmal den Text draufhat! Den belehrenden Zeigefinger erspart uns nicht „Nach dieser Erde“, nun ja. „Theaterposen manchmal, Kostüme, um über die bornierte Realität hinwegzukommen. Die löbliche Absicht steht außer Frage. Auch wenn einige neuerliche Geschichtsforscher gern den Beweis hätten, daß in der DDR nur unter Zwang und Folter gesungen wurde!“, meint Wenzel, und hofft, dass dereinst die Enkelkinder beim Anhören dieser Aufnahmen sagen werden: “Erstaunlich, wie wenig egoistisch diese Leute damals waren!“ Eigentlich ist zu hoffen, dass sie´s nicht sagen. Sondern den gleichen Idealismus an den Tag legen.  Das bekannte „Bürgerlied“ aus dem Vormärz, hier in einer neckisch erneuerten Version („ob uns Brüste vorne schmücken oder ob wir gern sie drücken, das tut nichts dazu“), ist in seinem Appell an den Gemeinsinn gerade heute aktueller denn je. Oktoberklub, das ist mehr als DDR-Musikgeschichte. Das ist Musik, die man immer noch hören, genießen, mitsingen kann."
1,"Das Booklet zerschnitten, die letzten drei Titel laufen nur mono, einen sehr guten Zustand stelle ich mir anders vor!"
5,"LeTour 3 ist, in der Tat, wie im Booklet angekündigt, der beste Sampler aus dieser Reihe. Entdeckungen sind die mir nicht bekannten La Position Du Tireur Couchè (Gainsbourg!!!!), La Rue Ketanou (da geht die Post ab!), Dobacaracol (hat da Manu Chao mitgemischt??)  und diese trägen Lovers. Ganz zu schweigen von Emilie Simon, Anais, Olivia Ruiz und der göttlichen Pauline Croze. Cali und Dionysos kennen wir schon von den ersten beiden Samplern, Florent Pagnys ""Ma liberté de penser"" ein Ohrwurm und Sinsemilia ein Riesehit."
5,"Coralie Clement, ihres Zeichens Schwester des französischen Chansonstars Benjamin Biolay, hat das vorliegende Album bereits 2001 eingespielt. Und fast so, als sollten die Songs noch etwas reifen, kommt man in Deutschland erst jetzt in den Genuss einer Veröffentlichung.  'Salle des pas perdus' bietet 13 mit Bossanova und Jazz gewürzte verführerische Chansons, in denen Coralie nicht durch große Sangeskunst, sondern vielmehr durch lasziv gehauchten Sprechgesang glänzt. Mit dem rauchigen Timbre von beispielsweise Carla Bruni kann man die Gesangsdarbietungen einer Coralie Clement nicht vergleichen - Coralie säuselt manchmal kaum wahrnehmbar flüsternd und zerbrechlich-zart ins Mikro. Die Songs und Melodien (für die übrigens Bruder Benjamin verantwortlich ist) sind passend dazu leicht federnd, luftig beschwingt und wickeln den Hörer mit sanfter Eleganz und einem charmanten Hauch von Erotik um den Finger. 'Salle des pas perdus' ist insgesamt ein rundum feines Chanson-Album mit wunderschönen Songs und frühlingshafter Musik zum absoluten Wohlfühlen und Entspannen."
2,"Dem aufmerksamen Zuhörer (und Musikkenner) wird es sofort aufallen: hab ich das bei Linkin Park nicht schon besser gehört? Der Aufbau der Lieder (leise Strophe, lauter Refrain; typisch für Nu-Metal bzw. Linkin Park) zeigt es deutlich, zudem ist alles nochmal einen ordentlichen Tick softer als bei den Kollegen. Auch textlich wird die Klasse nicht erreicht, hätte auch Fred Durst schreiben können. Man darf also keine lyrischen Meisterwerke erwarten! Wirkt alles in allem ziemlich zusammengeklaut, auch wenn Jared Leto als Sänger keine schlechte Figur macht!"
1,"Die Musik mag ja ein tolles Gefühl vermitteln, die Sprache ist einfach eine Katstrophe - das ist Pidgin-Spanisch der übelsten Sorte. Hier sollte sich mal die Königliche Akademie der Spanischen Sprache einschalten und der Verhunzung der spanischen Sprache einen Riegel vorschieben. Für alle Zweifler: Guckt mal auf die Homepage von Marquess ins Forum, da gibt es Meldungen von Spanisch-Muttersprachlern - denen müssten die Jungs von Marqués - so heisst das auf Spanisch richtig - Schmerzensgeld zahlen. Es lebe die PISA-Studie - wer schon kein Deutsch gelernt hat, faselt auf Spanisch und stürmt die Charts. Ein Trauerspiel."
1,"Leider wurden für diese einfallslose Zusammenstellung wieder die Hits gewählt, die man schon im Radio, im TV oder auf anderen Best-Of-CD`s rauf und runter gehört hat. Mit 66 Jahren, aber bitte mit Sahne, tralala... Vielleicht wäre es ja mal an der Zeit gewesen, die teilweise sehr guten und anspruchsvolleren Hits aus der ""Zweiten Reihe"" zu wählen, auch wenn diese nicht auf Platz 1 oder 2 der Charts landeten. O.k., dann hätte man diese Scheibe anders benennen müssen, vielleicht ""seine besten Songs"" oder so ähnlich. Udo hat mehr drauf als auf dieser lieblos zusammengestellten CD zu hören ist... Hinzu kommt, dass viele Songs nicht in der Originalaufnahme aufgespielt wurden - für Fans ist diese CD nix...Finger weg..."
2,"Zu den Audio-Tracks wurde hier ja schon Lob und auch Kritik geäußert. Ich finde sie durchweg zu langweilig und man hört nicht mehr den gewohnten Wu-Style der ersten Alben (bis einschl. Wu-Tang Forever). Danach ging es nur noch abwärts.  Bei diesem Album hört man noch die ein oder anderen guten Einfälle (Track1 - Campfire, Track7, Track10, Track11, Track15), überwiegend herrscht aber Einfallslosigkeit (Track5 - Unpredictable) und einfach nur Langeweile (Track6 - The Heart Gently Weeps, Track8, Track9). RZA ist bekanntlich das Herz des Clans aber diese Scheibe hört sich zu sehr nach seiner Federführung an (Track12 - Windmill, Track9 - Sunlight), die sehr an Bobby Digital erinnern. Aber die größte Enttäuschung ist die beiliegende DVD: absolut schlechtes Live-Material, welches teilweise mit Studioaufnahmen übertönt wird, und uninteressante Interviews.  Fazit: Die CD ist eine Abwechslung zu dem Pimp-HipHop-Möchtegern-Gangsta-Rap der letzten Jahre und macht Lust, die alten Alben wieder anzuhören. Mehr leider nicht. Die DVD ist ein schlechtes Werbevideo zu 8 Diagrams und kann vernachlässigt werden. Mehr als 2 Sterne gibt's dafür nicht."
1,"Ach, Bestes Album? Das schreiben nur Leute die kein Plan haben!!! Denn es hat weder gute Beats noch Lyrics! Wu Tang hat den alten Flavor längst verloren! An der Eastcoast herrschen Nas, Jay-Z, DMX, Ja Rule, ... und im Süden Master P, Juvenile, Three 6 Mafia, ... im Midwest Eminem, Lil Bow Wow und Nelly und an der WestCoast Dr.Dre, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, Mack 10... Wu Tang kommen aus New York und haben dort seit Jahren nix mehr zu melden, nur in Europa sind sie erfolgreich! Platin, OK, das war gut, aber nur wegen 2 Songs! Master P's MP Da Last Don 4x Platin, oder wenn ihr harte Rap Gruppen hören wollt: THREE 6 MAFIA, aber auf Iron Flag kann ich kaum einen guten Song finden, und wenn ich es mir 1000x anhöre, immer noch nix!!! Wer was von Rap versteht wird sich neue Alben von Master P, Three 6 Mafia, Nas oder Mack 10 holen! Peace"
1,"Eko und Bushido haben mal wieder einen Song zusammen aufgenommen. Das wäre an sich garnicht so schlimm, wenn beide wenigstens ein bisschen Talent mitbringen würden. Aber nein hier haben wir es mit zwei Mainstream Prostituierten zu tun, die mainstreamiger nicht sein könnten. Der eine spielt den absolut harten Ghetto Gangsta und der andere kopiert dieses billige Image auch noch. Wenn ich das so sehe, frage ich mich, ob diese Leute eigentlich eine eigene Identität besitzen. Schließlich handelt es sich doch hier um zwei ""mehr oder weniger"" Erwachsene Menschen. Oder Irre ich mich da? Am schlimmsten finde ich jedoch den Fakt, dass mit dieser wirklich billigen Nummer, das Image des HipHop's wieder ein Stück mehr in den Dreck gezogen wird. Was mich aber am meisten beunruihigt, ist die traurige Tatsache, dass Eko versucht 2Pac zu kopieren. Schon dafür gehört der Junge in den Knast. Und das am besten Lebenslänglich. Ich kann nur hoffen, dass dieser ganze Aggro, EGJ, etc. Kram in der nächsten Zeit endlich aus den Medien verschwindet. Denn so langsam wird es echt immer peinlicher und niveauloser. Fazit: Dieser Müll hat nichts mit dem HipHop zu tun, der in den Siebziger Jahren in New York entstanden ist. Das hier ist höchstens für kleine Kiddies, die ihre Hoße in den Socken haben."
1,"Ich hör schon sehr lange Ersguterjunge und muss sagen, was sie veröffentlichen ist immer auf einem sehr hohen Level. Nur Saad ist der einzige wo dort irgendwie nicht reinpasst und vom Style aus der Reihe tanzt. Er ist einfach auf der Strecke geblieben. Das Album wirkt altmodisch und sehr deprimierend. Also ich hätte erwartet das er nach dem Album ""Das Leben ist Saad"", mal was richtig gutes macht. Und was ist draus geworden. Ich glaub er hat keine Lust noch was überragend gutes zu machen. Auf den Samplern wirkt er motivierter und aggressiver. Sein Problem ist er kann kein geiles Album machen, er ist einfach nicht in der Lage sowas zu machen, das merkt man. Daher gefällt mir das Album auch nicht. Der Track ""Regen"" ist das einzige wo mir gefällt und ""Was willst du machen?"", wobei ich sagen muss das ich Bizzy Montanas Strophe nur gut finde. Also kauft euch das Album lieber nicht."
2,"Ich habe diese cd nicht gekauft, und ich habe mich entschieden sie auch nicht zu kaufen; seit dem ich gesehen habe, welche tracks drauf sind. ich finde es fehlt z.b. ""wenn wir kommen"" oder ""schmetterling"". Felix"
5,"Es hat etwas gedauert, bis ""Innere Sicherheit"", das dritte von bisher vier Studioalben vom Mindener Rapper Curse, wirklich bei den Fans ankam. Es ist ein experimentelles, durchaus gewagtes und innovatives Album, auf das man sich erst einmal einlassen muss. Je länger man die Scheibe besitzt, desto deutlicher erkennt man aber den unglaublichen Wert der CD. Den einzelnen Stücken lassen sich auch nach Monaten und Jahren noch neue Facetten abgewinnen, da sie unglaublich vielfältig und komplex sind. Das ist sicher auch der kreativen Machart der CD zu verdanken: Curse setzt als einer von wenigen Rappern statt auf Synthie-Beats aus dem Computer auf eine Vielfalt von Instrumenten, was sicher ein Risiko ist, sich hier aber definitiv auszahlt. Es erhöht deutlich die ""Lebensdauer"" der Stücke, macht sie fast schon zeitlos und damit hebt sich ""Innere Sicherheit"" ziemlich krass von anderen Alben ab - aber im positiven Sinne.  Als Beispiele für das Gelingen dieses Unterfangens lassen sich viele Songs auf ""Innere Sicherheit"" aufzählen: Der Opener ""Alles Wird Besser"", der von knackigen Bläsern grandios in seiner Aussage unterstützt wird. Dieses aufbruchartige, optimistische, kraftvolle kommt somit perfekt zur Geltung. Es zeichnet Curse aus, dass er für jede Textidee die dazu passende Instrumentierung wählt - somit werden die inhaltichen Effekte verstärkt und alles wirkt optimal aufeinander abgestimmt. Auch bei ""Ich Versteh Dich"" fügt in diesem Fall die Querflöte nochmal ein gewisses Extra zu den von Liebe handelnden Lyrics hinzu. Das gleiche gilt natürlich auch für ""Und Was Ist Jetzt"", wohl eines der besten deutschen Rapsongs aller Zeiten. Genauso genial wie die Instrumentierung ist dabei der Flow von Curse: Durch die verschiedenen Emotionen, die er in seine Stimme legt, kann er die vom Song erzeugte Gefühlslage von Resignation, Enttäuschung, Verzweiflung und Trauer zu Wut, Hass und Trotz wandeln. So etwas ist bislang keinem anderen Rapper Deutschlands dermaßen gut gelungen. Es klingt - wie wahrscheinlich der Rest der Rezension auch - bestimmt unglaublich unkritisch, aber damit hat Curse wohl einen Song für die Ewigkeit geschrieben.  Es finden sich noch einige weitere echte Perlen auf ""Innere Sicherheit"", ob ""Widerstand"", ""Gleichgewicht"", ""Goldene Zeiten"" oder ""Rap"". Manchmal erschließt sich die Qualität einiger Stücke zugegebenermaßen erst nach einer Weile, aber das zeichnet einen echten Klassiker aus: Die Langlebig- und Vielschichtigkeit. Curse musste für dieses Album durchaus Prügel einstecken. Ich war mir zwar immer sicher, dass es sich um ein gutes Album handelte, aber es dauerte auch bei mir einige Zeit, bis es für mich das mittlerweile sogar beste Curse-Album wurde und eines der besten Rap-Alben generell. Man muss sich mit ""Innere Sicherheit"" ein bisschen beschäftigen. Da mit sovielen Instrumenten und Stilrichtungen experimentiert wird, könnte man annehmen, dass eine etwas zusammengewürfelte, zusammenhangslose und unharmonische Ansammlung von sperrigen Liedern herauskommen würde, doch das ist definitiv nicht der Fall, besonders wenn man sich einmal für längere Zeit auf das Album eingelassen hat. Daher ist ""Innere Sicherheit"" für mich zu einem absoluten Klassiker geworden, dass gleichzeitig mit seinem Stil eine absolute Rarität darstellt. Und deswegen empfehle ich jedem Genießer von deutschem Rap, ""Innere Sicherheit"" eine Chance zu geben."
2,"Ich bin vom Album enttäuscht, hätte mir von Eko mehr erwartet."
1,"Eko der neue Untergang des deutschen Raps!!! Warum ist er nicht bei Savas geblieben, das hätte uns ein mieses Album erspart. Dass er rappen kann hat man auf den Tracks mit Savas bereits gemerkt. Aber was er hier abliefert is einfach nicht real. Ein typisches Kommerzprodukt. Einziges Lob für die Features von Caput und Summer Cem, die tight rappen und einen schlechten Rapper wie Eko nicht verdient haben. Trotzdem wollen wir hoffen dass er wieder mit Savas zusammenkommt und uns so wieder ein paar tighte Tracks bringt."
5,"Jeder, der behauptet, dass das Album nicht super ist, lügt. Natürlich gibt es etwas wie ""Geschmackssache"". Ich gehe davon aus, dass die Leute die harten Rap hören davon begeistert sein werden. Punchlines fliegen nur so rum:) Für mich definitiv das beste Album des Jahres 2008 :)"
2,"Leider, leider ist diese Ausgabe ebenso enttäuschend, wie die von The Mix: Spring 2009. Es fehlen hier einfach die Highlights. Einigermaßen interessante Tracks wechseln sich mit Tracks ab, bei denen die Hörnerven echt strapaziert werden und man eigentlich nur noch die Taste zum Überspringen wählen kann. Alles in Allem stagnieren die Veröffentlichungen. Ich bin nun mal auf den Summer Sampler 2009 und die Ausgabe der Beach House Reihe gespannt und hoffe auf Besserung."
2,"Während Prodigy im Gefängnis genug Zeit hat Texte für neue Alben zu schreiben, vertreiben wir und die Labels sich die Zeit damit, alte, unveröffentlichte Tracks auf den Markt zu werfen, bzw. zu hören. Und hier kommt eine DOPPEL CD die verspricht, das ""Ultimative"" von Prodigy zu bringen. Sicher nicht, denn wenn wir die ganzen Skits und Interludes abziehen, haben wir zwar noch immer viele Tracks, aber auch hier sind wieder Left-Overs am Start, die den Sprung auf die richtigen Releases nicht geschafft haben. Sicher aber von daher, dass ein schöner Querschnitt durch seine bisherige Karriere gezogen wird. Von den Mobb Anfängen, über die G-Unit Phase bis hin zu den Solos.... Prodigy und Havoc funktioneren nur als Team, und nur wenn Sie topmotivert an die Arbeit gehen! Zumindest sind hier viele alte Tracks dabei ( man hört es an den Lyrics ) und auch nennenswerte Gäste ( MOP,50CENT,KOKANE,YOUNG BUCK,TRAGEDY KHADAFI) Der Track mit TRAGEDY ( The Code Part II ) zählt zu den wenigen Standouts! Das Gesamtwerk würde ich als ""Grimy und Rau"" bezeichnen, richtige Highlights fehlen aber leider........man sollte da lieber auf ProdigyŽs letztes Album -Product of the 80s- zurückgreifen, auch hier hat er zwei derbe Sounderlebnisse mit Partner in Rhyme TWIN GAMBINO am Start - tighter Shit straight aus der Geisterbahn :)"
1,"Wenn ich JaRule höre denk ich immer an das junge publikum in den Clubs. Die Jungs mit ihren Knitterhemden und dem Brad Pitt in sich,und die Mädels mit ihrem J-Lo gehabe. Die Ärmel werden wieder geknickt hin und her geschaukelt, während JaRules Tracks laufen. Ich könnte mich totlachen wenn ich die häßlichen E36er BMW's an mir vorbeifahren sehe und es ertönt ganz laut JaRule aus den Boxen und die Jungs und Mädels versuchen damit HIP-HOP zu interpretieren. Geh bitte..sag niemend das du hier warst ....! genug gefaked ! Chartbreaker-Musik ist meine Meinung !"
5,Eins der besten Alben von KKS bzw. Optik. Auf jeden Fall ein würdiger Abschluss für OR.
5,"was soll man sagen? das album ist mal wieder der absolute burner und so komplett anders als das was man sonst hört. zurück zu den guten, alten tugenden, die der szene abhanden gekommen sind.  der retrogott besticht mal wieder mit seinem reflektierten, intelligenten, anti-alles rap. dazu kommt die exquisite sample-auswahl sowie die feinen cuts. so langsam machen mir die jungs angst. da bahnt sich was großes an."
1,Deluxe soundsystem war noch fett das 2001 album ging auch noch aber jetzt ist er voll am stinken genau so wie asd. Samy hats nicht mehr drauf. Das lächerliche ist das er es ständig mit us-beats versucht die die tracks noch vollkommen runieren. Er sollte nur mit Leuten wie dynamite und Tropf arbeiten. Lieber digger dance hohlen die sind eben noch digg.
5,"Dieses Album gehört zu den besten, die ich mir je gekauft habe. Warum? Weil einfach für jeden und jede Stimmung etwas dabei ist. Es sind einige ruhigere Tracks drauf, aber auch einige ""aggressivere"". Wenn man dazu noch bedenkt, dass Manuellsen nie wieder rappen wird, sollte man sich dieses Album auf jeden Fall holen."
2,"Diese Album hat mich nich wirklich überzeugt und kann weder mit Banks ""Hunger For More"" , noch mit Fiddys ""Massacre"" mithalten.Die Beats sind eintönig und schlecht.Schlicht langweilig.Ich habe mir zuerst YBs neueres Werk ""Buck The World"" gekauft und war hellauf begeistert, jedoch nach dem anhören dieses Album sehr enttäuscht.... Natürlich hängt die Beurteilung der Lieder auch vom Musikgeschmack des Käufers ab, dennoch kann ich vom Kauf des Albums nur abraten..... Auch wenn Buck als MC sehr begabt is und seine Lyrics nicht schlecht sind, wenn der Beat schlecht is kann ich mir den Track nich anhören..... Deshalb empfehle ich gleich ""Buck The World"" zu kaufen, da dieses Album der Hammmer is und wirklich mehr als 2 mal so gut wie ""Straight outta...."" 2*"
2,"So sehr mich Fräulein Catterfeld mit ""Für Dich"" überrascht hat, so sehr hat sie mich mit dieser Single enttäuscht. In ""Du hast mein Herz gebrochen"" steckt kein bisschen Neuheit, keine Inovativität."
1,"Ich weiß, dass Helene eine ganz liebe ist. Trotzdem wird sie vom MDR total hochgepuscht. Mit der Meinung stehe ich leider nicht alleine da, denn es denken viele so. Ich gönne ihr ja den Erfolg. Nur ist es momentan sehr viel für sie. Hoffentlich endet sie mal nicht so wie Michelle auf der Bühne. Hoffentlich hat das alles bald ein Ende und es wird bald mal bissel weniger Ruhm um sie gemacht.  Außerdem finde ich ihre Musik ziemlich langweilig, weil jedes zweite Lied gleich klingt. Das gleiche Ebenbild wie bei Andrea Berg. Wenn man 1 Lied kennt, kennt man alle anderen Songs auch."
5,"Ja, da hat die Susanne mal wieder was GANZ feines ""rausgehauen""!!!!!! Was anderes kann man dazu echt nicht sagen. Alle Titel einfach genial!!!! Ich will MEHR ;-))"
5,"Ja - der Anteil ""echter Superhits"" fällt bei der dritten CD des Triumvirats vielleicht etwas niedriger aus - aber was heißt das schon??? auch hier finden wir wieder eine wahre Leistungsschau einer ""Songwriterschule der Superlative"" - Qualität, die man im deutschsprachigen Kulturkreis sonst wirklich lange suchen kann! ...und je weniger einem die Lieder schon vorher bekannt waren, desto länger hat man dann seine Freude dran! Der ""Abnutzungseffekt"" ist daher bei Vol. 3 besonders niedrig! Mein Tipp: Versandkosten sparen - früher oder später will man eh alle drei haben!!!"
5,"Dieses Album umfasst die schönsten und erfolgreichsten Songs von Céline Dion!  Als Bonus gibt es dann noch My Love in der Live-Version - was wirklich atemberaubend ist! Insbesondere für diejenigen, die die Chance genutzt haben und Céline auf Ihren Konzerten besucht haben! My Love ist einer der gefühlvollsten und persönlichsten Songs ihrer kompletten Karriere!  Einen neuen Song gibt es auch zu hören: There Comes A Time! Auch dieser Song gliedert sich bedenkenlos in Ihre Top-Hits ein. Mit Militär-Trommel im Hintergrund wirkt er gerade für Céline völlig neu und verleiht (zumindest bei mir) die passende Stimmung für die aktuelle Jahreszeit... Ebenso gönnt man uns eine neue Version von Love Can Move Mountains! Hab ich zwar noch nicht gehört, aber wir können von Céline bestimmt eine stilvolle Neuauflage erwarten! Ich freu mich darauf! Insgesamt gesehen ist dieses Album Célines erstes richtiges Best-Of bzw. Greatest Hits Album und somit ein unbedingtes muss für Fans. Auch als Nicht-Fan hat man hier seine Freude: Man hat alles Songs zusammen, die man von Ihr kennt bzw. kennen sollte. Die komplette Spannweite wird hier aufgespielt.  All The Way war nur ein kleines und unvollständiges Best-Of Album - hier hat man alles drauf was glücklich macht! Deswegen: Unbedingt kaufen!"
2,"Habe mir leider die CD gekauft, sie gefällt mir überhaupt nicht die 2007/2006 A State of Trance wahren viel besser von den Beats und von der Trance Tracks auswahl! Nur bedingt empfehlens wert Grüße"
4,"Mit ""Tambu"" kommen Toto erstmals mit ihrem neuen Weltklasse-Drummer Simon Philipps daher, der für die verstorbenen Toto-Legende Jeffrey Porcaro eingesprungen ist. Im Grunde konnte auch kein anderer als er in die Fußspuren seinen Vorgängers treten. Jedenfalls kann er sich hervorragend in das Niveau der Band einfügen. Was das Songwriting angeht, ist ""Tambu"" sicherlich kein Meilenstein der Musikgeschichte, ein richter Ohrwurm der Marke ""Hold the line"", ""Africa"" oder ""How many times"" sucht man vergeblich. Dennoch finden sich gute bis sehr gute Songs auf dem Album, doch sind Stücke wie ""Gift of faith"" und die schönen Balladen ""Just can't get to you"" und ""Other end of time"" ziemlich eingängig. ""Drag him to the roof"" zwingt zum Mitwippen, wenngleich Sänger Lukather beim Refrain nicht die nötige Power rüberbringt. Davon abgesehen stecken Toto auf instrumentaler Ebene jede andere Rockband locker in die Tasche, was sie auch gerade auf ""Tambu"" wieder beweisen. Ein Highlight der CD ist für mich daher auch das Instrumentalstück ""Dave's gone skiing"". Wenn das Stück vorbei ist, fühlt man sich richtig erschlagen und überwältigt, ganz besonders von Simon Philipps gigantischem Spiel, das seinesgleichen sucht."
1,"Ich gebe zu, dass ich über die Single-Auskopplungen auf diese Truppe gekommen bin. Nun bin ich schwer enttäuscht, nicht etwa, weil der Rest der Scheibe so anders ist, nein, weil alles auf dieser Scheibe an fehlender Klangtiefe leidet. Klingt so, als hätte einer die BEPs schlecht remixt mit doofen Samples, lahmen Beats und zahnlosen Percussions. Was soll das??? Das ist so etwa, wie wenn Daimler mit ner Nobelkarosse wirbt und einem dann nen Skoda verkauft. Thats it, werd wohl nix mehr von denen kaufen."
2,"Der Großmeister des eingängigen Latinpops, der in den 60/70ern mit Coverversionen bekannt wurde, bekommt sein neues Album vom derzeitigen Großmeister des eingängigen HipHops - Will.i.am von den Black Eyed Peas - produziert. Und der Auftakt dieses Albums voller Coverversionen war auch gleich der größte Erfolg (Jorge Bens ""Mas Que Nada"") Mendes`. Doch bei aller Vorfreude über die Koordinaten dieses Albums: Sergio Mendes himself, die Black Eyed Peas an der Seite und daneben noch Gastmusiker Stevie Wonder (nur an der Mundharmonika), Erykah Badu, Justin Timberlake, Jill Scott, Q-Tip oder Mr. Vegas. Das Ergebnis ist enttäuschend. Denn es ist ein Black Eyed Peas Album geworden, hier wie dort wird über Melodiefragmente ein dicker Beat gelegt und nach spätestens einer Minute labert (rappt) irgend jemand in den Song. Das zerstört die schönen Melodien, den ansonsten flauschigen Soundteppich inkl. der typischen weiblichen Backgroundstimmen sowie den Flow an sich. Die besten Songs sind dem gemäß diejenigen, bei denen sich die Rapper/Toaster zurück halten. Da hätte man aber viel mehr daraus machen können."
4,"Mit ihrem neuen Album haben After Forever sicher einen weiteren Schritt nach vorne gemacht - bombastischer, grösser, besser. Die Songs kommen abwechslungsreicher daher als die des Vorgängers ""Remagine"". Dort waren mir ein paar SOngs zu ähnlich, auf dem neuen ALbum aber hat jedes Lied wieder seine ganz eigene Note. Obwohl ihr zweites ALbum, ""Decipher"", nach wie vor mein Favorit bleibt (nachdem Mark Janssen die Band nach dem zweiten Album verlassen hat, ging meiner Meinung nach ein kleines Stückchen Magie verloren...), gibts an diesem Werk nicht viel auszusetzen. Schon die ersten 30 Sekunden machen einem klar, dass man sich auf ein bombastischen Werk gefasst machen darf. Dass ""Energize Me"" eindeutig das Lied ist, das sich am besten für die Charts eignet, tut dem mitreissenden Song keine Abbruch. Der Bonustrack, ""Lonely"", vermag mich nicht ganz zu überzeugen. Ich weiss, es ist eine Ballade, aber das Lied fiel für mich dann doch zuuu seicht aus, wie schon ""Strong"" auf dem Vorgänger.  Floors Stimme ist wieder einmal umwerfend, obwohl sie meiner Ansicht nach nicht ganz so viel zeigt wie zum Teil in ""Remagine"" (--&gt; man höre sich ""Forever"" und den Refrain von ""Free of doubt"" an). Allerdings kann man bei ihr kaum sagen, ob sie nun mehr oder weniger von ihrem Können zeigt, weil ihre Stimme so etwas von unglaublich variabel ist - mal aggressiv, mal tief, mal hoch, mal stark an Tarja Turunen erinnernd, mal umwerfend kraftvoll, dann wieder sanft.  Obwohl es auf dem Vorgänger einige Lieder gibt, die ich ununterbrochen hören könnte, gefällt mir dieses Album insofern besser, dass es abwechslungreicher und auch wieder anspruchsvoller daher kommt. Einige Lieder muss man sich mehrere Male anhören, um sie wirklich mögen zu können. Dann aber wird klar, wie viel in jedem Lied drinsteckt - Lyrics, Orchester, Gitarren, Grunts, FLoors Stimme, Chor, alles passt perfekt zusammen."
5,"Sepultura spielten sich mit dieser Scheibe in die obere Liga des Metals, ganz klar. Musiktechnisch gibt es hier rohe, unverbrauchte Musik mit hoher Geschwindigkeit und Härte. Und dazu ein junger Max Cavalera, der giftiger nicht singen könnte. Was Sepultura aber von vielen anderen Metal-Bands dieser Zeit unterschied (und auch heute noch) sind die Texte, bei denen man meint, dass sie im Metal eher eine geringere Rolle spielen. Denn statt über das übliche belanglose Zeug wie ""Satan"",""Kill"" oder ""Stahl"" zu singen befasste man sich eher kritisch mit korrupter Politik, Massengehirnwäsche und Sozialkritik. Eben dies macht die Band auch aus. Dieses Album gehört in jede anständige Hartwurstsammlung! Zu den Bonustracks sei gesagt, diese sind sicherlich Geschmackssache und nicht wirklich wichtig, denn vor allem die ursprünglichen 9 Lieder zählen."
2,"Der Technik muß man zweifellos Bewunderung zollen, aber ist Höhe wirklich alles? Zugegeben, so präzise und mühelos schafft derzeit sicher niemand diese schwindelnden Höhen und Koloraturen, aber die Schönheit des Klanges bleibt zu großen Teilen trotzdem auf der Strecke.Besonders die Vendetta-Schreie aus Rossinis Turca jagen mir Schauer des Grauens über den Rücken. Das kann doch niemand schön finden, oder?! Dazu kommt noch, daß die meisten Opern ja nur zum geringsten Teil aus Spitzentönen und Koloraturen bestehen und in der Mittellage hat der junge Mann halt gar nicht viel zu bieten. Obwohl man sich manchmal wünschen würde, er würde nicht wieder so steil nach oben klettern, ist man dann, wenn er es tut, auch wieder enttäuscht. Die Stimme ist über große Strecken ausdrucksarm, wie Juan Diego Flórez ja auch auf der Bühne eher ausdruckslos und ohne Bewegungstalent agiert. Für mich ist diese CD zwar ein ""Zeitzeuge"", sonst aber nicht weiter empfehlenswert. Schade um diese Gelegenheit!"
4,"Auf dieser schon vor einiger Zeit erschienenen aber bis vor kurzem nur als Import erhältlichen Platte, deutet sich schon der heutige, gerade auch von Brant Bjorks Schlagzeugspiel geprägte Charakter von Fu Manchu an.Die Songs sind nicht mehr ganz so Gras-verhangen wie auf den Platten davor und es wird schon der Weg zu straightem Rock angedeutet. Insgesamt noch nicht der Rock-Faktor von California Crossing aber auf jeden Fall hörenswert!"
1,"Irgendwo habe ich mal folgenden Kommentar über die Musik von Glasvegas gelesen: ""Boring, really ordinary!"". Treffender kann man es kaum formulieren. Kitschiges und naiv-harmloses Songwriting der 60er Jahre, unerträglich schmalziger Gesang und eine vollkommen aufgesetzte Coolness mancher (vor allem weiblicher) Bandmitglieder machen diese Band zu einem Klon der von Dieter Bohlen und Co. zum Zwecke der schnellen Geldbeschaffung in Szene gesetzten Casting-Produkte. So ist es auch nicht verwunderlich, dass Glasvegas vieles, was mir persönlich schon immer auf den Wecker geht, in sich zusammen vereinen wie z.B. Coldplay oder (die frühen) U2. Ja, mit solch einer Musik kann man kommerzielle Erfolge feiern, allerdings ist das noch nie (vielleicht sogar mit am wenigsten) ein Indikator für gute und anspruchsvolle Musik gewesen.  Um mit einem weiteren Zitat dies hier zu beenden: ""Diese Musik erzeugt genau eine Atmosphäre - ein Kakaoatmosphäre!"". Treffender kann man es kaum formulieren..."
1,"selten ein derart verkrampft eingespieltes Werk gehört. Nach den letzten beiden wirklich guten Scheiben ist mit ""Get Behind Me Satan"" mein Grundvertrauen in die White Stripes schwer entäuscht worden - leider gekauft, ohne vorher zu hören. Die Musik plätschert irgendwo im Nirvana von Folk und Pop und Tralala, der Gesang ist teilweise eine schlechte Kopie von Prince (!)- klingt, als wenn die Beiden mit reichlich zu viel Alk und Gras im Kopf möglichst schräg und langweilig klingen wollten. Das ist ihnen wirklich gelungen... Klare Weglass-Scheibe!"
5,"Bisher hatte ich mit Tabaluga nichts am Hut (oder um die Ohren, besser gesagt ;-). Aber dieser Bann ist nun gebrochen."
1,"Wie hatte ich mich auf die Hörspiel-Umsetzung von DSA gefreut - seit der Ankündigung fieberte ich dem Release entgegen...  ... und nun das!  Die Hörspiele klingen billig produziert, einige Sprecher sind ok, einige aber auch schlecht. Die Musik, für die Atmosphäre enorm wichtig, ist absolut FURCHTBAR - billiges Synthie-Gequietsche und nervige Melodien statt einer orchestralen und ansprechenden Untermalung. Aber mit all dem könnte ich noch leben, wenn denn wenigstens die Geschichten harmonisch zum Schwarzen Auge passen würden. Leider klingt es jedoch so, als hätten die Macher versucht, depperten Anime / Pokemon-Humor einzubauen und das Ganze für depile Achtjährige anzupassen (ich erinnere mich noch mit Grausen an die peinliche Szene, in der die ""Helden"" sich ihre ""Kampfnamen"" geben; oder die mit dem ""Taschendrachen"" - schrecklich!).  Andererseits sind einige Teile der Handlung dann wieder für Kinder bis 12 Jahre (wenn diese denn neuerdings die Zielgruppe von DSA sein sollen?!?) viel zu brutal - wie passt das zusammen? Mit der eigentlich Welt von Aventurien, wie man sie aus unzähligen Büchern und Abenteuern kennt, hat das leider absolut nichts zu tun. Wenn es nicht so groß auf dem Cover stünde, könnte ich kaum glauben, hier ein DSA-Produkt vor mir zu haben... :(    Wie toll hätte DSA als Hörspiel sein könnnen - man müsste nur einge der guten Romane (zB die Greifenfurt-Trilogie) nehmen und sie mit der Hörspiel-Qualität von Drizzt, Perry Rhodan oder der Edgar Allan Poe-Serie vertonen.  So wird das leider nichts!  Schade!"
2,"Ich hab immer meine Zweifel wenn Künstler ankündigen: ""Alles wird Neu"". Und so war es diesmal auch. Die absolut geile Stimme von Oliver wird durch sinnlose Computerbeats tot gemacht. Gut bei ""Küsse und mehr""war das auch schon so, aber da gab es wenigstens noch eine Melodie dahinter. Hier kann man nur sagen : Oli goes Wendler. Spätestens bei dem nächsten Album ist er dort angelangt."
1,das album ist nicht wirklich keinen cent wert-da es melodisch wie auch stimmlich nichts zubieten hat-ich habe mir letztens das dance album von engelbert gekauft und muss sagen-das es einfach spitze ist.diese cd ist jedoch im vergleich zum dance album von engelbert nur mit einem glatten ungenügend zubewerten. ausserdem kommt er ohnenhin nicht an die topstars wie roland kaiser oder howard carpendale ran. das geld ist es nicht wert diese cd zukaufen-mit diesem album macht sich der wendler allermal zum prinz peinlich der nation zur werden. FAZIT: DÜNNE AUFGUSS STIMME ZU EINER GEPLATSCHTEN MISCHUNG AUS KEYBOARDS UND SYNTHESYSERN OHNE HÖHEPUNKTE
1,"Ich gebe dieser CD nur einen Stern , weil ihr nicht der Titel Kuschelrock zusteht. Die Stücke auf dieser CD sind zu wild , wenn ich dass sagen darf. Wie soll man da denn mit seinem Partner kuscheln? Ich finde man sollte die kUSCHELROCK CD's etwas ruhiger gestalten. Wer sein Geld zum Fenster rausschmeissen möchte , der braucht sie unbedingt , wer sich sein Geld sparen will kauft sich lieber eine bessere CD. Meine Kritik: ENTÄUSCHEND!"
1,"Das ist wohl die schlechteste Kuschelrock-Zusammenstellung aller Zeiten.Ein Stern ist eigentlich noch zuviel.Wenn den Machern von Kuschelrock nichts anderes mehr einfällt oder die Musikszene nichts besseres mehr hergibt, sollten sie vielleicht darüber nachdenken es mit dieser Jubiläumsausgabe bewenden zu lassen.Beim Hören dieser beiden Sampler rollen sich einem allenfalls die Fußnägel,kuschelige Stimmung kommt da sicher nicht auf!"
5,Super lehrreiches Hörspiel für Kids von 3-6 Jahren ! Ein Mix aus klass.Musik und erste Erdkundekenntnisse ! Schön gemacht.Die Kinder werden zum Mitmachen animiert.
5,"Man kauft eine CD, man hört sie sich dreimal an, fischt seine 3 Lieblingslieder raus und hört anschließend nur noch diese Lieder. Bekannt!? Ich hab' die CD jetzt seit 2 Jahren, konnte mich aber noch nicht für meine 3 Lieder entscheiden, da sind einfach 14 richtig gute Tracks drauf. Mir ist schon passiert, dass ich einen bestimmten Track hören wollte und mich verdrückt habe - zum Wegdrücken ist der Track aber trotzdem zu gut, das kann man nicht einfach wegdrücken. Ist mir bisher nur bei der CD passiert. Die CD ist seit 2 Jahren immer bei mir (kein Scherz), wenn ich ein paar Tage von zu Hause weg bin, nehme ich die mit."
2,"Über Herrn Westernhagens musikalische Verirrung während der 80er Jahre ist schon viel geschrieben worden; mit ""Lausige Zeiten"" war 1986 der absolute Tiefpunkt erreicht. Steril und kalt, künstliche Synthie-Klangteppiche statt ""echte"" Gitarren, wirre Texte - wer den rockigen, direkten Westernhagen Ende der 70er Jahre schätzt, dem muss dieses Album wie ein Faustschlag ins Gesicht vorkommen. Dennoch kann man dem Album - vielleicht nur aufgrund nostalgischer Fan-Gefühle - auch Gutes abgewinnen. ""Wir sitzen alle in einem Boot"", die damalige Single-Ausklopplung, ist sowohl musikalisch als auch textlich stark, und die Ballade ""Kein Gefühl"" geht unter die Haut und wird von Westernhagen noch heute live gespielt. Wegen dieser beiden Songs ertappe ich mich hin und wieder dabei, wie ich das Album als angenehme Abwechslung zu den von Westernhagen in den 90er Jahren mit viel Pathos eingespielten Stadionrock-Machtwerken auf den Plattenteller lege und einsehe: unterdurchschnittlich bis unhörbar, aber irgendwie kreativ. Es soll ja vorkommen, dass man sich im schwülen Hochsommer hin und wieder einen kalten Wintertag wünscht."
1,"Óh Mann, ganz schlecht!!! Er nimmt einfach seinen von Papi bekannten Namen und glaubt damit wäre im aller Erfolg schon sicher. Das Album bietet kaum irgendwas anspruchvolles oder wirklich überraschend gutes. Nur heiße Luft. Am aller schlimmsten ist seine Ausdrucksweise, kann dieser Junge überhaupt Englisch? Weis er was er da singt? Hat der überhaupt einen Schulabschluss?? Vielleicht sollte er bzw. die Macher dieser CD sich dass mal fragen und dann entscheiden ob es Sinn macht so was zu veröffentlichen. Fazit: Unterirdischer Kleinmädchen Pop und allerhand geklaute Samples!!! BAD TASTE!!!!"
2,"Nach fast 4 Jahren ist mir beim nochmaligen Hören und auch in Verbindung mit ihrer neuen CD ""Under rug swept"" endlich klar geworden, warum ich dieses CD einfach nicht so richtig mag und von Anfang an enttäuscht war: Es ist dieser Text-Overkill! Hören Sie mal richtig hin, Alanis muss nämlich immer so schnell singen und so endlos lange Strophen fabrizieren, weil sie es einfach nicht schafft, sich kurz zu fassen. Nun mag man dafür halten, dass sie halt viel zu sagen hat - geschenkt! Es geht auch kürzer, wie sie bei ihrem Erstling ""Jagged little pill"" trefflich bewiesen hatte. Bei ""Supposed ..."" will sie einfach alles und das ist zuviel und geht auch auf Kosten der Musik, die verzweifelt versucht mit diesen Text-Tiraden Schritt zu halten, was ihr eigentlich nur bei ""Joining you"" so richtig gelingt, das einzige Stück, wo Musik und Text harmonieren. Ansonsten meint es Miss Morissette einfach zu gut, sie will alles rauslassen, was sich in ihr angestaut hatte. Das ist an sich lobenswert und es tut mir auch in der Seele weh, etwas Kritisches über den Gutmensch aus Kanada zu sagen, aber sorry, Alanis, diese CD ging so ziemlich den Bach runter, weil du es zu gut machen wolltest. Rausgekommen ist eine Sammlung von ziemlich verkrampften Intellektualismen ohne musikalischen Charme. So bleiben am Ende nur 2 Sympathiesternchen"
1,"U2! Hat man den Bombast-Sound vielleicht ein wenig aus dem Auge verloren, ja ihn vielleicht sogar etwas vergessen. Vergessen, geht das? U2? Vergessen. NEIN. Die Rettung naht, die ganze REPUBLIK PLAKATIERT: U2 - 18 SINGLES. Zum tausendsten Mal ""With or Without You"" und Co. mit zwei neueren Singles.  Alles pünktlich zum Weihnachtsgeschäft. Was war denn mit den 2 Best-Ofs um die sich vor vier Jahren sämtliche Teenies gerissen haben - nichtsdestotroz U2 haben wohl den Pakt mit dem Teufel geschlossen, niemals länger als ein Jahr nicht auf Heavy Rotation im Radio und auf MTV gespielt zu werden! Die Songauswahl? Bescheiden bis Nett. Überflüssig. Die schon vor geraumer Zeit in den Pathos abgedrifteten Iren avancieren langsam zur uncoolsten Band der Rockgeschichte. Wie kann man das später nur mal seinen Kindern erklären, ""doch, doch die waren mal Rock'n'Roll..waren mal 'ne echte Band"""
2,"Über das Album selbst kann ich nichts Schlechtes sagen, da es nunmal einfach ziemlich genial ist.  Allerdings war ich von der DVD extrem enttäuscht. Ich hatte die Hoffnung, dass die DVD endlich das eigentliche Konzert zeigen würde. Fehlanzeige: Genauso wie bereits auf der VHS nerven mich die permanenten Einblendungen der Videoclips. Wenn ich die Clips sehen will, lege ich die Clips DVD ein :-( Scheinbar war man bei der Plattenfirma der Meinung, dass es langweilig sei, einen Keyboarder zu zeigen, der ja ""nur Knöpfchen drückt"". Aber genau das will ich eigentlich bei einem Livemitschnitt einer Elektroband sehen. Richtig nervig finde ich, dass selbst bei vielen genialen Gesangsparts (z.B. bei Vienna) Midge Ure nicht in Aktion gezeigt wird, sondern das millionenfach gesehene Videoclip dazu. Einfach nur ärgerlich..."
5,"Was für ein Vergnügen für einen alten Guns n Roses-Fan wie mich, nach so langer Zeit mal wieder etwas von der Band zu hören, die ich in meiner Jugend so verehrt habe. Zwar ist es schade, dass außer Axl Rose niemand mehr von der alten Stammbesetzung dabei ist, ich denke hier vor allem an den Gitarrengott Slash. Aber die neuen Songs klingen - nicht zuletzt aufgrund von Axl`s charakteristischen Vocals - nach wie vor unverkennbar nach den Gunners, wenn auch in modernem Gewand. Denn Axl hat sich lange Zeit gelassen und auch viel mit elektronischen Sounds experimentiert. Solche Effekte ist man von der Band natürlich nicht gewohnt, doch wird die Musik dadurch ungemein bereichert, wie ich finde.  Das Songmaterial kann ich nur als sehr gelungen bezeichnen. Die Stücke sind größtenteils eingängig und progressiv zugleich und entwickeln eine enorme Langzeitwirkung. Es handelt sich also eindeutig um einen sogenannten ""Grower"". Beim ersten Hören wird sich einem das Album in seiner ganzen Komplexität kaum erschließen. Dafür gefällt es mir bei jedem Durchgang immer besser und ich entdecke immer wieder neue Details. Die einzige Ausnahme bildet meines Erachtens der Titelsong ""Chinese Democracy"", der sehr einfach strukturiert ist und mir nicht so recht ins Ohr gehen will. Ansonsten sind alle Songs sehr gelungen. Meine absoluten Favoriten sind ""Shackler`s Revenge"", ""Better"", ""Catcher in the Rye"" und die tolle Ballade ""This I Love"". Diese Songs haben absolutes Hitpotential.  Unglaublich, was Axl hier für Spitzen-Musikern um sich geschart hat (Die Credit-Liste nimmt fast eine Komplette Booklet-Seite ein). Auch die Produktion ist perfekt.  Es gibt daher keinen Grund, sich dieses Album nicht zu gönnen, wenn man gerne moderne, anspruchsvolle Rockmusik hört... oder ein alter Guns n Roses-Fan ist, wie ich :-)"
4,"Die Aerosmithflügel sind auf recht eigenwillige Weise im neuen Jahrtausend angekommen. Denn vor dem Ausflug in Bluesgefilde hat man noch ein wenig experimentiert und versucht das klassische Songwriting der Band in ein komplett neues Soundgewand zu stecken. Loops, HipHop Grooves usw. alles inklusive. Die Scheibe wurde im Fanlager recht zwiespältig aufgenommen obwohl es im Grunde alles beinhaltet was man als Fan der späteren Luftschmiede zu schätzen wissen müsste.  Eben so zwiespältig teilt sich das Songmaterial auf. Und zwar in typische Balladen an denen die Band Geschmack gefunden hat und in schnellere, sexy Tanzrocker. In beiden Gefilden fühlen sie sich wohl und beherrschen sie aus dem Eff Eff aber die Gewichtung ist meines Erachtens nach etwas unglücklich ausgefallen.  Logisch, Jaded"", Fly Away From Here"" oder Avant Garden"" setzten die Serie vor die mit Angel"" begann, sich über Crazy""/""Cryin"" vorsetzte und irgendwann in I DonŽt Want To Miss A Thing"" mündete. Aber wenn die Scheibe mehr oder weniger von solchen Schmachtfetzen durchzogen ist dann wird's einem als Mann schon mal zu warm ums Herz.  So muss man sagen dass der fetzige Eindruck nach der eindrucksvollen Eröffnungsnummer Beyond Beautiful"" und dem wuchtigen Titeltrack schnell in überzuckerte Zärtlichkeitsorgien ausufert.  Wie gesagt, gut gemeint und gut gemacht aber manchmal darf es auch ein wenig mehr nach Joe Perry Gitarrenpower und weniger nach Steven Tylers ( oberamtlichen ) Organ klingen.  J.P.P."" ist besser als ihr Ruf und nicht schlechter als der Vorgänger Nine Lives"" aber bezüglich der schon vorher benannten Gewichtung kann sie nicht als zukünftiger Klassiker gehandelt werden.  Schade eigentlich, denn in Sachen Klangspektrum ist man definitiv im neuen Jahrtausend angekommen und in Sachen Songwriting hat man sich längst nicht von den eigenen Roots und der angestimmten Klasse entfernt.  Ich drück jetzt einfach noch mal play."
1,"Mike Oldfield hat mit seinen ersten Alben grandiose Musikflächen gemalt und auf einigen Alben immer wieder schöne Songs präsentiert. Aber was er uns hier zumutet, ist erschreckend! Fast durchweg wabbert Synthesizer-Gedudel und klacken drum-computer den Takt, und leider darf Simon Phillips nur ab und zu mal etwas dazuspielen. Das ganze Album würde etwas lebendiger klingen, wenn Mike diesen seinen ehemaligen Co-Produzenten das ganze Album hätte durchtrommeln lassen. Im längeren Instrumentalstück bedient er sich immer wieder an seinen eigenen Kompositionen. Da hört man Tubular-Bells-Fragmente durchblitzen, und auch das enervierende Geklöppel auf dem Vibraphon, das schon bei Incantations nervte, rüttelt wieder an den Nerven. Und mit Einsatz der Gesänge öffnet sich dann auch die Musikbox für Mutti, die gerade die Hemden bügelt. Zweit- bis drittklassige Synth-Pop-Liedchen traben gelangweilt dahin. Magic Touch wirkt noch am lebendigsten. Es scheint ein Outtake von frisch rockigen Discovery-Album zu sein, ist aber leider auch im synthigen Langweil-Pop produziert worden. Wenn dann im letzten Stück quälend hoffend der Satz durch die Lautsprecher schwebt: ""I was hoping could you be my inspiration"", verneint man heftig den Kopf schüttelnd diese letzte Hoffnung. Und auch hier hat sich MO wieder selber beklaut, weil der Refrain schon mal bei Islands in ähnlicher Form zu hören war. Wer hat Oldfield zu diesem Fehltritt getrieben? War es der übermächtige Virgin-Boss, der zu dieser Zeit Alben mit Hit-Singles und keine langen Epen von MO verlangte? Egal warum, man ist froh, wenn das Album endlich zu Ende ist und schwört sich, es nie wieder aufzulegen, es sei denn, Mutti möchte zum Bügeln Musik hören!"
5,"Und es gibt sie doch noch! Nach langem rechtlichen Hin und Her haben sich die verbliebenen Stratovarius- Mitglieder durchgesetzt und dürfen nun auch ohne Timo Tolkki unter diesem Namen weitermachen. Und dass sie sich ohne Ex-Mastermind Tolkki nicht verstecken müssen war ja abzusehen. Das Ergebnis liegt nun in Form von 'Polaris' vor. Nun dürfte nicht nur ich selbst wie ein Flitzebogen auf dieses Album gespannt gewesen sein sondern auch Unmengen von Fans, welche ich gleich an dieser Stelle beruhigen möchte denn einen großen Stilwechsel gab es auf keinen Fall. Ganz im Gegenteil. Das aktuelle Werk der Nordländer erinnert viel eher an die ""großen"" Werke wie 'Visions' oder 'Destiny' und ist auch, ich sag's gleich vorweg, um Längen besser als das letzte doch recht dürftige selbstbetitelte 'Stratovarious'-Album.  Los gehts mit 'Deep Unknown' welches gleich schön in die Vollen geht und im Refrain herrlich epische Chöre aufweist. Und auch der Rest der Scheibe ist echt hammermäßig ausgefallen! T. Kotipelto zeigt endlich mal wieder was in ihm steckt und auch der Rest der Band scheint ums Leben zu spielen. Neuzugang Matias Kupiainen an der Lead-Gitarre ist ein wahrer Künstler und steht Herrn Tolkki in nichts nach. Ausserdem dürfte wohl hauptsächlich ihm sowie dem nun doch nicht mehr ganz so neuen, wenn auch zum ersten Mal auf einem Studioalbum der Finnen zu hörenden Bassisten Lauri Porra die Frischzellenkur der Band anzulasten sein, denn endlich klingen Stratovarius wieder frisch und voller Power. Genau so wollen wir sie haben und nicht lahm, verfrickelt und mit depresivem Flair wie bei den letzteren Scheiben. Weiter geht es mit ""Falling Star"" und ""King Of Nothing"", die in die gleiche Bresche schlagen wie zuvor der Opener. Mit ""Blind"" hat man eine Speed-Kanone à la ""Speed Of Light"" losgelassen, bei welcher sich Drummer Jörg Michael endlich mal wieder so richtig austoben darf, bevor es mit ""Winter Skies"" wieder bedächtig wird. Nach dieser kurzen Erholungspause wird auch schon wieder direkt kräftig weitergerockt mit dem ebenfalls ziemlich schnellen ""Forever Is Today"". Mit ""Higher We Go"" hat man einen ausgesprochenen Earcatcher mit Hymnen-Charakter aufs Silberscheibchen gepackt und ""Somehow Precious"" zählt schon jetzt zu meinen Lieblings-Mitsing-Stücken. Vor dem zweiteiligen ""Emancipation Suite"" braucht auch keiner zurückzuschrecken, denn es handelt sich nicht um ein langatmiges Epos mit ellenlangen Soli sondern ein abwechslungsreiches gelungenes Stück mit klasse Breaks. Zum Abschluss dieses grandiosen Werks hat man mit ""When Mountains Fall"" noch eine richig schöne Ballade im Stil von ""Forever"" mit eingepackt. Sehr dramatisch!  Fazit: Stratovarius haben hier Altbewährtes wie starke Melodien, klasse Arrangements, erstklassige Musiker und ein wenig Epik in den großen Metal-Topf geworfen, mit jeder Menge frischer Power und zwei neuen Leuten an Bass und Gitarre gewürzt, kräftig umgerührt... - und heraus kam 'Polaris', das seit Jahren beste Album der Band! Unbedingt anhören, denn so sollen Stratovarius wirklich klingen!"
1,"Gespannt wie ein Flitzebogen war ich au das neue Album der Schweden und dann das: mal abgesehen von dem Opener Secrets, von dem ich gleich annahm, das das wegen des Intros auch der Opener bei den diesjährigen Festivals sein würde (was auch der Fall war), ist mir keiner der Songs bei mir hängen geblieben. Wobei sich das erste Stück dann nach dem Intro wie ein schlecht gemachtes Stück von Helloween aus alten Tagen anhört. Bei Knights of the 21st Century meint man, man wäre bei Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hide gelandet und bei  Imperial versucht sich jemand als Walter von der Vogelheide ohne Gesang. Wenn ich Minelieder hören will, kaufe ich kein Hammerfall-Album und somit hat der Titel auch nix auf ner Hammerfall-CD zu suchen. Trotz mehrfachen hörens: Das Album wird nicht besser, sondern jedesmal schlechter. Schade um das rausgeworenen Geld, für eine Band, der die Aftershowparty in Oberhausne dann auch noch wichtiger wr, als der Kontakt zu den Fans. Nee, Leute, eine Band, die vergessen hat, wer dafür sorgt, daß sie Geld verdienen, sollte besser wieder bei Mama in der Garage spielen und die Welt von solchen Alben verschonen.Damit dürfte klar sein: Finger weg von dieser schlecht gemachten Scheibe"
5,"Die Single Cry ist eine sehr schöne Ballade,die auch schon mal eine Gänsehaut auslösen kann.Wem sie nicht sooo gut gefällt kann sich auf die tollem Extras freuen!!Denn diesmal wurden auf Re-mixes verzichtet und Shout und Streetwalker erfreuen den Hörer! Auf jeden Fall eine Empfehlung von mir!!"
1,"Für mich ist dies die schlechteste der bisher 127 Folgen der drei ???. Ich kann nicht zustimmen, dass dies ein technisch gutes Hörspiel ist. Die Lautstärke ist so schlecht ausgesteuert, dass man entweder den leisen Teil gar nicht mehr versteht oder beim lauteren Teil einen Hörsturz bekommt.  Die deutsche Freundin der drei ???, die wir schon aus der vorhergehenden Folge kennen, lacht ständig laut gackernd an unpassenden Stellen. Die Geschichte ist merkwürdig zusammengestückelt und langweilig. Ich halte allgemein nicht viel von den Buchvorlagen von Brigitte Johanna Henkel-Waidhofer, aber dies ist für mich der Tiefpunkt. Ergo: Fans der drei ??? kaufen sie sich trotzdem, wer nur ein nettes Hörspiel für sein Kind sucht greift lieber zu einer anderen Folge der drei ???."
5,1996 konnten purple fans aufatmen. das ewige gezaenke um + mit ritchie blackmore war zu ende. und das tat den herren hoerbar gut.
2,"Nach der einigermaßen rockigen ""Burn"" war dieser Nachfolger eine Enttäuschung.  Der Reihe nach: 1. Stormbringer: geht sofort gut zur Sache, geiler Basslauf. 2. Love Don't Do It Right: das ist Pop, auch der Text lässt zu wünschen übrig (""I need my money, uuuh yeah!"") 3. Holy Man: nicht schlecht, klingt nach Tommy Bolin. 4. Hold On: Supermarkt-Musik, groovt zurückhaltend, das Gitarensolo könnte von Status Quo sein. 5. Lady Double Dealer: nach Stormbringer der zweite Rocker. 6. You Can't Do It Right: Funky-Pop. Mother's Finest hat daraus später einen eigenen Stil entwickelt. 7. High Ball Shooter: treibender Bass, hat das Zeug für einen typischen Whitesnake-Song. 8. The Gypsy: unspektakulär, wird dann auch gelangweilt ausgeblendet. 9. Soldier Of Fortune: DP und Balladen? Da gehen die Geschmäcker auseinander.  Klingt am Anfang ganz kurz nach LZs ""Stairway to heaven"", dann die Akustikgitarre wie Rod Stewart's ""Sailing"". Schön!"
2,"Vorweg sei gesagt, daß diese Rezension natürlich nur meine eigene subjektive Meinung widerspiegeln kann.  Für mein persönliches Empfinden ist diese CD eine Zusammenstellung aus abgedroschenen Phrasen, die lediglich das alte Klischee der Enspannungsübungen widergeben. Spätestens, als ich im Wald spazieren gehen sollte war ich auf 100. Auch die Musik ist das übliche alte Einheitsgedudel. Fazit: Ich habe mich geärgert, daß ich mir dies vor dem ""Schlafen wollen"" überhaupt angetan habe.Für mich nicht geeignet."
5,Wer die Cranberries mochte wird dieses Album lieben. Die Stimme ist einfach einzigartig.
1,"Die einzelnen Stücke sind alle nach dem gleichen Muster gestrickt: Schmalz ohne Ende, ein Eindruck, den die Zitterharmonika ganz kräftig unterstützt. Das Werk wurde offenbar exakt passend zum Weihnachtsgeschäft gestaltet, zumal auch die Vorgeschichte des Vortragenden dafür ideal ist. Außergewöhnliche Mundharmonika-Fähigkeiten jenseits von Schmalz konnte ich nicht heraushören. Wirklich erstaunlich, wie schnell man eine solche CD auf den Markt bringen kann."
1,"Ich war hin und weg von dieser Scheibe! Also will meinen, ich habe hingehört und bin weg gelaufen! Schwülstig, übertrieben, ohne Gefühl. Die sicherlich ausgebildeten Stimmen schaffen es spielend die Originale kaputt zu singen. Gegen die Opernverwurstung ist Peter Hofmann ein Superstar! Ich habe jetzt schon Gänsehaut, wenn ich dran denke, dass ich meiner Ma die CD gekauft habe und sie bei passender Gelegenheit auch mal bei ihr zum Kaffeekranz ""geniessen"" darf. Im Gegenzug erhält sie von meiner Freundin ""Pavarotti and Friends"". Das sind nachgespielte Lieder, die ich mir gerne anhöre. Könner, die es schaffen, das Original am Leben zu lassen, teilweise einen interessanten Blickwinkel auf das Original zu verschaffen. Der von mir vergebene Punkt ist - da man um die Bewertung ja nicht herum kommt - mit einem dicken Minus davor zu sehen!!!"
2,"Gerade hat man es geschafft Weezer ""Maladroit"" zu verzeihen, die Scheibe, die nach kürzester Zeit und mit aller Macht dem grünen Album hinterhergeschoben wurde. ""Maladroit"" war aber anscheinend nicht nur eine augenblickliche Bestandsaufnahme, sondern ein Offenbarungseid. Der Nachfolger ""Make believe"" macht es leider deutlich: Der Höhepunkt der Schaffenszeit von Weezer ist scheinbar überschritten."
5,"Diese CD habe ich zu erstenmal mit 14 Jahren gehört und sie hat mich seitdem begleitet. Immer wieder kommt man auf diese mit Liebe und Witz gemachten Kleinodien zurück um sich in ihnen zu verlieren. Sei es nun die behäbige Melancholie von ""The world has turnend"", die Surfpunk-Hymne ""Surf Wax America"" oder der spannungsgeladene, totale Euphorie verursachende Mittelteil von ""Only in Dreams"". Weezer haben sich mit dieser CD, wenigstens für mich, unsterblich gemacht."
5,"Die gute Nachricht für alle, die mit leichtem Bangen so lange darauf gewartet haben: Alles was man an Maximo Park liebt ist noch da! Und zusätzlich ist das Zweitwerk auch noch wirklich gut, welches man ja nicht von allen NewBritPop-Bands behaupten oder erwarten kann.  Habe ich lange Maximo Parks erste Scheibe immer wieder in meinen CD-Player gelegt und konnte behaupten, daß dies die beste Platte der letzten Jahre ist  (zusammen mit Bloc Partys ""Silent Alarm""), bekomme ich jetzt mit ""Our Earthly Pleasures"" würdigen Bonus! Auch diese Platte ist ein Grower, den man immer wieder hören wollen wird! Klaro, wurde ein wenig geändert (stellenweise hat die Gitarre mehr Druck oder Orgel und Klavier kommen mehr in den Vorgrund) oder Dinge sind jetzt noch ein wenig besser und dicker(z.B. Pauls Gesang/ Stimme ist weicher und gleichzeitig ausdrucksvoller geworden), aber im großen und ganzen machts noch mehr Spaß mit alten Bekannten, die jetzt die Erfahrung und Übung einer (Fast-)Welttournee mit sich tragen.  Trotz einiger Verschönerung immer noch ruppig und breakig genug to file under Indie-Pop not Kommerz.  Ebenfalls klar, diese neue CD kann nicht eine Ansammlung von Hits sein, aber grundsätzlich höre ich keine großen Ausfälle oder Songs, die total daneben sind und das Schöne ist ja, daß bei Maximo Park immer noch die Option besteht, daß die Songs bei längerem Hören noch besser werden können.(meistens werden sperrige erste Minuten dann sowieso von großartigen Gesangsmelodien aufgelöst)  Folgende Songs gefallen mir bis jetzt am besten:  ""Books from Boxes"" (locker, fluffig mal eben DER Song für den warmen Frühlingstag mit offenen Verdeck oder Kopf aus dem Autofenster durch die Rapsfelder und Wiesen düsen)  ""Russian Literature"" (Knackige, sich steigernde 3Min, die mich komischerweise zuerst an Schulmusical und gleichzeitig an angefangene Hymne aus einem Rocky-Film denken lassen. Vergesst das lieber...Lied ist super und beim Konzert werden lauthals Finger in die Luft schnellen)   ""The Unshockable""(das meinte ich mit eher am Anfang sperrig und zum Ende Melodie zum Mitmachen, hat zusätzlich mehr was von Anfang 80ger Wave-Punk)  ""By the Monument""(Jawohl, das ist ein Hit zum Tanzen, Mitsingen und zum einfach nur freuen, erinnert vom bleibenden Geschmack her ein wenig an ""The Coast is always changing"")  ""Nosebleed""(nach dem ersten Hören hatte ich schon einen Ohrwurm, schöne Gesangsmelodien in einem Lied verschwenderisch verbraten, haben ja genug davon)  ""A Fortnights Time""(da stell ich mir vor, daß die frühen ABBA sich so im Proberaum angehört haben, als sie noch nur BB und wild waren)  ""Sandblasted""(schöne, zum Ende hin Uptempo-Ballade) Das sind, natürlich zusammen mit dem annehmbaren ""Apply Some Pressure""-Nachfolger ""Our Velocity"", meine momentanen Lieblinge, aber wer weiß, vielleicht zünden die anderen auch noch.  Kurzum nochmal gesagt: Maximo Park haben zu unserem Glück alles richtig gemacht, kauft die Platte und habt das ganze Jahr oder länger viel Spaß und irgendwann einmal schöne Erinnerungen an den Frühling/ Sommer 2007! Kurzer Nachtrag: Die Band sagte im Interview, die neue Platte sei eine Mischung aus den frühen Smashing Pumpkins und The Cure. Hmm, vielleicht kann ich den Ansatz im allerkleinesten Nenner verstehen, dann kann man aber auch irrelevanterweise Placebo und die Dire Straits plus Spandau Ballet hinzufügen ;) ...hat aber nur wenig mit diesem neuen Album zu tun! Lasst euch nicht verwirren!"
2,"Habe mir die CD aufgrund der vielen positiven Bewertungen zugelegt und bin maßlos enttäuscht. Ging J. Fogerty auf seiner letzten CD - Blue Moon Swamp- ganz neue Wege, so kehrte er hier wieder auf den ausgetrampelten CCR Pfad zurück. Ich mag CCR und mir gefiel auch sein Konzert im letzten Jahr, jedoch fand ich es auch hier schon merkwürdig, daß Fogerty nicht den Mut hatte, das wirklich hervorragende Material von Blue Moon Swamp mit einzubauen. Aber gut, live sind halt die alten Gassenhauer gefragt. Fazit: Die immer gleichen Riffs, kein Risiko, keine gute CD."
2,"Vier Jahre lagen zwischen dem letzten (eher brachialen) Young-Studioalbum ""Broken Arrow"" (1996) und ""Silver &amp; Gold"" (2000). Vier Jahre sind in der Young'sche Zeitrechnung verdammt lang. Wahrscheinlich hat er diese Phase zur Entspannung und Rückbesinnung genutzt, und so verwundert es nicht, dass ""Silver &amp; Gold"" ausschließlich mit Folk und Country im 70er-Jahre-Retro-Stil darher kommt. Rein akustisch instrumentiert, ruhig, friedlich, offensichtlich völlig mit sich selbst im Reinen - eigentlich keine schlechten Voraussetzungen für ein Young-Album, hat der Meister doch mit ""After the Goldrush"", ""Harvest, ""Comes a time"" oder ""Harvest Moon"" passable bis überragende Werke dieses Stilrichtung abgelegt. Aber ""Silver &amp; Gold"" ist leider nur Album voller durchschnittlicher Kost ohne jegliche Höhepunkte. Eintönig plätschert es vor sich hin, lässt hier und da kleine Erinnerungen an die eigenen Meisterwerke durchsickern, kann sich aber zu keinem Zeitpunkt mit diesen messen. ""Good to See You"", ""Without Rings"" oder ""Buffalo Springfield Again"" sind nette kleine Songs, das war's dann aber auch schon - für Young'sche Maßstäbe eindeutig zu wenig."
5,"""Through These Eyes"" ist eine meiner jüngsten ""Entdeckungen"", und ich frage mich, wieso ich von dieser enorm guten Veröffentlichung fast 10 Jahre lang keine Kenntnis genommen habe. Bliss (diejenigen, deren Scheiben unter dem Label ""Blissful Music"" erscheinen - es gibt/gab noch mindestens drei weitere Formationen unter diesem Namen) sind hierzulande weitgehend unbekannt. In erste Linie deshalb, weil sie nicht gezielt vermarktet werden und sich weitgehend auf Weiterempfehlungen verlassen... Der gelegentlich anzutreffende Vergleich mit Enya ist zumindest nicht völlig unpassend: Die Stimmungen sind ähnlich, und auch der Einsatz von Elektronik und Instrumentierung gehen in eine ähnliche Richtung. Dabei ist die Musik von Bliss klarer, weniger verspielt und bombastisch, weniger kommerziell und radiotauglich. Sängerin Lucinda Drayton ist eine Klasse für sich. Es ist durchweg eine Freude, ihr zuzuhören. Ihre wunderbar klare und sanfte, aber dennoch akzentuierte Stimme setzt sie technisch gekonnt ein. Bliss' Musik ist durchgehend melodisch, zuweilen ein wenig sentimental, bleibt aber stets souverän und verströmt verinnerlichte Entspanntheit. Einige Stücke, vor allem die rein instumentalen, haben einen eher meditativen Charakter. Das ist kein Zufall, sondern spiegelt die Lebenseinstellung der Künstler wider. Das unprätentiöse Cover der CD gibt bereits einen Hinweis auf eine für Profimusiker wenig kommerzielle Ausrichtung. Glücklicherweise sind Bliss' CDs dennoch über Amazon erhältlich (Tip: auch mal bei Amazon.co.uk nachschauen)."
1,"Ich war enttäuscht von dieser CD-Box. Dies sind keine originalen Aufnahmen, sondern Neuaufnahmen, die das besondere Gefühl, das ich früher immer hatte, wenn ich Howies Musik hörte, vermissen lassen. Daher auch nur ein Stern."
5,"Ich will und kann Nick Drake mit niemand vergleichen, die Gefühle die mit seiner Musik hervorbringt sind einzigartig! Wer dieses Album zum ersten mal hört, darf sich auf eine der allerschönsten, und zugleich auch traurigsten Platten freuen.         Danke Nick für deine Musik! Nur schade, dass es hier für dich keinen Platz gegeben hat."
1,"Schade, dass man nicht 0 Sterne vergeben kann!!! Man fühlt sich an ""Fetenhits"" oder ""Ballermann-Hits"" erinnert, wo irgendwelche Musik mit irgendeinem Rhythmus unterlegt wird. Wie oft passt es einfach nicht. Rappen im Walzertakt kann nicht schlimmer sein. Wer kubanische Musik mag, sollte sich lieber eine CD von I. Ferrer ( ), C. Segundo ( ) etc. holen. Wer Udo Lindenberg, 2Raumwohnung oder einen der anderen deutschen Künstler mag, sollte sich auch hier beim Original bedienen, da die meisten von ihnen dieses Trittbrettfahren absolut nicht nötig haben."
1,"Als alter Bowie-Fan, der nun wirklich so ziemlich jede Platte hat, frage ich mich nun seit einigen Jahren, was diese Abzocke eigentlich soll??? Jedes Jahr eine neue Edition, mit anderen angeblichen Neuheiten - aber weitgefehlt - nichts Neues kennt man nicht! Vor allem ärgerlich, immer wieder die dummen und gewöhnlichen Single-Versionen, dann das ganze auch noch auf DVD - wirklich kapitalistischer Unsinn. Wie wäre es denn tatsächlich mal mit einer 'Raritätensammlung' wie z.B. die ganzen Maxisingle-Versionen aus den 80igern, mit den Tracks, die auf den B-Sides erschienen waren wie 'Julie' oder 'Girls' oder 'Don't Look Down' (Reggae-Version) oder 'Dancing with the big boys (Extended Dance Mix)' oder 'Magic Dance' (in Amerika erschienen)!?????!!!!! Und wie sieht es mit 'Ragazza Sola Ragazza Solo' die italienische Version von 'Space Oddity' - oder 'Love you til Tuesday - Liebe dich bis Dienstag' die deutsche Version???? Oder verschiedene Studio-Takes???!!!??? Also es gäbe durchaus interessantes Material vom Meister. Aber solange die Plattenfirmen und der Chef persönlich (Bowie) nur an Abzocke denkt, werden wir weiterhin mit diesem Müll zugeballert. Also kann es nur heißen: Kaufverweigerung!!!"
5,"Die lange Zeit des wartens und des hoffens ist vorüber. Iced Earth haben dank der Rückkehr von Matt Barlow zu Ihrer alten Stärke zurück gefunden.  Die ersten Lieder machen auf jeden Fall Lust auf mehr.  Zu bewundern gibt es Iced Earth auf dem Rock Hard Festival in Gelsenkirchen und beim Bang your Head in Balingen.  Jetzt bleibt nur noch zu hoffen, dass das neue Album pünktlich im Herbst erscheint um den Titel ""Album des Jahres"" abzuholen.  KAUFEN!!!!!!!"
2,iced earth hatte ein paar geniale alben zu beginn und mit ripper owen wohl den höhepunkt erreicht. das sie diesen durch ihren alten sänger ersetzt haben ist traurig denn damit kehren zurück zur mittelmässigkeit - leider.
1,"Ich bin in den (zweifelhaften) Genuß gekommen, das Album schon etwas vor seinem Erscheinungstermin hören zu können. Was soll ich sagen ? Ich bin eigentlich ein großer Iced Earth-Fan, zumindest mal bis einschließlich Horror Show. Danach ging's ja stetig bergab. War Framing Armageddon schon schlecht, ist The Crucible Of Man noch schlechter, auch wenn Jon Schaffer sich mittlerweile ja selbst ganz gerne groß redet und er Matt Barlow wieder in die Band geholt hat (man munkelt, mager besuchte Konzerte und Verkaufszahlen von Framing Armageddon könnten wohl auch damit zu tun haben) ... Hier jedoch ist sein Songwriting am absoluten Nullpunkt angekommen.  Nach einem seelenlosen Baukastensystem reiht sich identisches Riff an Riff, belanglose Gesangsmelodien am laufenden Meter, im Zweifelsfall wird mal ein Chor drumherum gebaut. Interessante Breaks, Rhythmen oder Melodien sucht man mit der Lupe. Zwar ist die Rückkehr von Matt Barlow positiv hervorzuheben, aber auch dieser kann das katastrophale Songmaterial nicht retten. Nein, Jon Schaffer scheint jegliche Kreativität der frühen Tage verloren zu haben, will sich dies aber offentsichtlich nicht eingestehen oder hat es selbst noch nicht begriffen. Seine vielgepriesene Something Wicked-Story, die den Höhepunkt seiner Karriere hätte darstellen sollen, ist zum absoluten Tiefpunkt dieser einst so brillianten Band geworden. Wahrscheinlich gibt es aber genug Magazine, die mal wieder mit Vorschußlorbeeren um sich werfen ... Normalerweise würde ich für 60 Minuten Langeweile zwei Punkte verteilen, da es aber ganz sicher genug Leute gibt, die völlig überzogene 5 Punkte geben, und da es die dritte Gurkenscheibe in Folge ist, gibt's einen mageren Punkt. RIP, Iced Earth ..."
5,"Ich bin kein großer Freund von Finntroll, Falkenbach, Amon Amarth, Amorphis und Konsorten. Irgendwie bekomme ich da immer Kopfschmerzen von.  &lt;--&gt; Warum alles bei Eluveitie anders ist? &lt;--&gt; Weil sie eben nicht Pagan-Metal machen, sondern melodic death metal mit Pagan-Instrumenten. Eluveitie klingen wie Dark Tranquillity ohne Computersounds, statt dessen tönen Flöten, Dudelsack und Drehleier. Vor allem Sänger Chrigel Glanzmann (der heißt wirklich so :D) erinnert sehr an Dark Tranquillity's Mikael Stanne. Neben (oder mit...) dem Pagan-Anteil gehts aber ziemlich heftig zur Sache; die beschauliche Lagerfeuer-Atmosphäre vieler anderer Pagan-Bands lassen Eluveitie nur in den 3 akustischen Liedern aufkommen. Die anderen Lieder - auch wenn man sie am Lagerfeuer spielen würde - sorgen mit Riffs aus dem Metal-Bilderbuch und fliegenden Flöten- und Gitarrenmelodien für kreisende Haare und heisere Kehlen, ohne zu fast-food-Humppa-Party-metal zu werden (siehe Finntroll, Equilibirum). Außerdem klingen Eluveitie (übrigens 8 MusikerInnen) sehr modern, weil einige der Riffs durchaus metal-core'ige Anteile haben. Einziger Wehrmutstropfen: Die drei gänzlich instrumentalen Kelten-Klänge-Lieder finde ich sehr uninspiriert ... fast so, als hätte da jemand willkürlich schöne Töne mit keltischen Instrumenten erzeugt, ohne sie sinnvoll zu einem Lied zu verbinden. Doch werden die wenigen akustischen Minuten von Melodie und Metal einfach weggewalzt; und  --&gt; übrig bleibt der für mich überzeugenste und ausgereifteste melodic-Folk-Pagan-death-metal-irgendwas-Release, den ich je gehört hab  (Equilibirum und Finntroll sind mir zu 'spaßig', Falkenbach zu pathetisch und Amon Amarth ist sowieso death metal ...)"
2,"Die Reihe ""Hitgiganten"" ist die zehntausendste Aufbereitung von Oldies, die beihnahe eh jeder bereits im Plattenschrank hat. Mal gelingt die Zusammenstellung, mal nicht."
1,"Also Leute mal Hand auf's Herz. Wie die vorige Kritik aussagt: ""Mal wieder eine musikalische Glanzleistung"" - oder ""In Extremo Fans sind erstmal geschockt"" - ja in der Tat. Also ich bin In Extremo Fan. Habe fast alle Platten und auch die Live DVDs, habe sie schon Live gesehen und bin von all diesen Scheiben und Auftritten restlos begeistert. Die Gruppe ist einfach einmalig und würde die Jungs gerne mal wieder auf einen Mittelalterlichen Markt wieder sehen. Aber zur ""Hameln"" war ich echt erstmal total geschockt. Was höre ich da für eine CD  - boah - was ist das ? Okay die erste Scheibe, aber soon Schrott ! Na das muß nicht sein. Ich war froh als die CD endlich zu Ende war. Kaum Gesang die Instrumental-Stücke sind eintönig ohne jegliche Ideen. Also wenn einer In Extremo gerne hört (neue Lieder), der darf diese Platte auf keinen Fall kaufen - die Enttäuschung wäre einfach zur groß. Nun ja, aber trotzdem es war die erste Scheibe von den Jungs. Alle anderen (die Goldene habe ich noch nicht gehört) Tonträger sind allererste Sahne und Oberklasse. Danke das es Euch gibt !"
5,"Mir gefallen ihre rockigen Songs auch besser und ich gebe zu, dass ich beim ERSTEN Hören leicht enttäuscht war, doch schon beim zweiten Mal wurde mir klar, dass es sich bei ""Hot Space"" um ein weiteres Meisterwerk der vier Briten handelt, mit welchem sie einmal mehr ihr Allroundertum im Musikgeschäft unter Beweis stellten. Die weniger Toleranten unter den eingefleischten Rockfans dürften Mühe mit ""Hot Space"" haben, selbst wenn es nicht einmal so ist, dass überhaupt keine Gitarrenriffs oder -solos vorkommen. Sie seien vor ""Hot Space"" gewarnt, damit diese und andere Rezensionslisten sowie noch unvoreingenommene Musikliebhaber vor vernichtenden, unqualifizierten Pauschalurteilen selbsternannter Queenfans verschont bleiben. ""Hot Space"" ist ein vielschichtiges, typisch abwechslungsreiches Album mit genialen Originalmelodien, geschickt platzierten Klängen, z.T. äusserst tiefsinnigen Texten (""...keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn..."", um nur ein Beispiel zu nennen) und natürlich der unverändert brillianten Stimme Freddies - einfach ""godlike"", wie alles was die Band berührte. Verglichen mit dem, was heute die Charts beherrscht, hätte jeder einzelne Song auf ""Hot Space"" absolut zwingend als Single ausgekoppelt werden müssen. Queen forever!"
5,"Kurz vor den Aufnahmen zu LIGHTS OUT hatten UFO ihren eher nervigen Keyboarder Denny Peyronel durch den ex-Savoy Brown Tastenmann und Rythmusgitarristen Paul Raymond ersetzt (der übrigens heute immer noch bzw. wieder zum UFO Line Up gehört). Ein weiser Entschluss! Denn Raymond ist ein hervorragender Musiker erstens genau wusste wie sich ein Keyboard bei einer Hardrock Band anzuhören hat und zweitens auch sehr gut Gitarre spielen konnte und somit Michael Schenkers grandiosen Leadspiel den Rücken frei halten konnte (vor allem Live) und somit den Sound UFO`s erst so richtig perfektionierte. Auch die Hinzunahme des Produzenten Ron Nevison erwies sich als Volltreffer, er hauchte dem Sound der Band dieses unverwechselbare epische Feeling ein. LIGHTS OUT deckt alle Spektren des Siebzigerjahre Hardrocks ab. Mitreissende Heavyreisser wie ""Too Hot To Handle"" und der Titeltrack ""Lights Out"", sphärischer Melodicrock bei ""Electric Phase"" und dem absoluten Hammersong ""Love To Love"" dessen Intro ein perfekter Soundtrack für jeden Science Fiction Film wäre. Mit der intensiv dargebrachten Ballade ""Try Me"", dem verspielten ""Just Another Suicide"" und der sehr gelungenen Coverversion des LOVE - Klassikers ""Alone Again Or"" blicken UFO über den üblichen hardrock - Tellerrand hinaus und runden das Album perfekt ab. Der Sound ist fantastisch und klingt auch nach nunmehr fast 30 Jahren frisch und Zeitlos. Produzent Ron Nevison sorgte für eine in sich geschlossene, spannende Atmosphäre und Schenkers Solis sind bei jedem Song ein Erlebniss, besonders das Schlusssolo bei ""Lights Out"", hier jagt es einem einen Schauer nach dem Anderen über den Rücken. Gänshaut pur!!!!!!"
5,"Heimlich sind die 17 HIPPIES auf dem Weg etwas ganz besonderes, ja etwas ganz eigenes zu werden. Fast unbemerkt von der hiesigen Presse, gehen sie auf diesem zweiten Studioalbum den Weg konsequent weiter, der sich auf ihrem ersten Longplayer ""Ifni"" angekündigt hat. Von Mariachi und Chanson, über Balkan und Singer-Songwriter Pop, bis Raga und Cajun; scheinbar mühelos verweben sie Einflüsse aus aller Welt zu ihrer unverwechselbaren Musik. Ihrem ""Berlin Style"". Ganz angekommen sind sie noch nicht, und doch sind sie schon jetzt weit über allem anderen hinaus, was sich da sonst noch in diesen Gefilden tummelt. Mit ihrer nächsten CD, so meine Prognose, ist es aus mit Heimlich!"
5,"Marvin Gaye ist der erfolgreichste Künstler des Labels ""Motown"". Das Best Of Album ist meiner Meinung nach sehr gut gelungen. Auf 2 CDs findet man alle Hits für die Marvin Gaye bekannt ist, auch die erfolgreichsten Titel die zusammen mit Temmi Terrell eingesungen wurden.(z.B ""Your Precious Love"" und das großartige ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"") Und auch wenn einige Titel bereits über 40 Jahre alt sind, so klingen sie trotzdem immer noch zeitgemäß.  Ohne Marvin Gaye und seine tollen Soul und Motown Klassiker wär heutiger R&amp;B, Neo-Soul etc. nicht denkbar. Anspieltipps: ""I Heard It Through The Grapevine""; ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"", ""Stubborn Kind Of Fellow"", und ""How Sweet It Is"", aber eigentlich alle!!!"
5,"This album probably is my favourite one...Ive bought it at the last of the 5 albums but I think its the very best one... The songs sound like 70s music, great changes of the music stiles. There are some title to rock on, some title are pretty slowly and a bit sad. The best song on this album is ""Lady""- as also t-mobile found out and took this song for their commercial use.  Eyeryone who likes music from the seventies but also a very very good rock music from today should by this great album! Its the best one Ive got!!!"
5,"da ich bereits seit ihrem ersten album ein fan von mando diao bin, kann ich sagen, dass auch ihr neues albun ""give me fire"" keineswegs seinen vorgängern in irgendeiner art und weise nachsteht! diesmal sind wieder einige schnelle nummern vertreten, die meiner meinung nach am besten zu mando diao passen. vor allem ""come on come on"" und ""give me fire"" verleihen dem album den richtigen schwung. allerdings gehört auch die etwas langsamere nummer ""high heels"" mittlerweile zu meinen absoluten lieblingssongs obwohl ich sagen muss, dass einige lieder erst nach mehrmaligem hören richtig ins ohr gehen.  auf jeden fall ist dieses album ein muss für jeden fan und auch für alle, die vielleicht erst durch ihren charterfolg ""dance with somebody"" auf diese einzigartigen schweden gekommen sind!"
5,"""God Knows i want it bad tonight""  You might have listened to this a hundreds of times and you must be a fool if you ever get enough of it.  One of the great songs by Mando Diao. Essential for your collection!"
5,"Bei dem Preis unverzichtbar! Für die Operneinspielungen, das Requiem und komplexere Meisterwerke wird man noch eine zweite Einspielung brauchen. Was offensichtlich (mit Absicht) fehlt, ist der Zusatz KV 623a zur Freimaurerkantate """"Laßt uns mit geschlung'nen Händen"" (Männerchor mit Orgel), aus dessen Melodie später die heutige Österreichische Nationalhymne wurde. Das hätte man bringen sollen, zumal das nur 3 Minuten dauert, auch wenn die Herkunft nicht unumstritten ist und das Werk auch von Johann Hölzel sein könnte. Mozart ist so groß, daß so viele unbekannte Schönheiten unverdient unbekannt bleiben. Diese Edition ändert das! Eine Fundgrube! Kleingeistige Kritik an einzelnen Aufnahmen verbietet sich hier von selbst."
1,"Die guten Songs kann man an einer Hand abzählen, das Miximg ist hoprig und das Cover sieht aus wie aus einem Billig-Porno.  Kann man sich sparen!"
5,"Hab gerade die neue Big City Beats erhalten und muss sagen, mit dem beginnenden guten Wetter hab ich genau die richtige Scheibe für meinen Sommer. Die Beats sind auf diesem Album fantastisch frisch und incl. dem Cover eine weitere Ohren und Augenweide in meinem CD-Regal. Thumbs up"
1,"Ich bin Boney M. Fan. Schon seit bestehen der Gruppe. War aber von diesem Album sehr enttäuscht. Schon alleine das Design. Was war mit der Originalschrift. Den Fans eine so langweilige Schrift zu präsentieren, das war man von Frank Farian nicht gewöhnt. Man merkt, da kam an Ideenreichtum nix mehr rüber. Sieht total billig aus. Für eine Poppgruppe der obersten Kategorie unwürdig. Die Songs waren für mich ein Rückschritt, gegenüber 10.000 Lightyears und Boonoonoonoos. Diese beiden Alben entwickelten sich soundmäßig weiter. Auch gab es für diese Alben TV-Speciells. Lieblos wurde Eye Dance auf den Markt geschmissen. Hauptsache verkaufen. Kein Poster dabei, oder wenigstens Songtexte. Man merkte, für Farian war Boney M. abgeschrieben. Dann hätte man sich dieses Album auch sparen können. Mit 10 Songs war es eh sehr dürftig. Normale Alben hatten 12 Lieder.10 Songs war man bei Boney M. seit Take the heat of me nicht mehr gewöhnt. Tolle Leistung! Ich bin da ehrlich als Boney M. Fan. Das war das schlechteste Album meiner Lieblingsgruppe.  Schwöre eh auf Boonoonoonoos! Aber das ist Geschmackssache. ;&lt;)"
5,"Diese Greatest Hits Collection ist einfach toll. Auch wenn die grosse Zeit der Gombay Dance Band vor langer Zeit war, so verdienen sie es, auch heute noch Gehör zu finden. Es sind tolle Titel dabei und es ist schön, dass Sun of Jamaica ein Evergreen ist und Eldorado unvergessen und Aloha he einen an Urlaub denken lässt. Ihre Lieder sind vereint in dieser Box und es ist schön sich fallen zu lassen und all die schönen Lieder zu hören, dabei in Erinnerungen zu schwelgen und sich zu freuen. Mal abgesehen von dem guten Klangerlebnis, welches einen die uralten Schallplatten vergessen lässt, auf denen so manches knistern und kratzen zu hören war.  Ein rundum tolles Paket!"
5,"Wer gerne zum Fasching bzw. Karneval geht, kennt diese Songs! Super klasse! Auf jeder Party ist diese Cd der ""Kracher""! Alle können gleich mitsingen und mitswingen! Bei diesen Klängen bleibt keiner der Gäste sitzen! Diese Musik erinnert an Urlaub im Süden! Sie weckt die Lebensgeister! Sogar die ""Hausarbeit"" geht mit dieser ""Mucke"" im Ohr, leichter von der Hand! Einfach nur zu empfehlen diese Scheibe!"
5,"Vor ein paar Jahren wäre man für verrückt erklärt worden, wenn man vorhergesagt hätte, Agnetha Fältskog von ABBA würde nach der Jahrtausendwende nochmal ein Comeback starten. Aber nun liegt es vor, und die Idee, ein Album mit Coverversionen von teilweise fast vergessenen Klassikern vor allem aus den 60er Jahren zu machen, ist genial. Agnetha hat die Songs selbst ausgewählt, und man hört die Freude, die sie an diesen Liedern hat, heraus. Besonders gelungen ist ""Sealed With A Kiss"", das auch heute noch ein Ohrwurm ist. Die erste Single ""If I Thought You'd Ever Change Your Mind"" geht einem auch nicht mehr aus dem Kopf und dürfte ein Hit werden, auch wenn die Aufnahme nicht ganz zeitgemäß klingt (das soll sie wohl auch nicht, und übrigens werden auf Maxi-CD auch noch moderne Remixe von Almighty veröffentlicht). Sehr gefühlvoll auch ""Love Me With All Your Heart"", und am Schluß gibt es noch Party-Sound mit ""When You Walk In The Room"". Nicht ganz so gelungen ist beispielsweise der Titelsong ""My Colouring Book"", was nicht an Agnethas Stimme liegt, sondern am Schmalzgehalt des Liedes. Insgesamt wird die CD zwar vor allem die Fans von Agnetha erfreuen, aber sie bietet auch für andere die Gelegenheit, große Hits aus der Vergangenheit mit der besonderen Stimme von Agnetha zu hören. Die Orchestrierung ist außerdem sehr gelungen."
5,"Dieser Sound erinnert mich an Australien.Total unkomplizier, easy listening. Die Band kommt ja von dort.Obwohl die Songs alle schon über 25 Jahre alt sind, ist der Sound immer noch toll!"
5,"Wir haben die CDs unserem Sohn(2 Jahre) zu Weihnachten geschenkt, seitdem laufen sie rauf und runter. Die Liederauswahl ist perfekt, nicht nur für Kinder. Wer hat in seiner Kindheit keinen Rolf Zuckowski gehört? Man kann sie nur weiterempfehlen und einem ans Herz legen!"
5,"Neustadts berühmter sprechender Elefant goes Wild West! Ein vielversprechender Titel mit einer sehr schönen Geschichte. Natürlich darf man hier keine große, komplexe Western-Story erwarten, mit wilden Schießereien und Showdown im Morgengrauen. Aber es ist alles drin, was man von einer Wild West - Geschichte erwartet, wenn man den Wilden Westen mit Kinderaugen sieht: Essen am Lagerfeuer, einer Geisterstadt mit Saloon, Drugstore etc., ein Sheriff und ein (sehr netter) Bandit. Und natürlich darf auch das berühmte Friede - Freude - Eierkuchen - Ende nicht fehlen. Der Lerneffekt der Folge fällt arg mager aus, dazu wird der Wilde Westen einfach zu verklärt dargestellt, aber die Geschichte ist sehr spannend, hat ihre lustigen Stellen und macht einfach Spaß. Man bekommt richtig Lust darauf, mit den Freunden in Ghost Town zu sein.  Edgar Ott spricht Benjamin Blümchen und er ist und bleibt einfach DER Benjamin Blümchen. Und wo Benjamin ist, da sind auch seine Freunde Otto (K. Primel) und Karla Kolumna (G. Fritsch) nicht weit. Alle Sprecher dieser Folge können auf ganzer Linie überzeugen. Erwähnenswert ist noch Gerd Duwner, der Onkel Hugo spricht. Wenn man genau hinhört, dann erkennt man ihn: als Ernie aus der Sesamstraße. Im Gegensatz zu vielen anderen Folgen, die auf Musik außer dem Titellied verzichten, gibt es in Benjamin als Sheriff doch einiges  mehr zu hören. In Onkel Hugos Auto läuft ein ""Countrysong"", der sehr vermutlich The heart of Texas trägt, aus mehr besteht der Text nämlich nicht, sehr lustig. Dann wird am Lagerfeuer Gitarre gespielt und ein kleines Lied gesungen. Fazit: Eine kindgerechte Western-Geschichte, die in Sachen Spannung so mancher Benjamin-Folge den Rang abläuft."
5,"Mit feeling good geht die Scheibe richtig gut los und gibt das Motto der Scheibe vor. Eingängiger Gesang begleitet von einem excellenten Pianisten führt den Hörer durch diese CD, die an keiner Stelle langweilig wirkt und mit seinem angenehmen Klang einfach nur Freude begleitet. Ja, da kommt wirklich gute Laune auf, man möchte sogleich eine Party starten. Rundum super produziert, sehr jazzig und nicht so balladenträchtig, wie man es von Randy Crawford in der letzten Zeit eher gewohnt war. Der Käufer wird nicht enttäuscht sein !  (Übrigens habe ich diese CD nur aufgrund guter Empfehlungen gekauft, die guten Kritiken kann ich bestätigen)"
5,"""Play mode""ist mein absolutes Lieblings-Album von Randy Crawford. Die CD beginnt mit dem wahnsinnig gefühlvollen ""Wild is the wind"". Kaum jemand kann einen Song so intensiv interpretieren, wie Randy Crawford. ""Merry go round"" lässt einen kaum noch los. Klasse die Uptempo-Nummer ""Permanent"". Absolut empfehlenswert ""All I do"" (Uptempo) und das einfühlsame ""When I get over you"" (einer meiner Lieblinssongs!). Randy Crawford macht aus jedem Song etwas besonderes. Das können nur wenige. Eine von ihnen ist Dionne Warwick. Und von ihr covert Randy auf dieser CD ""Alfie""."
5,"Als treuer, langjähriger ""ASPianer"" habe ich das neue Werk von ASP gleich bestellt und wurde, wie immer, nicht enttäuscht: Dunkle, elegische und dann wieder energievoll-rockige Passagen wechseln sich ab. Wer sich mit ASPs Texten beschäftigt, kann in eine eigene, tiefsinnige Welt abtauchen. Auch wie immer - Qualität setzt sich eben doch durch, wider dem gehypten Radio-Dudel-Abwasch-Pop. Danke, ASP."
1,Es war schon eine Berg- und Talfahrt der Gefühle:
2,"""A Songwriter's Tale "" bietet einige von Mike Batts bekanntesten Titeln und auch Neues. Allen Stücken ist gemeinsam, dass sie so richtig fett mit Zucker überschmalzt und Schmalz überzuckert sind. Das bekommt den Kompositionen, die bestenfalls gefällig sind, um nicht bösartig langweilig zu sagen , überhaupt nicht. Batts Interpretationen sprühen auch nicht gerade von knisternder Spannung, was sich vor allem bei seiner Version von ""The closest thing to crazy"" zeigt, welches er für Katie Melua geschrieben hat. Hier zeigt sich wieder einmal die Richtigkeit der regel ""It's the singer, not the song"". Ist dieser Titel bei Katie Melua eine schimmernde Pop-Perle, so sackt er bei Batt zur belanglosen Schmonzette ab. Viele Streicher und Flöten lassen diesem ALbum unnötig viel fett ansetzen und so sucht man bei den meisten Tracks ziemlich rasch die Skip-Taste und zieht schliesslich diese CD am Ende schnell aus dem Player heraus."
5,"Diese Waters-Cd ist absolut genial. Und zwar sowohl kompositorisch als auch musikalisch. Stünde ""Pink Floyd"" darauf, und würde Mr. Gilmour die Gitarrensoli spielen, dann wären 15 Sterne zuwenig. Schade, daß man diese Musik nur noch wenig hörte, ich weiss auch, daß Mr. Waters ein schwieriger mensch ist. Dennoch: Bei allem respekt zu David Gilmour: seine Island -CD von 2005 ist und bleibt ein kompletter Langweiler. Nur live in Gdansk lohnt sich wieder, als Erinnerung an den seeligen Mr. Wright ein sehr schönes Gefühl. Wären sich die Floyds 1992 einig gewesen, diese Scheibe hätte sich millionenfach verkauft, und verdient hätte sie es auch, es ist Brachialrock der wohl besten Musiker ( kompositorisch...nicht musikalisch) auf Erden! Kaufen und Vorurteile vergessen!"
5,"Er kam, sang und siegte.  Ich habe die CD gestern bekommen, habe sie mir bisher zweimal angehört, und bin total begeistert. Richtig gute Swing-Musik und obendrei noch witzige Texte. Spätestens bei ""Murphys Gesetz"" dürfte auch der größte Kritiker überzeugt sein."
5,"Wer die vielen Seiten von Gerhard Schöne kennt, weiß auch, daß er immer für Überraschungen gut ist. Mit dieser CD rückt er dem Hörer gnadenlos auf die Pelle: Zuhören oder abschalten. Weghören oder mal so nebenbei geht nicht. Man mag verschiedener Ansicht sein über seine Art zu instrumentieren, es gibt sicher bessere Stimmen und schöner aussehende Figuren. Aber ich kenne keinen in der deutschen Liedermacherszene, die mit so viel einfacher menschlicher Wärme bei gleichzeitiger klarer Position die Probleme unserer Zeit aufs Korn nehmen. Wer Ohren hat zu hören, der höre."
2,"Wie jetzt? Eine Best Of? Von Oasis? Sollte es die nicht erst dann geben, wenn Ihre heilige Britpopigkeit das Zeitliche gesegnet hat? Müssen wir jetzt Stoßgebete aussenden? Oder ist es schon zu spät? Fragen über Fragen und eine simple Antwort: Oasis schuldeten ihrem alten Label Sany BNG (Name von der Redaktion geändert) noch eine Platte. Die wollten aus absahntechnischen Gründen ein Best Of. Oasis hatten die Wahl: mit oder ohne eigene Zustimmung. Man (eigentlich nur Noel Gallagher) entschied sich für Letzteres und kompilierte aufs Geratewohl 18 Songs zusammen. Nicht für uns, nein, sondern für die Kids in 50 Jahren. Für die sei diese Platte gedacht. Sagt Noel. Und hat Recht. In der Zukunft mag man sich freuen über diese günstige Gelegenheit, Oasis kompakt kennen lernen zu dürfen. Mit ein bisschen Glück könnte ""Stop The Clocks"" sogar das rote/blaue Album der Beatles für eien neue Generation werden. Für Fans im Hier und Jetzt jedenfalls lohnt sich die Anschaffung nicht. Man hat eh alles zu Hause stehen. Überhaupt! 18 Songs. Pah! Mindestens doppelt so viele vermisst man schon beim reinen Tracklist-Überfliegen. Wo ist denn bitte sehr ""Whatever""? Warum war ""Little By Little"" nicht gut genug? Was ist mit ""Shakermaker oder ""Bring It On Down? Und ""Roll With It fehlt nicht wirklich? Oder doch? Tatsache! Ausgeklammert wie auch das komplette ""Be Here Now""-Album, das gar nicht so schlecht sein kann wie sein Ruf. Genau genommen ist es sogar ziemlich gut. Aber das will ja eh keiner zugeben. Nun ja, wenigstens ""Slide Away"", seit Anfangstagen ein ewiger Fan-Favorit, hat es auf ""Stop The Clocks"" geschafft. Gratulation! Aber eigentlich ist es Wurscht. Wer Oasis will, sollte um dieses lieblos zusammengestoppelte Song-Konglomerat einen Bogen machen. Selbst Noel Gallagher ist diese Werkschau - Zitat - ""scheißegal"". Die regulären Alben der nach eigener Aussage ""größten und besten Band der Welt"" kosten schon längst keine Welt mehr. Hier sollte man beherzt zugreifen, so denn daheim noch musikalische Schandlücken vorhanden sind. Alles andere ist eh Schmarrn. Daran ändert auch die opulent ausgestattete Vinyl-Ausgabe nichts. Warten wir lieber auf das Jahr 2008. Dann soll eventuell vielleicht ein neues Oasis-Werk in die Läden kommen. Bring it on! You know were mad fer it!- Michael Seifert -"
1,"Gut ich gebe es zu der Genre : Triphop ist schwierig aber denoch man kann was daraus machen ! leider nicht wie bei archive ! ihre music ist nur wenig interesant ! jedes lied gleicht in punkto rythmus und beats hargenau ! Die Rapeinlagen sind ebenfalls eine nervensache : soll heissen es ist in keinster weise MUSICSTRUKTUR da ! Es ist so leidig es auch ist einfach zu wenig , zu langweilig und einfach musiclos ! Sorry !"
1,"Nachdem ich das wirklich ausgezeichnete Livealbum ""Seconds Out"" wiederentdeckt habe, wuchs der Wunsch nach mehr Live-Material von Genesis. Durch die hier abgedruckten Kritiken habe ich mir ""three sides live"" zugelegt. Fazit: Jämmerlich, einzig ""The Cage"" ist hörenswert, wenn man wie ich, die fantastischen Songstrukturen der alten Genesis mag. (Sicher auch die ersten zwei Alben mit Collins als Leadsänger sind OK) aber alles was danach kommt, und das findet sich ja hier auf dem Album ist so glatt und uninteressant, dass ich vom Kauf abraten muss, es sei denn man mag das. Gestern habe ich dann über einen Kollegen die 4-fach CD ""Archives"" erhalten mit einem kompletten Live-Set von 1975 ""Lamb lies down on Broadway"". Was für ein Unterschied, was für eine genial Band!"
2,"Voller Vorfreude habe ich das Album (aus Übersee) erwartet, doch leider war ich nach dem ersten Hören bitter enttäuscht. Ich hatte mich auf ein Album, das in Lynne's Fußstapfen wandelt gefreut. Präsentiert wird aber ein einfallsloser Abklatsch, der bis ins kleinste Detail immer und immer wieder repliziert wird. Mit anderen Worten: Es klingt alles ziemlich gleich. Dazu kommt, man hat das alles schon mal gehört, abzüglich des fehlenden Charmes des Originals. Die Songs die nicht ins E.L.O. Schema fallen konnten nicht begeistern. Auch die Hoffnung die geniale Stimme Andy Sturmers zu hören wurde nicht erfüllt. Er singt nur eine einzige kurze Passage und etwas Background. Man hätte ihn mehr singen lassen sollen, da die Stimme von Bleu eher unspektakulär ist. Des weiteren wurde in einer Art und Weise ""geborgt"", dass man eine Urheberrechtsklage befürchten muss. So ist der Anfang von ""ya had me goin"" fast identisch mit ""Evil Woman"" und der Soundeffekt von Titel 10 ""sukaz are born every minute"" von ""Starlight"" entnommen. Es ist erstaunlich wie genau die typischen Jeff Lynne-Sounds nachgeahmt wurden. Bei den Drums besonders, sowie den Gitarrensounds. Wirklich schade, dass u.a. so geniale Soundtüftler und Songschreiber der ehemaligen Jellyfish Band es nicht geschafft haben etwas eigenständiges im E.L.O-Style zu erschaffen."
5,"Die CD ""Ich Denke, Also Sing ich(Unterwegs)"" enthält hauptsächlich Aufnahmen Bodo Wartkes Tour ""Ich Denke, Also Sing Ich"" und diese Tour hat's in sich! Der unvergleichliche Humor des Künstlers, der den Einen oder Anderen schon mal dazu bringt am Lachen fast zu ersticken wird durch die Professionalität der Begleitung am Klavier teilweise noch übertroffen. Für diejenigen die denken: toll schön und gut bisschen klimpern, dann nen kleinen Joke das kann ja jeder. Aber Bodo Wartke vermag dies gleichzeitig zu tun und das in einer Art und Weise, die schon mit unzähligen Preisen, wie z.B. dem Deutschen Kleinkunstpreis 2003 geehrt wurde. Gleichzeitig hat auch noch einen zusätzlich entscheidenen Vorteil. Zitat(Bodo Wartke): ""Andernfalls würde es zum Beispiel doppelt so lange dauern"". Allerdings enthält die CD auch Songs, die man selbst auf der Tour nicht zu hören bekommt. Es lohnt sich also auch für diejenigen, die auf der Tour waren und meinen sie würden alles schon kennen. In den Liedern(wie zum Beispiel in ""Ein Denkmal denkt"") sind aber auch Teile enthalten die ausschließlich zum Nachdenken anregen sollen. Also nicht erschrecken: Es handelt sich ja um Kabarett und nich um Comedy, in der, um abschließend mit den Worten des Künstlers zu sprechen, diese ""leisen lyrischen Momente"" fehlen."
5,"Sehnlichst wurde der dritte Teil dieser hervorragenden Zusammenstellung erwartet. Nun ist er da. Auch diesmal sind wieder Perlen des ""Kraut-Rock's"" drauf. Was unter anderem vom Rudi Vogel ausgegraben wurde sind acht Stunden Musik ohne langeweile. Allerdings so ganz unklar ist mir, was ein Udo Lindenberg auf diesem Sampler zu Suchen hat. Er gehört m.e. nach nicht unter die Rubrik Kraut-Rock. Aber dies wäre der einzige Titel der aus der Reihe springt. Als besonders interessant habe ich Wolfgang Dauner Track empfunden. Nicht Jazz ist hier dominant sonder ein kräftiger Einschlag Psychedelic. Übrigens wer nicht bis Ende Januar 2009 warten will, kann diesen Sampler schon unter ""Green Brain"" bei Rudi Vogel bestellen."
4,"ich habe diese CD vorallem gekauft, weil sich das sehr selten gepresste ""oh well"" darauf befindet. Es ist für mich einer der originellsten Songs der Pop/Rock Geschichte! Insgesamt ist die CD sehr abwechslungsreich ganz in Stil der alten Fleetwood Mac, noch mit dem unverkennbaren Peter Green. Sicher ein Muss für Liebhaber dieses Musikrichtung!"
5,"Konnte zwar in die Lieder bisher nur jeweils 30 Sekunden reinhören, aber was ich da gehört habe ist perfekt!!! ""Unverwundbar"" war schon ein Album was wirklich der Hammer war, und das neue Album ""Männer sind Krieger"" geht für mich ebenso auf. Der Kerl der hier einen Stern für das Album gegeben hat, hat entweder keine Ahnung von Matthias Reim oder er soll vielleicht seinen Musikgeschmack ändern!!!  Wer das Album ""Unverwunbar"" geil fand, wird mit der neuen Scheibe ""Männer sind Krieger"" genauso viel Spaß haben!!! EINFACH GEIL !!! MATZE EINFACH GEIL !!!"
5,"Nun, was ist so besonders an dieser Musik. Ich möchte ein Beispiel geben: Gleich im ersten Lied kommt die Zeile vor 'Then I'll dig a tunnel from my window to yours, Yeah, a tunnel from my window to yours...Sänger Win Butler singt die Zeile folgendermaßen: '...from my windowdiyo[urs]'. Dieses Wortspiel klingt so treibend, so unverkrampft so fantastisch, das es einen schier umhaut. Man möchte nur noch diese Zeile hören, der Rest ist Beiwerk. Genau solche Schlüsselszenen begeistern mich in der Musik, mir geht es genauso wenn ich ein klassisches Stück im Streichquartett spiele. Wenn man sich dann näher auf die Platte einlässt, entfaltet sich die ganze Schönheit. Die Streicher, die Chöre, all das ist einfach wunderbar. Ich empfinde den Gesang nicht als störend, sondern er passt sehr gut zu dieser Musik. Bei Clap your Hands say Yeah hingegen finde ich den Gesang einfach nur schrecklich, unpassend und nervig, nicht so hier. Die Stücke klingen mitunter tragisch, herzergreifend und melancholisch, auch live ein echter Genuss, da Sie sich mächtig ins Zeug legen. Großartig. Bis denn"
5,"Es ist schon viel gesagt und geschrieben worden über den lang erwarteten Zweitling der kanadischen Intelligenz-Folkrocker Arcade Fire. Die Feuilletons sind voll des Lobes, im Internet schwärmen hingerissene bis tränenüberströmte Fans, die meisten Rundfunksender machen die CD zum Album der Woche, des Monats, des Jahres.  Und, kaum zu glauben, aber wahr: Alle Hymnen sind völlig berechtigt. ""Neon Bible"" hängt die Messlatte für die beste Platte des Jahres 2007 schon Anfang März sehr sehr hoch. Ein Meisterwerk - wesentlich ausgereifter, melodiöser und zugänglicher als das vielleicht doch etwas überschätzte Debüt ""Funeral"".  Eine ""Track-by-track""-Rezension: ""Black Mirror"" entwickelt sich aus einer Art Sturmrauschen und beginnt verhalten-düster (der dumpf-dräuende Sound entspricht der Stimmung des Songs), ehe sich aus einem dichten Geflecht von Gitarren, Bass, Schlagzeug und Klavier die Stimmen der AF-Masterminds Win Butler und Regine Chassagne herausschälen. Nach zweieinhalb Minuten dann die so typischen Streicher zum bitteren Schlüsselsatz ""Mirror mirror on the wall, show me where the bombs will fall"". Spätestens hier ist klar: Für oberflächliche Spaßvögel ist ""Neon Bible"" nicht die richtige Platte. ""Keep the car running"" macht zum ersten Mal klar, warum viele Kritiker das Album mit den frühen Meisterwerken von Bruce Springsteen vergleichen. Der treibende Rhythmus und Win Butlers Vocals sind nahe beim ""Boss"", und um Autos geht's im Text ja auch. Ein fantastischer Song. Das Titelstück ist das unscheinbarste der elf Lieder. Zu sanften Streichern und etwas Schlagzeug ein mantra-artiger Gesang. Schön - und schnell vorbei. Die Spannung entlädt sich mit ""Imagination"" - nicht nur wegen seiner gewaltigen, den Song dominierenden Kirchenorgel für viele der Höhepunkt des Albums. Hier singt Win Butler selbstbewusst wie der junge Springsteen von ""Born To Run"", während Bass und Drums auf den Refrain mit himmlischen Frauenchören zutreiben. ""Black wave/Bad vibrations"" ist schon vom Titel her ein besonders dunkles Arcade-Fire-Stück, und man wird diesen Eindruck trotz des hellen Leadgesangs von Regine Chassagne nie los. Im zweiten Teil des Songs übernimmt wieder Win Butler zu wummernden Bass-Riffs die Führung - die Weltsicht der Kanadier kann nicht die optimistischste gewesen sein, als sie ""Neon Bible"" in einer alten Kirche bei Montreal einspielten. Etwas versöhnlicher danach die Klavier-Ballade ""Ocean of noise"", wo Butler seinem Vorbild David Byrne recht nahe kommt. Gegen Ende des Songs sorgen die majestätischen Bläser von Calexico fast für so etwas wie Mariachi-Flair. Traumhaft. ""The well and the lighthouse"" ist wieder so ein treibender, an der Grenze zur Hysterie balancierender AF-Song mit all der Grandezza, für die diese Band so geliebt und bewundert wird. Nach gut zwei Minuten geht's plötzlich in eine neue, hochmelodramatische Richtung, auf die man erst mal kommen muss. Danach wird's endgültig Bruce-lastig, aber wie unpeinlich und würdevoll Arcade Fire das hinbekommen! Das wortreiche ""Antichrist television blues"" ist die schönste Hommage an Springsteen ever. Die Band packt alles rein, was an Energie und Schönklang in ihr steckt. Nach abrupt abbrechenden fünf Song-Minuten denkt man: Was kann jetzt noch kommen? Und dann kommt doch noch ein Trio von Liedern mit so vielen Ideen und unerhörten Klang-Details, dass andere, schwächere Bands daraus wohl mindestens drei Alben gemacht hätten. Das wuchtige ""Windowsill"", wieder mit einem prächtigen Streicher- und Bläserarrangement, kraftvollem Chorgesang und Win Butlers definitiver MTV-Verdammnis; danach das unglaubliche ""No cars go"" mit U2-Gitarren, einem unerbittlich vorwärtsstampfenden Bass, Akkordeon, Orchester, Soldatenchor, ""Hey!""-und ""Go!""-Ausrufen - ein Festschmaus für die Ohren. Zum Schluss noch mal die Kirchenorgel als Hauptdarstellerin von ""My body is a cage"", das ganz schlicht beginnt und sich zu einer Kathedrale von Song aufschichtet. Nach gut einer dreiviertel Stunde ""Neon Bible"" ist man ein anderer Mensch, wurde über diese Platte geschrieben, die sich in ihrer überwältigenden Wucht nur mit dem letztjährigen Opus magnum der Guillemots (""Through the Windowpane"") vergleichen lässt. Wie auch immer man das sieht - jedenfalls werden wir uns an diesem Maßstäbe setzenden, hoch anspruchsvollen Album noch lange abarbeiten können."
1,"Ich habe gerade eine sehr negative Rezension über dieses Album geschrieben, weil die Stücke, wegen der ich es gekauft hatte, einfach furchtbar klangen. Ich habe jetzt in Ruhe die ganze CD nochmal angehört und berichtige: I feel free, NSU: so leise aufgenommen, daß der Charakter nicht rauskommt: einfach mit Nero auf doppelt so laut (mindestens!) umschneiden. I'm so glad: leider nicht reparierbar, total übersteuert toad, Spoonfull, rollin and tumblin, cat's squirrel: voll OK"
2,"Sind die ersten 30 Folgen fas alle zu empfhlen,ist dies hier doch die schwächste.Es kommt einfach keine Spanunng auf,die Geschichte ist langweilig und vorhersehbar. Da gibt es eindeutig besseres!"
1,"Das ist wirklich nur was für Hardcore Rose Tattoo Fans. Mit AC/DC haben die Herren ausser der Herkunft nix am Hut.War Angry Andersson und Rest bei den kultigen Klassikern The butcher and fast Eddy oder Rock`n`Roll Outlaw noch richtig gut in Form, klingen Rose Tattoo 2002 vollständig überholt. Ideenlose Songstrukturen treffen auf einen zahnlosen Gesang. Vielleicht wollten die ""Jungs"" ja auch nur die Rente aufbessern - ist ja auch egal jedenfalls nochmals: Finger weg!"
5,"Schwieriges Album. Düster, spärlich, sperrig, abweisend, kalt und entrückt sind Worte, die mir hierzu in den Sinn kommen. Sehr gewöhnungsbedürftiges, aber ungemein faszinierendes Kunstwerk. Es ist offensichtlich, dass Nico viel mehr drauf hatte, als man nach ihrem Gastpiel bei Velvet Underground hätte meinen können. Wer anspruchsvolle, avantgardistische Musik mag, dem sei diese Scheibe unbedingt empfohlen!"
5,"Massive Attack klingen jetzt anders als zuvor ( bei ""Blue Lines"" ).Das soll kein Vorwurf sein , sondern ein Kompliment ! Aus Trip-Hop wird nun eine Mischung aus Chill-Out-Musik und dem vorher genannten Musikstil.Dieses Album ist sozusagen genial ! ""Karmacoma"" und ""Protection"" sind die besten Songs des Albums . Jeder echte MA-Fan sollte sich das Album zulegen !"
5,"Bisher bin ich immer an lamb irgendwie vorbei gekommen. Nun, bei diesem Abschiedsprojekt hat es mich doch noch gepackt. Und  wie!! Ich höre fast nur noch diese CD, finde alle hier versammelten Songs gelungen, wirklich das Beste ist hier zusammengetragen.  Leider ist es bei einer Combilation ja so üblich, die Texte nicht mehr mitzuliefern, die sich auch lohnen zu kennen. Dafür gibt es aber ja das Internet, man muss einfach etwas suchen und ""here you are!""  Was ich sehr gut finde sind die Statements von Andy und Lou, wie sie selbst zu diesen Songs stehen und wie sie zustande gekommen sind! Eine gute Ergänzung bietet auch die DVD mit den Vidios von lamb, das rundet das Bild zu einem wahrhaften Kunstwerk ab und bereichert den Eindruck mancher Songs noch... besonders B-line, ein recht schräger Song, wird so abgerundet durch das sehr gelungene und witzige Vidio.  Gorecki ist wirklich auch für mich eines der schönsten Liebeslieder überhaupt (schön, dass sich da so viele einig sind!!), die Melodie past perfekt zu den wunderbaren Worten, die Lou so gut darbringt, dass man beinahe alles versteht!! Und dann das schon so oft auf Chillout-Combilations gehörte und nie überhörte Lullaby, sanft und tief, umwerfend einfach und doch -mehr..."
5,"Bei Linkin Park fehlen mir irgendwie die richtigen Worte. Ist 'ne supergeile Band und Shadow of the day ist mein absoluter Lieblingssong. Und soeben habe ich eine Coverversion von diesem Song gehört und ich bin voll und ganz begeistert, wie genial Thomas Godoj diesen Song gecovert hat!!!!!!!!!!! Ich kann Minutes to Midnight nur jedem empfehlen! Linkin Park ist 'ne geile Band, der Sänger hat 'ne Superstimme und nicht nur Shadow of the day ist 'n absolut geiler Song, sondern der Rest auch. Und schaut euch die DVD an: echt geil!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Für diese geile Band gibt's natürlich fünf Sterne mit ******!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Pete"
5,"wenn man genau liest weiß man ,dass die cd minutes to midnight mit einigen bonusliedern ist! ich finde alle ausnahmslos alle (ok der what i've done remix is doch etwas wunderlich:) der lp qualität entsprechen und live sind die jungs eh eine der besten bands der welt! ich verstehe nicht warum man für diese cd weniger als 5 sterne geben kann und sie als schrott bezeichnet wenn man sie doch eigentlich gut findet? naja, 5 sterne mehr brauch ich nicht zu sagen!"
2,"Der Titel droht bereits an, wohin die Reise geht: direkt hinein ins gefährliche, weil allzu oft schlicht langweilige Reich des Disco-Funk. Damit verlässt Jay nun endgültig seine musikalische Heimat, die ihm einst Ruhm und Ehre bescherte. Nur noch sehr verhalten klingen jene Elemente an, welche vor ca. 8 Jahren die Szene bewundernd aufhorchen ließen: genial mit Jazz und Easy Listening versetzte Pop-Perlen mit Herz, Power und der richtigen Dosis Gefühl, dargeboten von erstklassigen Musikern."
5,"Def Leppard beweisen mit diesem Album, das Melodie und Härte nicht gleich Bon Jovi sein muß (die frühen B.J.-Scheiben mal ausgenommen...;-). Wahrlich coole Songs, mit genialen Hooklines werden hier mit ordentlicher Power vermählt und von geilen Gitarrensolis gekrönt. Auch die ruhigen Momente geraten göttlich. Sicher bringt der Gesang eine gewisse Theatralik mit ins Spiel; ...wer sich dran stört... TOP Klassiker der in jede ernsthafte Sammlung gehört... Gruß und viel Fun damit!"
5,"Ich hatte so etwas wie eine Mid-Tempo-Krise - irgendwie schien es so, als wären unsere Alben immer langsamer geworden"", hat Vince Clarke neulich gesagt. Nun, wenn man die neue Single des Pop-Duos aus dem Album Light At The End Of The World"" (Mute, VÖ: Mai 2007) hört, weiß man: Diese Krise ist überstanden. I Could Fall In Love With You"" ist eine absolut packende Popnummer, ein Ohrwurm, wie ihn eben nur Vince Clarke und Sänger Andy Bell schreiben können. Der Sound knüpft nahtlos an die erlesenen Synthetik-Klänge früherer Alben an, etwa an Cowboy"", I Say I Say I Say"" und gelegentlich auch an das legendäre Album Chorus"", einem Meilenstein der elektronischen Musik. Das gesamte Album indes kann nicht ganz die Erwartungen erfüllen, die sein Vorgänger Nightbird"" (Januar 2005) geweckt hat, zu simple, zu belanglos klingen die Stücke von Light At The End Of The World"" bisweilen. Die Eleganz mit der die Nightbird""-Stücke nicht nur loyale Erasure-Enthusiasten, sondern auch etliche andere Freunde des synthetischen Pops begeistert haben, ist dieser Studioproduktion abhanden gekommen. In ihrer Naivität erinnern die neuen Songs gelegentlich an das Debütalbum Erasures, Wonderland"" (1985). Die Stücke im einzelnen: Sunday Girl Vocoder-Effekte, dann ein brillanter Auftakt mit röhrendem Synthie-Sound à la Vince Clarke. Packender, treibender Beat, tolle Melodie, die sofort mitreißt. Man freut sich auf einen tollen Popsong. Doch dann ertönt der Refrain: Is This The Way To Amarillo?"". Ja, tatsächlich klingt der wichtigste Teil des Stückes wie jener Oldie von Tony Christie, den wohl jeder schon mal auf einer rauschenden Karnevalsparty oder bierseligen Schlagerparade mitgegrölt hat. Wer das Christie-Machwerk einmal im Ohr hat, der wird sich an Sunday Girl"" nie wieder erfreuen können. Was für eine Schande. I Could Fall In Love With You Ohne Frage eine Klasse-Single und die perfekte Auftaktauskopplung. Jedoch reichen die Radio-Versionen von Jeremy Wheatley und Monteverde längst nicht an die geniale Albumversion heran, die wesentlich markanter, erdiger und erasure-iger daherklingt. Eine packende Popnummer, die nur so vor Energie und guter Laune sprüht und sich mit erlesenen Vince Clarke-Sounds im Gehörgang festsaugt. Sucker For Love Billiger Techno-Pop von der übelsten Sorte, schnödes Gestampfe, schauerlicher Refrain - ein Song, den die Welt nicht braucht. Sucker For Love"" ist wohl der schnellste Song des Albums - Hotte! Hotte! Hotte!"" - und daher ist zu befürchten, dass die für Missgriffe bekannte Plattenfirma von Erasure dieses Highspeed-Galopp-Geblubber zur zweiten Single kürt. Erbarmen, bitte nicht! Billiger und blöder geht's nicht. Ein überflüssiger Song"". Storm In A Teacup Ohne Frage, die beste Ballade, die Erasure jemals geschrieben haben, und mithin einer der besten Erasure-Songs aller Zeiten. Fantastischer Gesang über brodelnden Synthesizer-Soundlandschaften, die ständig in Bewegung sind und beim Anhören über Kopfhörer ständig Neues offenbaren. Ein betörender Song, der nicht mehr aus dem Kopf gehen will, nahezu hypnotisch ist er. Bewegend aber auch der sehr persönliche Text, in dem sich Andy Bell mit seiner offenbar schwierigen Kindheit auseinandersetzt. Neben I Could Fall In Love With You"" eine Perle auf diesem Album. Fly Away Ein schöner Popsong mit Ohrwurm-Charakter und vielen herrlichen Sounds, die allerdings von etwas zu viel Bass getrübt werden. Insgesamt ein sehr simples Arrangement - kein Song, den man erst nehmen muss. Spaß macht er trotzdem, vor allem der Refrain gefällt. Golden Heart Eine Erasure-Nummer, wie sie auf dem Cowboy""-Album hätte auftauchen können - treibend, schnell, kribbelnd mit prägnantem Refrain. Immer wieder baut sich dieser Song neu auf und setz sich so unweigerlich im Gehörgang fest. Zum Schluss gibt es Vince Clarke-Sounds, wie sie schöner kaum sein könnten. How My Eyes Adore You Ui, was ist das denn? Erasure? Tiefer Groove, beinahe schon Drum'n'Bass, dazu gospelartiger Gesang - eine echte Hymne, sehr elegisch, elektrisierend, euphorisierend. Gehört - mit I Could Fall In Love With You"" und Storm In A Teacup"" - zu den Top-Drei dieses Albums. Ein völlig neuer Sound für Erasure - grandios. Darlene Reiht sich perfekt an How My Eyes Adore You"" an - pumpende Bassbeats, sparsame Instrumentierung, ganz auf Andy Bells großartigen Gesang hin produziert. Eine für Erasure erneut sehr ungewöhnliche Mid-Tempo-Nummer mit schönem Text und eingängigem Chorus. Auch darf Andy Bell mal wieder Falsett singen ... When A Lover Leaves You Perlender Auftakt, signalartige Synthie-Sounds, die schnell in den Song leiten, eine schöne Melodie baut sich auf, eine klassische Erasure-Ballade im Stil von I Bet You're Mad At Me"", Surreal"", I Love You"" oder Because You're So Sweet"", zartschmelzender Refrain - simpel und schön. Glass Angel Schwer zugänglicher, komplizierter Song mit sperrigem Sound, der erst nach mehrfachem Hören Zugang gewährt - erneut ein intimes Spiegelbild des Seelenlebens von Andy Bell. Musikalisch ist Glass Angel"" schwer einzuordnen - rauschende Sounds, treibende Beats, spärliche Instrumentierung - vom Stil her erinnert das Stück an Treasure"" vom Cowboy""-Album, hat etwas Epochales. Glass Angel"" im Ohr zu behalten, fällt ziemlich schwer."
2,"Es ist sicherlich keine leichte Aufgabe, aus einem gerade mal durchschnittlichen Album, welches bei weitem nicht die erhofften Verkaufszahlen erreicht hat, mehrere 'Hitsingles' herauszupressen. Leider ist hier die Wahl bei der dritten Single auf einen der schlechtesten Songs des Albums 'X' gefallen. Langweilig, einfallslos, ohne Erkennungswert, fast schon nervig. Auch die Remixe reissen in diesem Fall überhaupt nichts raus, der 'Death Metal Disco Scene Mix' ist einfach schrottig. Hätte das Label doch 'The One' ausgekoppelt, damit könnte man sicherlich auch die langjährigen Fans bei Laune halten. 'Wow' bekommt die 2 Sterne auch wirklich nur für's Video."
1,"Nichts ist von Cold geblieben!!!! Hatten die Alben seit dem Debüt schon nachgelassen, so ist dieses wirklich das Schlechteste. Es lässt sich kurz beschreiben ""Einerlei"". Das braucht wirklich niemand!Für mich ist und bleib das Debütalbum immer noch das Beste."
2,"Die gealterten Pseudo Punker von Green Day versuchen es mal mit, sagen wir es mal freundlich - einer Sixties Garage Platte - unter dem tollen Pseudonym Foxboro Hot Tubs. Leider hört man vom ersten Takt an, dass sich Green Day hinter diesem Projekt verstecken und mit ihrem Song ""Mother Mary"" versuchen sie verzweifelt gegen die hierzulande angesagte Schweden-Combo Mando Diao oder gar den Hives anzustinken. Aber das können sie genauso wenig wie authentischen Punkrock. Auch der Einsatz der ach so beliebten ""Schweineorgel"" lässt sie nicht an die Qualitäten von Bands wie den Fuzztones oder den Miricale Workers herankommen. Einzig und allein das CD Layout überzeugt mich. Die CD kommt im einfachen Pappschuber und ist stilistisch dem 60er Jahre-Look entsprechend, wenn da nicht dieser blöde Barcode wäre könnte man glatt meinen das Teil wäre echt alt. Alles in allem reicht es bei mir aber nicht für mehr als zwei Sterne, da der Inhalt der CD mich schnell gelangweilt hat."
1,Ich war immer ein großer Backstreet Boys Fan aber dieses Album klingt wie ein schlechtes Dance Album aus den 90igern...Schade das die Jungs aus Ihrem Talent nicht mehr machen...
5,"Es ist wohl kaum möglich einen Kettcar Bericht zu finden, indem nicht auf die Geschichte einiger Bandmitglieder eingegangen wird, auch wir werden keine Ausnahme machen, die Namen ...ButAlive und Rantanplan werden hiermit in einem Halbsatz genannt. Aber es ist viel zu Schade Platz und Zeit auf die alten Projekte dieser Hamburger 'Boyband' zu verwenden, denn die Gegenwart ist viel zu schön. Es ist Pop: aber kein 08-15 SingSang mit Chartambitionen, sondern Musik mit Tiefgang, mit Texten, die nicht nur aussergewöhnlich gut sind, sonder auch auf jeden irgendwie zutreffen können und Melodien, die sich in deinem Hirn festbrennen werden. Wir werden Konzerte erleben auf denen das komplette Publikum jedes einzele Wort mitsingen kann, wir würden eher unsere Eltern als diese Platte verkaufen und wir werden vor Freude weinen wollen.  Zugegeben, die harten Männer unter unseren Lesern werden sicher nicht weinen, ""Männer weinen nicht"" by The Wohlstandskinder"
2,"""Ich möchte trösten, Eine Party-Platte könnte ich gar nicht machen."" (Annette Humpe) Also macht Ich + Ich das, was sie - wie sie schon auf ihrem selbstbetitelten Debüt 2005 bewiesen haben - am besten können: Popmusik für Erwachsene, melancholisch und tröstend, dabei stets bemüht, zeitgemäß im Sound zu klingen.  Und genau das ist das Problem des neuen Albums: Manachmal klingen sie ungewöhnlich fröhlich, da könnte man denken ""juhu, ein bisschen Abwechslung"" aber irgendwie merkt man Adel Tawil den Spaß, den er dabei, wie er in Interviews verkündet, hatte, nicht unbedingt an.  Ansonsten das Übliche: Dass wir alle vom selben Stern sind, ein Lied in Form eines Gebets und - nachdem dieses Lied so wie das gesamte Album damals 1990 floppte - ein Humpe Lied aus dem Jahre 1990 (""Wenn ich tot bin"") Gottlob lassen sich Fans nicht vom kauf abhalten, für alle anderen gilt: Dieses Album muss man nicht unbedingt besitzen!"
5,"Ich habe mich sehr vom Gesamtbild dieser CD beeindrucken lassen. Gabriel hat endlich mal ein Experiment gewagt, was bemerkenswert ist."
5,Bei diesem Album war ich vom ersten hören an einfach hin und weg. Sie hat nicht nur Hammer Songs ist auch von der Aufmachung bis hin zur Qualität einfach super gelungen. Hab gar nicht erst angefangen zu zählen wie oft ich diese CD schon durchgehört habe. Garantiert eine zweistellige Zahl. Nur zu empfehlen denn diese CD ist die absolut BESTE Hosen LIVE CD die es gibt. Ich kann dazu nichts weiter sagen als EINFACH NUR GEIL. Regelrechte KAUFPFLICHT.
2,"Mia!!! Was ist los Mieze Katz?? Kann man es denn wirklich so verlernen gute Musik zu machen? Wo ist die wilde Mieze? Wo sind die genialen Lieder? Was ist los mit Euch? Bin sehr enttäuscht. Hoffe, das nächste Mal wirds wieder besser, wilder, ideenreicher. Schade."
4,"Okay, die Vorgänger-CD war nicht schlecht, aber irgendwie etwas zu eintönig, zu melancholisch..... Endlich greifen Pendragon mal wieder in die Kiste, aus der Stücke zu den Alben ""The World"" oder ""Masquerade"" reiften.... Da ist endlich mal wieder ein bißchen Drive drin, das 21-minütige Stück ""Wishing well""ist vergleichbar mit ""The last man on earth"" von der ""Window of life"", abwechslungsreich und spannend, gnadenlos gut !!!! Aus dem letzten Stück der CD ""Edge"" hätte man mehr machen können und vielleicht auch sollen, da fehlt irgendwas..... Aber ansonsten....kaufen, kaufen, kaufen!!!"
5,"Bombastheavyprogressivrock, der die Sinne berauscht! Auch wenn man ein Dream-Theater-Neuling ist (wie ich), dieses Album ist auf jeden Fall eine akustische ""Reise"" wert!!!"
2,"Nachdem Octavarium an vielen Stellen enttäuscht hatte, mir Train of Thought aber überwiegend trotz des musikalischen Sprunges der Band wirklich gefallen hat, war ich sehr gespannt, was das neunte Album der ""Speerspitze des Progressive Metal"" bringen würde. Anfangs ließ ich zu, dass meine Euphorie über das neue Album meinen Blick trübte, erst nachdem ich wirklich aufmerksam nach einigen Anläufen die Musik unter die Lupe nahm, kam ich zu der Entscheidung, dass hier eigentlich noch weniger als auf Octavarium geboten wird. Klar, technisch ist alles perfekt, die Virtuosität sticht wie immer heraus, und jeder der Musiker kann sich hier austoben (auch wenn ich mir bei Myung da nicht so ganz sicher bin). Und auch Freunde langer Lieder werden entzückt sein, denn das kürzeste Lied ist bereits fünfeinhalb Minuten lang.  Aber nun zum Album. Der Anfang klingt direkt ein wenig gekünstelt, die einleitende Instrumentalpassage kann nicht wirklich überzeugen. Es wird aber gleich besser, sobald der Gesang einsetzt, die Harmonien passen, auch wenn man vergeblich nach der gewissen DT-Essenz sucht. Die Zeit geht schnell vorbei, eigentlich ein gutes Zeichen. Auch die Steigerung gegen Ende des Liedes, mit Gitarre/Synth-Duo zum Schluss macht Freude. Die Harmonien werden immer spannungsgeladener, und insgesamt ist ""In The Presence Of Enemies pt. 1"" ein sehr gelungenes Lied. Die gute Leistung wird allerdings nicht aufrecht gehalten. ""Forsaken"" nervt mich einfach, tat es schon beim ersten hören. Hier fehlt mir die Inspiration, das Lied ist sehr einfach gestrickt, die Kadenzen sind ekelhaft Pop/Rockig und nichtssagend. Gut, dass es sich hier um das kürzeste Lied des Albums handelt, und da es keine großen Veränderungen während des Liedes gibt, gibt es auch nicht mehr zu sagen. Es folgt ""Constant Motion"". Wie auch der Beginn von ""In The Presence Of Enemies"" klingt hier das Intro stark gekünstelt, als hätte man zwanghaft versucht, etwas hartes und rhythmisch interessantes hervorzuzaubern. Arg gitarrenlastig, mit Hetfield-Gesang ist diese Lied ganz klar auf die immer zahlreicher werdenden DT-Fans, die lieber Pogen, als komplexen Strukturen zuzuhören. Die sollen auch auf ihre Kosten kommen, das Lied bleibt simpel, sowohl in der groben, als auch feinen Struktur. Klar, technisch können alle Beteiligten glänzen, aber es geht doch nicht nur um Viruosität. Irgendwann kommt dann ein Instrumentalteil, der noch das Beste am Lied ist. Leicht tänzelnd erinnert er an ""In the Name of God"", hier macht es Spaß, zuzuhören. Mit dem Synthsolo wird er dann aber wieder dem Anfang entsprechend, also mit viel Double-Bass und allem, was dazu gehört. Das Hauptmotiv von ""The Dark Eternal Night"" ist zwar sehr DT-untypisch, macht aber Freude. Etwas vertrackt, leicht atonal, so lässt sich's hören. Leider wird wieder, genau wie im Lied zuvor, einer auf Metallica gemacht, es wird monoton, der Text eher albern. Die Struktur ist ein und dieselbe wie in ""Constant Motion"". Bald kommt ein vertrackter und ausgeflippter Instrumentalteil, der abermals um Welten besser ist als der Rest des Liedes, aber weniger ins Lied passt, als bei ""Constant Motion"". Die Thrash-Passage gegen Ende des Liedes gibt dem ganzen dann den Rest, es klingt etwas albern, als versuche man krampfhaft aber leider scheiternd, böse dreinzuschaun. Glücklicherweise warten einen als nächstes ruhigere Takte auf, mich persönlich stört das Zitat aus ""This Dying Soul"" nicht. Es wird sofort klar, dass es sich hier um Portnoys AA-Lied handelt, und anders als ""Forsaken"" ist es zwar ruhig, aber nicht Pop/Rockig. Im Gegenteil, mir gefällt's eigentlich, auch die Harmonien, die besonders gegen Ende großartig ausgebaut werden können begeistern. Wirklich anzukreiden ist dem ganzen bloß, dass es vielleicht ein paar Minuten weniger hätte vertragen können, oder auf der selben Länge etwas mehr Abwechslung hätte bieten können. Nach einem also eher soliden Lied bietet uns DT ein Muse-Verschnitt. Bis jetzt sucht mach vergeblich auf dem ganzen Album nach dem, was DT wirklich ausmacht, überall klingt es einfach nicht nach dem Quintett, das nun seit langer Zeit schon die Prog-Welt begeistert. ""Prophets of War"" scheitert hier nicht unbedingt daran, dass es nach Muse klingt. Die 50 Fans, die zu Portnoys Geburtstag eingeladen wurden, um ein paar Parolen einzusingen - pardon, einzuschreien, lassen das ganze etwas albern aussehen, da es einfach nicht überzeugt klingt. Ebenso Portnoy selbst, dessen Sprechgesang nie wirklich meine Lieblingszutat in DTs Werken war. ""Prophets of War"" scheitert nicht daran, dass es nach Muse klingt. Es scheitert daran, dass es nicht überzeugen kann, es klingt nicht ehrlich. Es klingt nicht inspiriert, es verändert sich nicht (weshalb es nur sechs minuten dauert) und hat nicht viel zu sagen. Eine Nummer zum einmal anhören, mehr nicht. An diesem Punkt des Albums bin ich etwas genervt von dem ganzen, und hoffe bei ""The Ministry of Lost Souls"" auf etwas wirklich überzeugendes. Leider helfen da die Plastik-Streicher aus Rudess' Synth, die eine ekelhafte Melodie herunterleiern, nicht wirklich. Lange bleibt es klischeehaft, anstrengend und kaum der Mühe wert, sich zu konzentrieren. Und was haben wir hier: Die selbe Struktur wie bei ""Constant Motion"" und ""The Dark Eternal Night"". Das Intermezzo passt noch weniger in den Rest als in ""The Dark Eternal Night"", es ist eigentlich ein verdammt gutes Intermezzo. Zwar beginnen mich Rudess' Klangexperimente, die er bereits in einigen Liedern zuvor ansetzte, zu nerven, aber dennoch bleibt der Instrumentalteil toll. Konsequent, mitreißend, und aufrichtig. ""The Ministry of Lost Souls"" zeigt glasklar, wo die Schwäche von Systematic Chaos bis jetzt liegt: es klingt zusammengebastelt und uninspieriert. Die Strukturen sind offensichtlich und hören schnell auf zu begeistern. Die Instrumentalpassagen, so toll sie sind, passen nicht in das restliche Lied, und so können sie die Lieder nur bedingt aufwerten. Kommen wir zum glücklicherweise letzten Lied. Und es ist ein wirklich tolles Lied. Mit einem stimmungsvoll-ruhigen Einstieg, bei dem man Myung endlich man über allem hört, baut es sich langsam auf. Endlich verzichtet man auf unnötiges technisches Muskelprotzen, auf unnötige verkrampft und gekünstelt klingende Härte, hier klingt alles ehrlich. Die Harmonien überzeugen, die Übergänge reißen mit, auch wenn Portnoy wieder seinen Sprechgesang auspackt. Leider kommt es wieder zu einem Instrumentalteil, der nicht ganz ins Lied passen will. Glücklicherweise ist hier der Kontrast nicht so extrem wie bei anderen Titeln, zumal das restliche Lied auch in Stimmungen variiert. Dafür ist das Intermezzo an sich nicht so gelungen wie z.B. bei ""The Ministry of Lost Souls"". Ein Grund dafür könnte die möglicherweise überzogene Länge sein. Wie dem auch sei, irgendwann geht auch ""In the Presence of Enemies pt. 2"" zuende, und wer hätte es gedacht? Die höchste Steigerung schafft es sogar, mir eine Gänsehaut zu verpassen, etwas, was nicht alle Tage passiert. Insgesamt ein Album, das für mich nur zweieinhalb Sterne verdient. Wieso: Die Strukturen sind schnell durchschaut und häufig die selben. Die Lieder klingen überwiegend zu zusammengebastelt, in sich unstimmig, verkrampft auf Härte und Technik gesetzt und einfach nicht aufrichtig. DT sucht man vergebens, zu viel klingt hier nach anderen Bands. Die wirklich überzeugenden Stellen sind viel zu selten, gehen im Mittelmaß unter und schaffen es nicht, die Gesamtqualität anzuheben. So wird die Hoffnung eines Fans enttäuscht. Wirkliche Fans der alten DT werden hier nicht auf ihre Kosten kommen, wer sich langsam vom gradlinigen Metal in komplexere Gefilde wagen will, der könnte hier den ersten Schritt tun. Es bleibt also bloß die Hoffnung, dass es in Zukunft besseres gibt."
2,ach hätte ich ihn doch in Erinnerung behalten wie er war. Diese CD ist ein trauriges Dokument.
5,"Diese neue CD (die ich im Radio vor dem Erscheinungstermin am 19. Januar gehört habe) der lettischen Mezzo mit dem dunklen Timbre ist absolute Spitze. Die übliche Kritik heutiger Spitzensänger trifft bei Elina Garanca nicht zu: Sie schafft es, technische Perfektion mit großer Durchdringung der Charaktere zu verbinden. Diese CD enthält Arien von Rossini bis Strauss, die sehr unterschiedliche Anforderungen stellen. So bekommt man einen guten Überblick über die gesanglichen Fähigkeiten Garancas."
1,"Die nicht mehr erhältliche Original-Aufnahme ""Rolf's Schulweg-Hitparade"" fand ich klasse. Dieses Remix ist allerdings purer Grauen...ein Möchtegern-Update mit schlechten, lieblosen Plastiksounds. Nicht auszuhalten!"
5,"Ich habe mich damals bei meinem USA Aufenthalt mit Alternative Rock infiziert und 3 Doors Down waren neben den Wallflowers, 3rd Eye Blind und The Verve Pipe meine Favoriten. Auch heute noch dies eines der wenigen Alben die man sich ohne 'Skip' anhört und von einer enthusiastischen Stimmung in die nächste getragen wird."
5,"... wer den Film gesehen hat, ...wer in den 80ern ähnliche Musik gehört hat, ...wer jetzt noch Lederkutte trägt, wer jetzt noch Lockenmähne und Lederleggins trägt, wer einfach ein gutes Heavy Metal Album haben möchten? Wenn Du alle Fragen mit Ja beantworten kannst, dann heißt es kaufen. Besonders der Maintheme geht einem nicht mehr so schnell aus dem Ohr... Kaufempfehlung!"
2,Wer nur die grossen Erfolge vn Margot Eskens haben möchte ist hier gut bedient. Wer mehr von Frau Eskens haben möchte ist allerdings bei den Produkten von Bear Family besser bedient.
5,"During the seventies, the Carpenters had considerable success in the pop charts on both sides of the Atlantic with their brand of pop music. Richard's expert arrangements and Karen's superb voice combined to create something special."
4,"Es sind gute Songs auf der CD ,aber auch unbekanntere ,also aus dem ganzen Repertoire des Künstlers.Es sollte jedoch trotz der guten Mischung , ein Schwerpunkt auf bekanntere Songs gelegt werden . Das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis ist sehr ausgewogen ,wegen der genannten Gründe habe ich auf eine 4-Sterne Bewertung zurückgegriffen ."
5,"Der Sommer 2003 - er war heiß! Das lag nicht nur an den hohen Temperaturen sondern auch daran, dass der beste Entertainer quer durch die Lande zog.  Ich selbst war auf einem der legendären Konzerte der Robbie Williams Tour Sommer 2003. Diese CD läßt die Erinnerung wieder hoch leben! Als wär man für 1 1/2 Stunden wieder bei der einzigartigen Show des Mannes der alle in seinen Bann zieht.  Sollte man die Showsensation verpasst haben, kann man sich hier einen kleinen Eindruck davon gewinnen, was Robbie Williams live bedeutet."
1,"So, da ist es nun, das neue Werk von Mr. Williams. Das erste Album ohne Co-Writer Chambers - ein riesiger Fehler, wie sich jetzt herausstellt!! Das Album ist von vorne bis hinten eintönig und ohne jeglichen Außreißer (Tripping mal ausgenommen). Escapology hatte ja einige davon - Come Undone / Hot Fudge / Me And My Monkey - und jetzt?"
2,"....in dieser Reihenfolge. Schöne Stimmen, romantische Lieder für kalte lange Winterabende, aber irgendwie wie aus einem Topf, Programme neu gemischt, arrangiert, ein weiteres hübsches Gesicht, aber nichts was bleiben wird. Ja man kann die CD gut hören, man kann auch einige Lieder mitsingen und bei Liebeskummer oder anderen Gefühlen sind sie sicher auch ganz hilfreich, aber sonst? Wenn mans Geld über hat, kaufen, wenn man überlegen muß, Radio hören, die Single läuft ja überall."
5,"Also ich finde die CD einfach fantastisch. Schon der Einstieg mit Smooth Criminal von Michael Jackson hat mich vom Hocker gehauen. ICh weiß, sein Konzert in Halle Gerry Weber lasse ich mir jetzt nicht mehr entgehen."
5,"Ich habe mir diese CD sofort an den Tag nach dem Erscheinungstermin gekauft und bin voll überzeugt. Wenn ich es könnte würde ich hierfür sieben Sterne vergeben. Es sind Top Lieder drauf wie Mutter, Links 2,3,4, Sonne, die schon alle einmal erfolgreich in den Charts waren. Aber auch die anderen Lieder wie Spieluhr, Nebel, Feuer frei!!! sind einfach top.... Ich sage nur eins &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kaufen!!!! &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;"
2,"Die neue Platte des irischen Bryan Adams aus Freiburg. Damit wäre eigentlich alles gesagt. Denn wenn man auf eingängige bis hymnische Rockmusik ohne große Ecken und Kanten steht, dann gehört Reamonn eindeutig zur engeren Wahl. Ob jetzt der erste Track ""Wish"" sich nach U2 anhört oder das Pathos bei ""Just Another Night"" nur so trieft ist eigentlich egal. Denn die Klientel der Hörer der ehrlichen Rockmusik kommen unter dem Strich allemal zum Zug. Zum gefahrlosen Midtempo-Headbangen."
2,"Also sorry: Mister Manilow hat schon besseres -nämlich eigenes- abgeliefert. Dieses ""cover me""- Album (Nena lässt grüssen...) ist äusserst schwach. Praktisch alle Songs wurden bereits besser, deutlich besser!, von den Original-Interpreten gesungen.  Wenn hier jemand von einem ""grossen Orchester"" schreibt, so höre ich das leider nicht....die Aufnahmen sind m.E. eher schwach instumentiert, so im Stil von Club-/Barmusik. Schade, dass Mister Manilow mit nunmehr 65 Jahren nicht erkennt, dass ""seine Zeit"" wohl eher vorbei ist.....da helfen weder Operationen, noch Cover-Stücke......"
1,"zugegeben bin ich generell skeptisch was cover-versionen angeht. aber dieses album (und leider auch alles andere was ich von den dynamics kenne) enttäuscht auf ganzer linie. wenn wenigstens die sound-ästhetik irgendwie besonders wäre, aber nein, flach und glatt klingt es, nichts wo man sagen könnte, das ist 'ihr' sound. (vergleicht man es z.b. mit den jungs von daptone records, die haben absolut ihren eigenen sound entwickelt) und dann eben noch die tatsache ein album voll mit covers zu machen. und nicht nur das, sondern auch ausschließlich mega-Hits zu covern, einfach schlecht. das ist zumindest meine meinung."
1,"Mensch ist das Lied klasse! Es errinert mich permanent daran, das ich mal wieder Daylight mit Sylvester Stallone ansehen muß!"
5,"Diese Platte (CD) ist der Anfang der neuen Musik! Oder hat jemand auf Kraftwerk vor 1981 getanzt? 1982 dachte ich mir...auf so was (Yazoo) habe ich ein Leben lang gewartet ..muss gestehen -war gerade 13 geworden;)) ALLE Songs sind Legende! Mittlerweile habe ich mir ungefähr 14 verschiedene Remixes von „Situation"" angeschafft. Dieser Song ist so gut, dass ihm nicht mal die schlechtesten Djays ruinieren können. Leider hat das Duett nicht zu lange gedauert. Was aus A.Moyet ohne V. Clarke geworden ist ...hört man aus ihrem neusten Album (Hometime)..eine gewaltige Stimme ohne Inspiration, verloren in depressiv-autistischer Stimmung;( Schade. Also, wer wissen will, wie das Klavier elektrisch wurde und der Pop gitarrenfrei positiv mutierte MUß sich diese CD kaufen!"
5,"Einzigartige und traumhafte Musiksphären mit wunderschönen Interluden! Und die gute Sarah Brightman singt (auch wenn auf dem Cover nur unter Pseudonym Hepsibah angegeben) auch wieder mit! Ihre Schwester hat dann auch gleich zwei Titel mitkomponiert, und die sind wirklich schön geworden. Mein Tip: SACRIFICE von Elton John, sehr gefühlvoll von GREGORIAN interpretiert in der Version, die Sinnead O'Connor auf dem Album ""Two Rooms"" sang. Diese CD ist ein MUSS, und die DVD wird sicher noch viel schöner!"
4,"Diese CD ist ein absolutes Muss für Manson Anhänger. Die Produktion war sicher nicht die beste ,trotzdem enthält sie einige der besten Songs die Manson je veröffentlicht hat, und natürlich einen der Top3 aller Manson Songs:""Dogma"". Wem es bei der Musik nur auf reine Tonqualität und nicht auf Inhalte und gute songs ankommt, sollte aber die Finger von der Scheibe lassen!"
4,"Wer die beiden Vorgängeralben hat, wird auf jeden Fall die Veränderungen feststellen. ""Does This Look Infected"" schlägt auf jeden Fall eine härtere Gangart an, wo leichte Metal-Züge nicht zu überhören sind. Wer sie vorher mochte, wird sie immer noch mögen. Dass es sich um die 4 Jungs aus Kanada handelt, ist bei keinem Song zu verkennen, trotzdem ist es(im Bezug zu den vorigen Alben) gewöhnungsbedürftiger. Ich möchte aber hiermit nicht den Eindruck erwecken, dass es keine geile Scheibe ist! Wer den Song ""Fat Lip"" so geil fand wie ich, wird sein Pendant in etwa mit ""Thanks for Nothing"" finden. Goons, es lohnt sich!"
5,"Leider ist es bei den Sugababes ja häufig so, dass man nicht mitbekommt, wenn es ein neues Album gibt. Als ich demnach eher zufällig auf dieses Album stieß musste ich es sofort haben (besitze nämlich auch alle anderen Alben) und bin sehr glücklich damit. Es gibt einige Lieder, die einem als Sugababes-Fan sofort im Gehör bleiben, bei anderen sollte man sich die Zeit nehmen sie öfter zu hören. Die Texte sind sehr vielschichtig, der Musikstil teils experimentell, teils typisch Sugababes. Insgesamt ein sehr gelungenes Album, das man wochenlang rauf und runterhören kann."
5,"Vom ersten bis zum letzten Song einfach super! Endlich mal wieder eine neue gefühlvolle Stimme mit guter Musik, eine willkommene Abwechslung zu den irgendwie immer gleichen Pop Cds, die keinen mehr vom Hocker hauen. Wer nur ""Bleeding Love"" hört, verpaßt die wirklich guten Songs wie z. B. ""Like A Bow"", ""Better In Time"" etc. Die ganze CD ist vom ersten bis zum letzten Lied einfach nur schön und lädt zum Träumen ein..."
1,"Dieter Bohlen hat es geschafft uns endlich zu überzeugen, daß er wirklich nicht nur schlecht singen kann, nein seine neue CD neben seinem doch so prickelnden Buch bringt uns wirklich zum grübeln!:Darf man sich sein Sammelsurium genialer DB Stücke überhaupt noch in ein CD Regal stellen? MT und DB Fans tun sicher aber allen anderen sei davon abgeraten dies zu tun!"
2,"Leider, leider ist der Gesang nicht erträglich. Umso ärgerlicher, da die Musik 1A ist. Aber Beckers Gesang macht die Platte für mich unhörbar. Kaum vorstellbar, wenn FAgen gesungen hätte...was hätte das für ein Meisterwerk werden können."
1,"...also Musik ist ja Geschmacksache...dieser Song ist allerdings gejaule, einzig gelungen ist der refrain..sorry aber die CD bietet hoffentlich mehr"
5,"Wenn der Name Zwingenberger fällt, wissen nicht nur Jazzfans in ganz Europa: Höchste Qualität vom Feinsten wird geboten! Pianist Axel und Schlagzeuger Torsten Zwingenberger, das Brüderpaar aus Hamburg, gehen mal eigene, mal gemeinsame Wege. Der Hörer freut sich, wenn die beiden, so wie hier, sich neben eigenen Projekten wieder einmal zu einer gemeinsame Aufnahme einfinden. Und dann wird gejamt, was das Zeug hält. Grundlage der tollen Improvisationen mit sehr guter Klangqualität bilden schöne Eigenkompositionen, in denen jeder auf seine Weise und mit seinem Instrument zeigt, was Musikalität ist. Der Hörer darf sich an einem bunten Strauss aus Swing, Boogie, und Shuffle und New Orleans-Jazz erfreuen.  Meine Lieblings-CD fürs Auto! Let's ""Zwing"" !"
5,"Ich bin ein alter Fan von Paul Kuhn, und ein Bewunderer von Bert Kaempfert und seiner Musik. Was für eine tolle Idee, diese beiden Swing-Größen musikalisch miteinander zu verbinden. Ganz besonders haben mir die Stücke gefallen, die von Greetje Kauffeld gesungen wurden. Was für eine Stimme..."
5,"Meine Kinder lieben diese CDs! Die Geschichten sind nicht zu lang und durch Musikunterbrechung nach einem Kapitel sehr angenehm zu hören. Ich kann alle CDs von Conni empfehlen, für jeden der Conni mag."
5,"Nachdem es nun schon etliche Best of-Alben der Jackson 5 bzw. der Jacksons gibt, haben sich einige schlaue Menschen endlich dazu entschieden, Songs aus der Motown-Ära mit den neueren Hits aus den 80er Jahren zu kombinieren. Und, voila, herausgekommen ist die beste und kompletteste Compilation der ""ersten schwarzen Boyband"", wobei die Jacksons so einen Titel nicht verdienen, da sie viel mehr waren als das. Diese Songs sind einfach nur WUNDERSCHÖN, ob zum Abrocken, Mitsingen oder einfach nur Zuhören;Klein-Michaels Stimme ist einfach grandios.Und je älter er wird(auf dem Album), desto besser und gefühlvoller die Stimme des (werdenden) King of Pop. Man sollte die Musik von den Jacksons, auch wenn sie von Michaels Weltkarriere ""überschattet"" wird, nicht unterschätzen, denn einiges ist wirklich genial.  Fazit: Eine durch und durch gelungene Mischung!! Für Fans von fantastischer black music!!!"
5,"Es war mal wieder soweit, Mick Jagger war in Berlin, hatte mit seinen Mannen zu Tee und Gebäck geladen und wollte dazu singen. Das ist nicht unbedingt neu, denn das hat er seit Gründung seiner Band, den Rolling Stones, in den sechziger Jahren schon öfter getan und 1965 zerlegten seine Fans dafür auch die Berliner Waldbühne. 17 Jahre später, 1982, war ich bei deren Wiedereröffnung auch durch die Rolling Stones dabei. Nun, 24 Jahre und sieben erlebte Konzerte später, setzte er wieder ein Konzert an, aber diesmal im Berliner Olympia-Stadion. Auch dort war ich schon öfter gewesen, aber die Zeit, der Euro und sehr gierige Veranstalter haben aus den 38 DM Obolus für Eintritt und guten Platz in der Waldbühne nun im Olympia-Stadion eine kostspielige Angelegenheit von über 100 Euro gemacht. Ein Geld, das ich logischerweise nicht hatte. Was ich hatte und habe, ist eine verständnisvolle Mutter, die weiß wie sie mir eine echte Freude machen kann und dafür auch schon mal happiges Geld bezahlt. 140 Euro für eine Karte sind definitiv recht happig und für mich absolut unerschwinglich, aber im Nachhinein betrachtet, hätte auch diese Ausgabe gelohnt. Nun kauft meine Mutter nicht einfach drauflos, sondern sucht sich immer die preiswerteste Variante. In meinem Fall, als Krüppel, bieten solche Großveranstaltungen ja immer irgendwelche Preisnachlässe oder die Begleitung darf umsonst mit rein, wenn eine Karte bezahlt ist. Also fast ein Schnäppchen, wenn nicht schon die eine Karte so sauteuer wäre und zudem noch an eine Bedingung geknüpft. Ich musste in meinem Rollstuhl zum Konzert und Bine als meine Begleitung mich also schieben, weil ich auf dem Untergrund mit einer Hand nicht recht vorwärts kam. So, wie ich im Urlaub in Ägypten neben oder wenigstens hinter ihr hergetigert bin, auch das eine neue Erfahrung für sie. Für mich ist der Rolli nur eine böse Erinnerung an sieben Monate Reha-Klinik, wo ich an das Ding gefesselt war. Aber für ein Konzert der Stones zieht man das schon mal durch, also nahm ich ihn mit zum Olympia-Stadion und lümmelte mich dort in meine Kutsche für diesen Abend. Pünktlich und zuverlässig, wie immer, trafen wir meine Bine vom S-Bahnhof Olympia-Stadion vor dem großen Eingang des Stadions. Wir mussten natürlich auf die andere Seite, aber es war noch früh genug, doch Bine kannte kein Halten und schob mich aufgeregt los. Oben angekommen, war der Platz erstmal sehr gut und die Sicht einfach großartig. Nur was ich da auf den Behindertenplätzen sah, dass stimmte mich erstmal nachdenklich, denn von Zwergenwuchs mit völliger Lähmung, über Mann mit ganz ohne Beine, einem Querschnittsgelähmten, der so kaputt war, dass er nicht einmal selbst schwitzen konnte, war da alles bei, was der gütige Christengott an bösartigen Krankheiten für seine gläubigen Schäfchen in seiner großen Güte und Langeweile so erschaffen hatte. Dagegen war ich mit meiner Halbseitenlähmung ja so beweglich und munter, wie eine Fruchtfliege auf dem Erdbeerkuchen. Ich hatte Ausblick auf eine recht ferne Bühne und den gut gefüllten Innenraum mit seinen gezählten 32 Dixi-Klos. Die Nummer mit dem Innenraum in einen Stadion hatte ich 1994 schon durch, als ich mit zwei Kollegen im alten Wembley Stadion doch tatsächlich bei den Rolling Stones war, aber das Konzert abgebrochen werden musst, weil das englische Wetter, der Regen, da zum Tragen kam und uns bis auf die Knochen einsaute. Damit war das Thema Innenraum bei mir auch endgültig gegessen und für mein nächstes Konzert 1995 von Guns n`Roses im Olympia-Stadion holte ich mir teure Karten für Plätze, wo kein Regen hinkam. Zurück in die Gegenwart von 2006 und ins Olympia-Stadion Berlin. Da ging es endlich um die Musik. Da aber Guns n`Roses als Vorgruppe abgesagt hatte, lärmte leider eine, mir völlig unbekannte Band und machte das, was alle Vorgruppen machen. Sie nervten, denn wir wollten alle die Stones. Die Zeit klebte und wurde mit der Umbaupause zu einer festen Masse. Dann endlich dröhnten die ersten Töne vom Smashhit ""Jumping Jack Flash"", die Bühnenshow begann mit großem Feuerwerk und großer Stoneszunge und das Stadion begann zu kochen. So ging es dann auch richtig los und das Ledergesicht Mick Jagger fegte mit seinen 62 über die Bühne, als wäre er 25 und hätte Hummeln im Hintern und sang dazu die Songs meiner Jugend, als würden sie morgen verboten werden. 44 Jahre Rock und 30 davon aus meinem Leben, das ging mir an die Nieren und tiefer, aber offenbar ging es nicht nur mir so. Dann bewies Mick Jagger Humor und kündigte ein Lied für eine Deutsche an und sang, keiner wird es ahnen, über ""Angie"". Der Kessel des Stadion kochte und die Leute flippten völlig aus. Es sollen zwar ""nur"" 60 000 von 75 000 Möglichen gewesen sein, wie ich später hörte, aber auch die geben schon mehr, als nur ein begeistertes Grüppchen. Zumal, wenn sie durch alle Generationen gingen und von 15 bis 65 da wieder alles vertreten war. Bine verstieg sich sogar dazu zu sagen, dass Konzert wäre besser als Sex. Wundern täte mich das nicht, denn sie hat ja ihren Sex mit mir und da kann sie sich ja nur verbessern. Wer aber noch immer sagt, die Stones sind nur blöde, war noch nie bei einem ihrer Konzerte, hat absolut keine Ahnung von guter Musik, ist einfach nur ein völliger Ignorant oder alles zusammen!"
5,"Die europäischen Fans des Ausnahmebassisten TM Stevens mussten lange warten... doch es hat sich mehr als gelohnt: Energiegeladen, druckvoll und clever arrangiert bohrt sich Shocka Zooloo von den Gehörgängen direkt in den Bauch. T.M. selbst bezeichnet seinen Sound als ""Boom Funk"" oder auch ""Heavy Metal Funk"" und landet damit einen Volltreffer. Harte Gitarrenriffs, treibende Beats, packende Refrains und nicht zuletzt die unverwechselbaren funkigen Bass-Grooves machen Shocka Zooloo zu einem Leckerbissen nicht nur für Bassisten. Besonders empfehlenswert: Song Nr. 8 ""Spank"" und Nr. 9 ""Thumb"" Tipp am Rande: Auf keinen Fall die anstehende Tournee verpassen."
5,"kann mich der vorherigen rezension voll und ganz anschliessen. hab das 2 stück im radio gehört und gleich die ganze cd gekauft. eine wirklich lohnenswerte sache. jedes stück ist einfach nur genial. wer arabische musik mag, sollte sich unbedingt dieses juwel anschaffen. speziell die percussion vormochte mich zu bezaubern, aber auch der rest ist ein wahrer ohrenschmaus. die teils indischen und spanischen elemente harmonieren perfekt mit dem arabischen.  wenn ich dieses album mit einem kurzen wort beschreiben müsste, dann währe dies: WOW wer bei dem album nicht zugreift ist selber schuld."
4,"Erstklassiges Album was Nikki Sixx hier abliefert. Top Produktion, erstklassiger Sound und 1a Lieder. 1 Stern abzug, weil aufgrund der anhaltenden traurigkeit auf dem Album, es sehr anstrengend ist, es am Stück zu hören. Auf 2 mal verteilen, dann ist das Okay. Da es sich ja um ein vertontes Tagebuch handelt, frag ich mich allerdings, ob Mr. Sixx überhaupt mal was zu lachen hatte. Zum Sänger: ausgezeichnete Wahl, keinerlei Ähnlichkeit zu Vince Neil (was ja gut ist, sonst wärs ja n MC Album). Die Songs sind auch etwas poppiger vom Sound her, was aber ein Pluspunkt ist, da es einfach passt.  So nun freuen wir uns noch aufs neue MC Album, Single ""Saints of los Angeles"" lässt ja auf einige s hoffen."
1,"Wie mehrfach schon mehrfach bemerkt, werden hier viele Dinge gemischt. Mag sein, dass es Menschen gibt, die diese ""von jedem ein bißchen-Mache"" mögen, für mein Empfinden wirkt doch vieles einfach aneinandergereiht und daher ohne wirkliche innere Sapnnung."
5,"das is noch Musik. Hab beide Sendungen vom ZDF 50 Jahre Rock gesehen und diese Allstar Band mit Ian Anderson, Jon Lord und vielen anderen hat mir sehr gut gefallen. Das is noch Musik, wie sie heute leider nich mehr gemacht wird. Da müssen mal wieder ""Alte Recken"" kommen und es dem Nachwuchs zeigen, wie gute Musik gemacht wird."
5,"Als Rush etwa ab ihrem dritten Album begannen, sich vom Led Zepellin-Hardrock abzuwenden und ihren eigenen Stil zu kreieren, wurden sie immer besser. 1981 toppten sie mit diesem Album dann alles, was sie bis dahin aufgenommen hatten. Sozusagen der Hoehepunkt in ihrer heute nun mehr als dreissigjaehrigen Karriere. Alles was bei vorherigen Platten an Schwaechen auftauchte, wurde hier restlos ausgemerzt, heraus kam das perfekte Rush-Album: 'Moving Pictures'.  Es gibt viele Alben, bei denen auch nach mehrmaligem Hoeren nichts haengen bleibt; ganz anders dieses hier. Auf 'Moving Pictures' hat jeder Song seine markante Eigenschaft und Charakteristik. Dabei wirkt das ganze Album trotzdem wie aus einem Guss, da es vom Sound her eine Einheit bildet. Schon Ende der Siebziger haben Rush durch Hinzunahme des Synthesizers ihren Sound erweitert, hier gehen sie eine Stufe weiter, indem sie ihre Musik weniger sperrig konstruieren, und diese sogar mit einem ordentlichen Schuss Pop aufwerten. Das soll jetzt keineswegs den beinharten Prog-Hoerer erschrecken, viele Stuecke haben komplexe Strukturen, insbesondere das Instrumental 'YYZ', welches sonst wohl seinesgleichen sucht. 'Movin Pictures' bietet wirklich tolle Musik auf dauerhaft hohem Niveau.  Schon der Opener hat - wie jedes Stueck auf diesem Album - seine eigenen Charme. Es ist ein eher langsames aber dennoch rockiges Stueck mit nun wirklich gut gewordenem Gesang von Geddy Lee, und schoenen Synthesizer-Melodien. Zu Beginn des zweiten Songs wird es dann noch ruhiger, aber dann besticht dieser doch mit gelungenen Gitarrenriffs. Nun folgt dass bereits erwaente 'YYZ'. Typisch proggig und vertracktet beginnt der Song, ehe ein Riff auf der Gitarre die Rolle uebernimmt, dabei aber auch mit interessanten Basslauefen im Hintergrund! Die Gitarrenriffs beginnen zu varieren, sie werden mal schneller mal langsamer. Die Gitarre spielt immer etwas vor, der Bass spielt etwas zeitversetzt dazu, 'antwortet' somit auf die Gitarre. Dannach wieder Rhytmuswechsel, und es folgt ein Part mit furiosem Gitarrensolo, dann setzten die Synthesizer ein, ehe Gitarre und Bass wieder zu frickeln beginnen, bis der Song sich in einem typischen Rock-Ende aufloest.  Danach kommt fuer mich der Hit dieses Albums. Tatsaechlich poppig, aber wirklich sehr geil! 'Limelight', der genau den gleiche Titel traegt wie der 5 Jahre spater erschienene Song des Alan Parsons Project's. Tatsaechlich wueder ich die Musik auf 'Moving Pictures' bezeichnen, als wuederen Camel und das Alan Parsons Project verschmelzen, verstaerkt Gitarren einsetzen als sie es selber tun und zudem am Haertegrad schrauben. Aber vielleicht sage ich das nur, weil Camel und APP fuer mich goetliche Musik machen, eben so wie Rush auf diesem Album hier. Zurueck zu 'Limelight', denn hier singt Greddy Lee eine wirklich wunderbare Melodie, das haette wirklich ein Hit in den 80ern werden koennen! Das Stueck laesst bei mir derartige Emotionen hochschiessen, sodass ich ihn nie vermissen moechte. Irgedwie total der Lebensgefuehl-Song! Mit 'The Camera Eye' folgt ein Longtrack, der rein Instrumental und mit viel Synthieeinsatz beginnt, um dann zu variieren bevor der Gesang einsetzt und sich halt ein langer Song mit einer kleinen prise Atmosphaere. Lee's Leistung am Mikrophon ist auch hier wiedermal zu loben. Nicht zu fassen, hatte er doch auf Alben wie '2112' eine derartige Shouterstimme. Zwar gibt es weitaus besere Saenger als Lee, aber jedenfalls passt hier seine Stimme einfach wunderbar zum Text und zu dieser metalligen, von der Gitarre dominierten Musik.  Das folgende 'Witch Hunt' ueberrascht dann mit seinem mysterioesen Intro. Das klingt dann auf einmal nach einer Beschwoerung oder sogar nach einem Horror-Film. Nach dem Intro entwickelt sich ein schleppender Rock/Progmetal-Song, wieder mit schoenem Synthesizer-Einsatz.  Auf dem abschliessenden 'Vital Signs' gefallen mir insbesondere die wabernden Synthesizer und wieder einmal der Gesang. Noch ein Song, der 80er-Feeling aufkommen laesst.  So ein Album habe ich mir irgendwie schon immer gewuenscht!"
1,"Alexander ist Deutschland's Superstar. Tja, RTL und die Millionen RTL Dauergucker haben es so gewollt. Nun ja, man hätte was draus machen können. Siehe UK: Will Young wurde von vielen gefeiert als er sein 2. Album releaste. Eigener Stil gefunden. USA: Kelly Clarkson hat eine Bombast Stimme"
4,"Timbaland und die Neptunes, eine Karriere bei der beliebtesten Boygroup N*Sync, eine karrierefördernde Affäre mit Barbie Spears und herauskommt: Ein Album, das schon die magische drei Millionen Grenze zu überschreiten droht, ein Hit nach dem anderen und zahlreiche Preise! Das Album ist absolut spitze, es gibt kein schlechtes Lied. Muss ja auch so sein, wenn Top-Produzenten am Werk waren. Die Highlights schlechthin sind die von Timbo produzierten Songs ""Cry Me A River"" und ""(And She Said) Take Me Now"" (übelst geiler Beat)!. Weitere Gute Lieder sind ""Like I Love You"" (typischer, Neptunes Beat, gefeatured wird Clipse), der opener Senorita (mein Sommerhit) und das, für die Neptunes typische ""Rock your Body"" (und das geilste is ja wohl die Beatbox-Einlage). JT`s Stimme ist absolut nicht schlecht, auch wenn er sich manchmal so anhört, als würde man ihm hinten reinkneifen...;-) Aber schlecht ist absolut kein Song Sein Weg weg vom Bubble-Gum-Pop ist absolut geglückt. Absolut verdiente 4 Sterne!"
5,"Ja, es war nicht leicht für sie eine Familie zu ernähren, Hochzeitspläne zu schmieden und gleichzeitig ein Album aufzunehmen. Aber es ist ihr SEHR gut gelungen.  Mir gefält das Album SEHR gut. es hat abwechslungsreiche Titel drauf darunter Balladen und auch etwas ""fetzigere"" Songs."
5,"Da ich die Alben »Enrique« und »Escape« von Ihm habe, habe ich mich kurz entschlossen das Album zu besorgen was auch kein Fehlgriff war, tolle Musik so wie man es von Ihm gewohnt ist.Das Album wird nach paar mal abspielen wirklich immer besser, meine absoluten Favoriten sind »Ring My Bells«»Little Girl«  Ich mag die Musik nicht weil er ein gutaussehender Typ ist,  sondern weil er wirklich aus dem Schatten seines Vaters längst hinaus getreten ist und was von Musik versteht. Toller Sound"
2,"Nachdem ich vom Titel ""Addicted"" restlos begeistert war, dachte ich, so ein Supertitel, da kann die CD ja nur super sein... ich war entäuscht. Es hört sich alles ziemlich gleich an, ziemlich langweilig und einfallslos, hätte ich bloß vorher reingehört... Mit einer Maxi-CD mit o.g. Titel wäre ich besser bedient gewesen."
1,"Es gibt ja viele Mysterien im Music-Biz. Immer wieder fragt man sich, wie diverse Lieder Erfolg haben können und wie die ""Künstler"" damit auch noch steinreich werden. So ist beispielsweise Jan Delay einer der erfolgreichsten deutschen Musiker, obwohl seine Stimme nicht mal für die erste Castingrunde bei DSDS ausreichen würde. Und so hat es Rihanna auch auf die 1 geschafft, obwohl dieses ""Lied"" sowohl in textlicher als auch musikalischer Hinsicht unterstes Niveau darstellt. Jay-Z's Stimme ist nicht mehr als Genöhle, und das immer wiederkehrende ""ella ella ella e e e"" ist noch weniger erträglich als eine Feuerwehrsirene und ein Presslufthammer gleichzeitig. Ich kenne eigentlich niemanden, dem dieses Machwerk gefällt, trotzdem läuft es im Radio rauf und runter. Rihanna hat normalerweise eine recht schöne Stimme, wieso aber lässt sie sich derart erbärmliche und dämliche Kost unterschieben? Naja, der Music-Biz steckt ja voller Mysterien ..."
1,"Solche Musik und sloche Bands gehören schlichtweg verboten. Bei einem solchen Album kann man sich als Freund anständiger Musik jegliche Sachlichkeit sparen! Eine Coverversion jagt die andere und alle prügeln sich um die Krone des schlechtesten Tracks... Wie kann ein Mensch mit funktionierenden Gehörsinn und einem halbwegs vorhandenen Gehirn sich nur so etwas anhören? Eine dreiviertel Stunde lang wird dir der 4/4 Takt um die Ohren gehauen, den man auch eine dreiviertel Stunde lang mitklatschen kann, ohne, dass man irgendwie das Tempo ändern , oder sich auf anderweitige störende Abwechslung im Programm vorbereiten muss. Dann ist da noch dieses Blonde Mädel, das wahrscheinlich irgendwie richtig geil rüberkommen soll, was aber nicht ganz zieht und somit auch nichts übrig bleibt, was über ihr fehlendes Talent auch nur einen Ton zu treffen hinwegtäuschen könnte. Wäre dieser ganze Mist jetzt von dieser ""Band"" selbst erschaffen, dann könnte man ihnen wenigstens einen Funken Kreativität zusprechen, doch leider handelt es sich um eine Handvoll langweilige Cover Versionen... da bleibt nur noch einwas zu sagen:  DURCHGEFALLEN, TOTALER MÜLL, TOTALE VOLKSVERBLÖDUNG!"
5,Für mich ist sie einfach die beste Trance Kompilation der Galaxis. Future Trance schafft es meistens mich zu überzeugen und schafft es auch diesmal. Ich bin schon lange ein FT Fan und habe es nicht bereut. Also für FT Fan's ein muss. Future Trance 4ever!!! Gruss Daine.
1,"Wenn man diesen Song das erste mal hört könnte man denken wow da haben Scooter ja einen tollen Refrain geschrieben.  Die Wahrheit ist jedoch daß dieser nur von einem kleinen, unbekannten Jumpstyle Projekt 1:1 kopiert wurde. Der Name dieses Projektes lautet Felix Project, der Titel was für ein Zufall lautet Lonely.  Dieser Song wurde gerade mal Mitte 2007 veröffentlich. Scooter kopieren das Lied 2007 für ihr Album Jumping All Over The World welches Ende 2007 veröffentlicht wurde und veröffentlichen es nun 2008 in überarbeiteter Version als Single. Alleine schon diese Tatsache ist sehr traurig, ehrlich gesagt kenne ich keine andere Band die es nötig hat Songs aus dem gleichen Jahr zu covern und hinterher auch noch so zu tun als ob sie diesen Song selbst erfunden hätte. Denn mit Aussagen über die Herkunft ihrer Songs halten sich Scooter in der Öffentlichkeit ja bekanntlich immer sehr zurück. Somit entsteht bei der Masse mal wieder der Eindruck Scooter hätten mal wieder eine geniale Songidee erfunden, denn wer kennt schon dieses kleine, unscheinbare Jumpstyle Projekt mit dem Namen Felix Project. Scooter werden sich nach Erfolg trauriger Weise mal wieder als große Songerfinder und Götter der Dancemusik feiern lassen. Das die ganze Idee aber in Wirklichkeit mal wieder nur von anderen geklaut und kopiert wurde wird in der Öffentlichkeit verschwiegen.  Übrigens wurde nicht nur der Refrain von einem anderen Song kopiert, große Teile der Trance Sequencen sind auch nicht auf Scooter Boden gewachsen, sondern wurden von dem Trance Klassiker Vincent de Moor- Fly Away abgekupfert. Fazit: Wäre ein guter Song, wenn er von Scooter auf ehrliche Weise erfunden und produziert worden wäre. Aber auf diese Art und Weise einfach nur billig und einfallslos. Mal wieder leider nur ein pures Kommerzprodukt ohne musikalischer Eigenleistung."
2,"Nun wissen wir ja alle, dass R'n B seit einigen Jahren nicht mehr R'n B ist, sondern sich mittlerweile zum Bubblegum-Pop der 2000er gemausert hat. Keine gute Entwicklung, aber so ist das halt, Musikgenres verändern sich, mal steht das eine, mal das andere oben an der Spitze ... Aktuell allerdings kann man an sogenannter Black Music nichts Schwarzes mehr finden, außer eben in Hinsicht auf die Optik der ""Künstler"". Jetzt gibt es ein paar wenige Jungs und Mädels, die noch aus der Mitte der 90er stammen und quasi die goldene Ära des modernen R'n B mitgezeichnet haben: Brandy, Monica udn wie sie alle heißen. Unter anderem auch die drei Damen von Destiny's Child. Ist Beyoncé mittlerweile vollkommen größenwahnsinnig geworden und nur noch auf einen Oscar aus, statt mit ihrer Stimme und ihrem Soul zu punkten, dachte man zumindest immer, man könne sich wenigstens auf Kelly Rowland verlassen; die hat nämlich eine genauso einzigartige, tolle Stimme, genauso einen starken persönlichen Bezug zu echter Soulmusik und ist längst nicht so extrem Charts-abhängig wie ihre Kollegin. Aber nein, auch Kelly geht bei Soloalbum Nummer Zwei auf Nummer sicher und bedient konsequent die Masse - udn ""die Masse"" ist nicht das einstige Publikum, das schon Destiny's Child mochte oder zu einer Zeit R'n B gehört hat, als der große Rest auf Britney-Pop oder Backstreet Boys stand - die Masse scheint jetzt aus Teenagern definiert zu sein, Kinder, die Musik nur mögen, wenn sie schnell verdaulich, einfach gestrickt und möglichst ohne Aussage daherkommt; Tracks also, die sich so wunderbar einfach auf dem mp3-Player an der Bushaltestelle hören lassen. Das ist Musik, die nicht berührt, es tut mir leid. Clubben ist ja schön und gut, aber auch das kann man tatsächlich mit spannenden Beats und individuellen Soundstrecken - man mag es kaum glauben, ist aber so. Haben uns in der Vergangenheit dann doch ein paar Künstler gezeigt, und ja, auch kommerzielle Künstler. Ich bin sehr, sehr (!) enttäuscht von Kelly. Wer wissen will, was Miss Rowland eigentlich drauf hat, udn was sie, ihre Stimme und ihren Bezug zur Musik ausmacht, der kaufe sich lieber ""Simply deep"", ihr Solodebür von 2003. Das kann man zwar weniger in einer Kinderdisco hören, da es eher von Ruhe und Nachdenklichkeit durchzogen ist, dafür stimmen da aber die Arrangements. Diese Scheibe ist leider lediglich Einheitsbrei - udn noch nicht einmal guter. Wäre Kellys Stimme nicht, würden einen die Tracks wirklich vollkommen kalt lassen. Tun sie zum Großteil aber ohnehin. Emfehlen kann ich höchstens ""Work"". ""The show"", ""Love"" und ""Better without you"" sind ebenfalls gute Songs, vor allem letzterer zeigt, was Kelly Rowland dann doch kann - aber alles in allem ist das hier ein fast schon peinlich auf Chart- und Klingeltonerfolge ausgerichtetes, gänzlich uninspiriertes Dance-Album und einer Kelly Rowland schlicht und ergreifend einfach nicht würdig. Aber so ist nunmal das Geschäft ..."
5,"Tolle Aktion von WDR 2 ein Ranking der besten Alben aller Zeiten zu erstellen. Ich habe wirklich am Radiogerät geklebt und habe mich immer gefragt: ""was kommt als nächstes"". Dementsprechend war auch mein Freude riesig als ich die wunderbare ""WDR 200"" Compilation in den Händen halten konnte. Wirklich nur grossartige Tracks drauf. Die Tatsache, dass die Gewinner Pink Floyd nicht vertreten sind, ist eigentlich kein Problem für mich. Das Gewinner Album ""Wish You Were Here"" kann man nicht auseinander nehmen und nur ein Track daraus featuren. DAS GEHT NICHT! Dieses Album muss man GANZ besitzen, hören und geniessen. Ist halt das beste Album aller Zeiten! Wahrscheinlich wurde es aus dem Grund nicht auf die Compilation genommen. Kleiner Tip: Amazon hat immer Spitzen-Preise bei dem ""Wish You..."" Album. Ein zusätzlicher Klick zum Kauf dieses ALbums lohnt sich also absolut. Müsste jeder gescheite Musik-Fan im Schrank stehen haben. Euer Charles"
5,"wie eine Offenbahrung legt sich der Klangteppich dieser unglaublichen CD mir zu Füssen und ich versinke darin als hilflos ausgelieferter Hörer zwischen gefühlvollen Klängen von Instrumenten, aus denen man die Ausdruckskraft eines jeden Tones einzeln bis zur letzten Sekunde ausschöpft. Wer jetzt aber schmalzige Baladen erwartet hat sich geirrt, denn in den Songs von Madrugada hat sich eine stille agressive Emotion mit Sehnsucht gepaart was nicht zuletzt der wahnsinnigen Stimme des Sängers zu verdanken ist. Sicher kommen einem sofort Erinnerungen an hauptsächlich Chris Isaak und Nick Cave, aber man hat nie das Gefühl es mit einer Kopie zu tun zu haben sondern mit der Vervollkommnung der Stile die Isaak und Cave geprägt haben. Diese CD ist ein Klassiker bei dem kein Entrinnen mehr möglich scheint."
1,"über die Musik kann man sich streiten, für mich ist es zu viel Bumbum. Den Text finde ich verwerflich und schlicht nicht gesellschaftskonform. Solches Zeuge sollte meiner Meinung nach verboten sein. Ich finde es schlimm, unsere Jugendlichen mit solchem unreflektierten, aggressiven ""Worteherausschleudern"" zu überschwemmen. Sie hören meist nur der Musik zu und vergessen dabei, dass die Botschaft des Textes ebenso wichtig ist."
1,"Deutschlands liebste Techno-Proleten rund um Wasserstoffblondel H. P. Baxxter (mit bürgerlichem Namen Hans Peter Geerdes) haben es wieder getan. Mit dem bislang 13. Album Jumping all over the world seit der Gründung 1993 huldigen sie jedoch nicht nur offensichtlich und exzessiv dem weit verbreiteten Tanz- und Musikstil des Jumpstyle, sondern veröffentlichen erstmals seit 1996 (Our happy hardcore (März) und Wicked (Oktober)) eine zweite Platte in nur einem Jahr. Kommerziell hat sich die Sache auf jeden Fall schon ausgezahlt, denn die Vorab-Single The question is what is the question schoss in Deutschland in die Top 10 und belegte in Österreich einen beachtlichen zweiten Platz. Das letzte Mal mischten Scooter, was die Charts betrifft, mit der Single Maria (I like it loud!) und dem dazugehörigem Album The stadium techno experience (03/2003) in denselben Größenordnungen ganz vorne mit. Wieso sich andere Workaholics in der Musik (wie z.B. Ryan Adams oder Ani DiFranco) mit der Veröffentlichungspolitik des Techno-Acts jedoch trotzdem nicht messen müssen, liegt jedes Jahr auf der Hand. Die derzeit aus dem Chicks Terminator, Rick J. Jordan (mit bürgerlichem Namen Hendrik Stadler) und Michael Simon bestehende Kombo verwurstet jedes Jahr aufs Neue die Melodien und Refrains aus Klassikern, Evergreens und Traditionals und bindet diese mehr schlecht als recht in ihren Techno/Trance/Dance-Kontext ein, was auch auf Jumping all over the world seine x-te, ewig gleich klingende Fortsetzung findet. Zwar muss man dem deutschen Act attestieren, dass einige Tracks als Partyfutter durchaus gute Laune machen, allerdings wirken die Songs im Gegensatz zum Vorgängerwerk The ultimate aural orgasm (02/2007) wesentlich ermüdender und schlaffer. Da hilft auch der erneut einsetzende Hardcore-Einfluss (besonders stark in Jumping all over the world (der Refrain ist abgekupfert von Sailors A glass of champagne) und The hardcore massive hörbar) nichts, denn mehr als ungläubiges Kopfschütteln ernten Scooter mit diesen Lächerlichkeiten nicht. Dann schon eher das auf der Melodie von Mouth &amp; MacNeals How do you do basierende The question is what is the question oder der instrumentale Floorfiller Lighten up the sky. Im Gegensatz zu anderen vorangegangenen Alben der Techno-Kombo können die von hochphilosophischer Baxxter-Lyrik verschonten Tracks wie Cambodia (im Original von Kim Wilde), Whistling Dave (wer schon einmal Tetris gespielt hat, kann gleich weiterschalten) oder The hardcore massive leider nicht überzeugen, da die Ideen entweder bereits tausendmal vorher verwendet wurden oder auf notwendige Abwechslung verzichtet wurde. Der Rest bedient sich strikt bei der Formel Aus alt mach neu und ist nicht einmal ein Schulterzucken wert. Als da hätten wir Enola gay, basierend auf OMDs gleichnamigem Klassiker, Neverending story, das vor allem vielen Fans des Films sauer aufstoßen wird und die neue Single And no matches, die sich zwar an Emilias Nummer 1-Hit Big big world aus dem Jahre 1998 anlehnt, vom Prinzip her aber eine 1:1 Kopie von The question is what is the question ist. Völlig aus dem Rahmen fällt Marian, welches ursprünglich auf dem Debütalbum First and last and always (03/1985) der Sisters Of Mercy enthalten war und von H.P. mit tiefer Stimme und deepen Electro House-Rhythmus denselben Gothic-Touch vermitteln soll, aber einfach nicht in den Gesamtkontext passen will und dadurch zu einer peinlichen Lachnummer verkommt. Alles in allem bestätigt Jumping all over the world in keinster Weise den (für einen Scooter-Output doch recht) positiven Gesamteindruck vom Vorgängeralbum und lässt den ehrenwerten Rezensenten in furchtvoller Erwartung auf die Ergüsse, die von Deutschlands Vorzeigeblondine Baxxter noch kommen mögen, zurück."
4,"... klingt dieses Album nach ausnahmslos zündendem Material. Seit dem letzten Album hat sich nämlich einiges getan, wovon sich der Schlagzeugerwechsel am meisten auf den Stil der Band ausgewirkt hat. Die songs klingen jetzt nicht mehr so ins kleinste Detail durchgegangen, sondern eher glatt und im Schnitt auch schon beim ersten Hören recht eingängig. Verzichtet wird auf ein oder mehrere Solos nur in einem Song komplett, und zwar ""The Weak Willed"". Alles nichts neues, denkt man, wenn man davon hört, dass hier geshoutet wird in den Strophen und gesungen im Refrain. Aber in 3 der Songs wird stark auf einen gemischt geshoutet und gesungenen Refrain gesetzt, wodurch ganz neue Akzente herauskommen. Auch sonst hat dieses Album nicht sonderlich viel mit dem restlichen Metalcore mehr am Hut, denn z.B. auch Breakdowns finden sich nur in vier der 11 Stücke. Das tempo des gesamten Albums ist dabei darauf ausgesetzt ohne Stampf-Uffta schnell zu sein, und somit gleichzeitig zu grooven, so dass die konstruierten Tempoveränderungen größtenteils ausbleiben. Wenn die Band sich jetzt nóch etwas mehr aufeinander einlässt und man mehr auf die Stärken der Musiker und etwas weniger auf de Hitverdächtigkeit der Songs bezogen vorgeht, ist das nächste Album wohl ein Unschlagbares. 4 von 5 für das Niveau dieser Band, aber 5 von 5 im Vergleich zu dem größten Teil des Rests im Metalcore-Topf."
2,"Okay, besser als Pop Musik ist die CD allemal. Kannte bisher nur zwei Titel von Chimaira, nämlich ""Down Again"" und ""Sp Lit"". Diese kannte ich wiederum von der ""Roadrunner Records Roadrage"" DVD. Gefallen haben mir beide, wegen eingänglicher Melodien und knüppelharten Beats. Also bestellte ich mir ""Pass Out Of Existence"" und war sehr enttäuscht. Die Tracks sind an sich (je nach Geschmack) ganz okay, aber reichen nicht annähernd an meine favourite Band ""Fear Factory"" heran. Die Texte sind immer sehr kurz und dann kommt ein mehrminutiges Instrumental mit schwachsinnigem Gegröhle und überdrehten Riffs. Der letzte Track ""Jade"" geht ungefähr 15min. und endet in irgendeinem (wirklich) billigen Elektro-Beat. Das was mir am wenigsten an dieser CD gefällt ist die Tatsache das sich die Texte nur um Tod und Mißhandlung drehen. Das muß ich mir echt nicht geben. Versteht mich nicht falsch, diese Themen sollten wirklich öfter behandelt werden, aber doch nicht über ein ganzes Album hinweg. Fazit: Unbedingt vorher reinhören ansonsten Finger Weg!"
2,"Was sich die Amorphisten bei der Aufnahme dieser CD gedacht haben würde mich brennend interessieren. Dass das Tales From the Thousend Lakes noch ein Death Metal Album und die neueste CD fast schon eine Pop Platte ist, muss man der Band hoch anrechnen. Welche Gruppe schafft schon so einen Wandel. Aber dass man solche LANGWEILER aufnimmt, soll erst recht was heissen. Bereits auf dem letzten Album habe ich solche Ohrwürmer wie das To Fathers Cabin oder Kracher wie von der Isthmus CD vermisst. Damit meine ich aber weiss-gott-nicht, dass die Band den ""Weg des Erwachsenwerdens"" verlassen sollte. Das Grunzen können andere besser und Saxophon oder Hammond-Orgel sind fetzige Instrumente."
5,"Ich habe alle Alben der Band und bin schon seit einiger Zeit ein begeisterter Hörer der Band. Ich finde das Album ""Count Yout Blessings"" ist das beste Album von Bring Me The Horizon."
4,"Eigentlich ist es einer band gegenüber unfair ihr neuestes material immer mit den vorgänger(n) zu vergleichen und doch orientieren sich die meisten caliban hörer an der „shadow heart"". Zugegeben wurde die neueste scheibe ziemlich roadrunner tauglich gemacht und produziert und ob die gesangsparts von den kse-brüdern geklaut wurde oder nicht ist doch nicht wirklich von bedeutung. Es ist schön wieder brachiale caliban zu hören, wobei eben die umstrittenen gesangsparts für meinen geschmack ein wenig überhand genommen haben."
5,"Sind Sie schon mal so richtig enttäuscht worden? Hat Sie schon mal jemand 14 Monate an der Nase herumgeführt? Fühlen Sie sich wie eine Närrin, dumm, naiv und wie ein Stück Dreck? Hören Sie Cher, da geht es Ihnen gleich besser! Denn ihr ging es auch nicht viel anders und sie weiß wovon sie singt. Neben den Hits ""Believe"", ""Strong Enough"" und ""All or Nothing"" gefällt mir sehr gut ""Takin' back my heart"": I'm all through with lovin' you Wasting my precious time on you Gonna walk away, walk out, Kiss this love goodbye ... Don't belong to you no more What did I ever see in you How could I be so blind a fool. ""Taxi, Taxi"" und ""Love is the groove"" sind auch schön, eigentlich fällt nur ""We all sleep alone"" qualitätsmäßig stark ab. Cher hat 1998 mit diesem Album ein sagenhaftes Comeback gelandet, mit ""Believe"" wochenlang auf Platz 1 der Charts ... Ein sehr gutes Album mit vielen fetzigen Songs zum Tanzen, aber auch zum Hinhören. Toll!"
5,"Die Stimme Jim Steinmans kann meines Erachtens mit der Stimme von Meatloaf nicht nur bestens mithalten - sie ist auch gehaltvoller. Bad for Good ist eine der besten Alben, die ich je gehört habe. Ich kenne es seit  Erscheinungsdatum in den frühen 80ern."
5,"On The Radio is a brilliant collection of Donna Summer's greatest hits from the middle to the late 1970s. As such it's a mix of classic dance tracks and beautiful ballads. Amongst the former, my favourites include the much re-released and remixed I Feel Love - the hypnotic pioneering synth-pop masterpiece, plus the breathtaking MacArthur Park, the rock-influenced Hot Stuff and Bad Girls plus Sunset People and Our Love from the Bad Girls album. Her early albums are also well represented with the tracks Love To Love You Baby, Try Me and I Remember Yesterday, one of her best loved ballads. The album concludes with No More Tears, her powerful duet with Barbra Streisand, and an extended version of On The Radio. It's a perfect showcase of Donna's versatility and contains all the chart hits from that era, but is by no means the full story on Donna Summer, who continued to make music throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Good music ages well, and this collection is proof."
2,"Der sympathischte und gleichzeitig unmusikalischste Beatle mischt noch immer im Musikbusiness mit. Ansonsten wäre ihm wahrscheinlich langweilig. Zum diesjährigen Event Kulturhauptstadt Europa Liverpool gibt es 12 neue Songs, die von Produzent Dave Stewart mit allen Ingredenzien vergangener Beatles-Tage versehen wurden - was aber auch nicht half. Der Opener, gleichzeitig auch Titelstück ""Liverpool 8"" ist eine nette Hommage an einen, der auszog, ein Beatle zu werden - inclusive Simplerefrain und eingespielter Jubelchöre. Es ist müßig, in die Einzelkritik gehen zu wollen - hier eine Sitar (""Gone Are The Days"") oder dort eine Anlehnung an Lennon (""Tuff Love""). Denn die anderen Titel sind nett, aber vermasseln doch das Bild eines immer noch Ex-Beatle. Zu naiv und eindimensional erscheint dieses Album. Gelungen ist zumindest der Song ""Harry`s Song"", der zwar auch eine sehr schlichte Melodie besitzt, aber den früheren charmanten Beatles-Songs von Starr wie ""Yellow Submarine"" nahe kommt. Ansonsten bitte keine weiteren Alben - das ist nur was für wirklich beinharte Fans - für alle anderen Zeitverschwendung."
5,"Seit Tagen schon reizt es mich, hier auch eine Rezension zu schreiben, denn ich war von Anfang an ein großer Fan von Thomas  und von den Hörproben war ich total begeistert. Aber NEIN, nicht bevor ich eine CD mindestens 3 bis 4 mal komplett durchgehört habe. Seit ich sie heute Morgen bekommen habe, läuft sie fast ununterbrochen. Und das weil sie einfach wirklich klasse ist. Dabei möchte ich die deutschen Titel gar nicht so unbedingt hervorheben. Mir gefallen die englichen genauso gut. Ganz besonders liebe ich ""Too Young To Grow Old"". Aber auch I Don't Feel The Same, It's Beautiful, Summer Breeze oder When The Tears Are Falling. Das sind so Songs, die mit jedem weiteren hören besser werden. Thomas macht mit seiner wunderbaren, ausdrucksstarken Stimme aus jedem Song etwas ganz einmaliges. Da ist was an dieser Stimme, das hört man nicht nur, das fühlt man. Am wenigsten gefällt mir auf dieser CD übrigens ""Let It Be"". Diese Version kommt an den tollen Live-Auftritt in der Mottoshow nicht wirklich ran und will für mich nicht so recht zum Rest auf dem Album passen.   Ich bin mir sicher, dass diesem Album noch viele weitere folgen werden. Für mich ist Thomas Godoj ein Ausnahmekünstler, wie es schon lange keinen mehr gab. Nicht zuletzt seine zurückhaltende und bescheidene Art machen ihn so liebenswert. Ich wünsche ihm alles Glück der Welt und für die Zukunft VIEL ERFOLG"
1,"Zugegeben, ich habe diese CD gekauft, weil mich meine Gattin darauf aufmerksam gemacht hat. Die Werbung war vielversprechend.  Ich habe mit Spannung und Erwartung diese bisher unbekannte Musik angehört. Mein Effekt war: Ist das alles? Ist doch nichts neues. Alles ""déjà vu"" Effekte. So habe ich mich darüber geärgert, raffinierter Verkaufspropoganda aufgesessen zu sein. Mein Zweifel kommt auch auf, wenn ich die so vielen top-scored ratings sehe. Da vermute ich, dass dies inszeniert ist.  Begründung: Weil nebst dem Mix aus alles schon Dagewesenem von Pink Floyd bis Queen etc. ein weinig gemischt mit gängigem klassisch versuchtem Approach finde ich einfach nichts, was mich begeistern könnte. Die Pianopartitur ist erst noch dürftig gespielt und was am meisten auffällt, ist die schlechte Aufnahmequalität. So was von platt habe meiner Anlage schon lange nicht mehr zugemutet (ist eine deutsches top High-End Produkt, daran kann es nicht liegen). Fazit: viel Marketing, wenig Substanz. Diese CD kann man sich wirklich sparen."
5,"Man soll sich von Häns'che Weiss' skeptischem Blick auf dem Coverfoto nicht täuschen lassen: sein Debutalbum ist hervorragend gelungen. Für die Aufnahme hat er ein paar ganz junge Musiker um sich geschart, alle so um die 20. Er selbst war damals 21, hatte sich aber schon als Sologitarrist bei Schnuckenack Reinhardt einen Namen gemacht. Häns'ches Gitarrenstil ist natürlich von Django Reinhardt beeinflußt, man kann aber hören, dass auch die neueren Stile der Jazz-Gitarre nicht ganz spurlos an ihm vorbeigegangen sind. Der phänomenale Titi Winterstein an der Violine war gerade mal 15, unglaublich was der da schon drauf hatte. Von der ersten Nummer ""Sweet Georgia Brown"" an geht die Post ab, eine Mischung aus Jazzstandards und traditionellen Stücken. Wer bei solcher Musik ruhig sitzen bleiben kann, dem ist wirklich nicht zu helfen! Übrigens sind auch alle anderen Aufnahmen der Serie ""Musik deutscher Zigeuner"" schwer zu empfehlen."
2,"Dieses Ost-West-Meeting hätte richtig spannend werden können! Aber abgesehen von ganz wenigen genialen Dialogen ist es nur ein uninspiriertes additionelles Sitar-Guitar-Geplänkel. Kein Dialog! Nett anzuhören, aber keine Bereicherung. Schade drum."
5,"Mit Savane hat Ali Farka Toure uns ein großartiges Album hinterlassen. Desert-Blues pur ... aufgenommen teils im Hotel Mandé in Bamako ... ein ebenso großartiger Ort für Musikaufnahmen wie die eigentliche Musik, gelegen an den Ufern des Nigers merkt man zu keiner Zeit dass man sich am Rande der Hauptstadt des Landes befindet. Der Niger strahlt hier eine Ruhe und Kraft aus, die auch auf dem Album ständig zu spüren ist. Minimalistische Musik, ruhig und kraftvoll, genial. Bisher war Talking Timbuktu immer mein Lieblingsalbum von Ali Farka Toure, Savane hat es abgelöst. ALI FARKA TOURE - wir werden dich in Erinnerung behalten durch deine wunderschöne Musik die du uns geschenkt hast."
5,"Hooper ist zwar kein Williams, aber auf dem besten Weg dorthin! Denn dieser HP Soundtrack hat fast schon Williams Stil! Die Stücke sind magisch, schön und harmonieren perfekt! Schon die Einleitung ""Fireworks"" ist einfach nur genial. Und ich finde den Einsatz der E- Gitarre ziemlich passend. Auch das Theme von Umbridge ist absolut großartig und macht Spaß und ich finde das Stück richtig ""williamsch"" ;) Auch weiterhin wiederholt sich kaum etwas. Man bekommt immer was neues geboten und das Beste: Alles harmoniert miteinander, egal ob es ruhige, laute oder dramatische Passagen sind. Hooper versteht es die Musik perfekt umzusetzen und die Wirkung ist großartig!  Erwähnen sind noch ""Hall of Prophecies"", ""Death of Sirius"" und ""Flight of the Order of the Phoenix"" auch als Anspieltipps^^ Auch wenn die Musik mit 50 Minuten vielleicht etwas zu kurz ist, so bietet diese CD wirklich wunderschöne, bombastische und geniale Musik.  Sehr gut, Hooper!  Ich freu mich schon auf den bald erscheinenden Soundtrack vom Halbblutprinzen! ;-)"
2,"Diese Aufnahme kann ich nicht empfehlen. Das Klangbild erweist sich in weiten Teilen als sehr unausgewogen und wird der schlichten Schönheit der Komposition nicht gerecht. Insbesondere treten einzelne Stimmen mit solch nervtötender Penetranz hervor, daß es bisweilen in den Ohren schmerzt."
5,"Waren so die typischen Bands der Sechziger Jahre drauf? Drogentod in den eigenen Reihen (Keith Moon / Schlagzeug), Streitereien zwischen den Querköpfen Pete Townhshend (Gesang, Gitarre) und Roger Daltrey (Gesang)...."
5,"...dieses Werk geht unter die Haut. Das ich dieses Album, das auf alle Fälle eines der besten aller Zeiten ist, kenne habe ich meinen Eltern zu verdanken. Vor einigen Jahren zeigte mir meine Mutter mal eine Live-Aufführung von Tommy von The Who auf Video. Was soll ich sagen: es war Liebe auf das erste mal hören! Ich war so angetan davon, daß ich mir dann auch das CD-Doppelalbum meiner Eltern dazu anhörte. Von diesem Zeitpunkt an mußte ich es mir ständig anhören und gewisse Lieder wurden zu richtigen Ohrwürmern und ich bekam sie nicht mehr aus dem Kopf. Auch von den Texten, von der Handlung dieses Werks war ich zutiefst beeindruckt. So gefesselt wie dieses Album hat mich schon länger keines mehr. Schließlich kaufte ich es mir dann selbst auch, als dann die digitally remastered Version erschien. Seit der Erstentdeckung sind zwar schon mehrere Jahre vergangen, aber das ist ein Album das ich mir immer und immer wieder anhören kann, das mir niemals langweilig wird. Ich kann dieses Album nur schwerstens empfehlen! Übriges genauso wie die Verfilmung von Tommy mit Roger Daltrey in der Hauptrolle und großen Stars wie Tina Turner, Elton John, Eric Clapton und Jack Nicholson, sowie den dazugehörigen Soundtrack, was ich mir natürlich alles kaufen mußte. LONG LIVE THE WHO, LONG LIVE TOMMY!!!"
5,"Diese CD ist purer Live-Spaß. Von ""Heaven and Hell"" bis ""Magic Bus"" heißen Roger Daltrey, Pete Townshed, John Entwistle und Keith Moon dem Hörer ein. Kein Song ist schwach, alle überzeugen durch  einen schnellen Beat und eingängige Riffs. Covers wie ""Summertime  Blues"" werden in der Who-Version noch einen Tick besser. Durch die  Mitschnitte kommt man außerdem in den Genuß der Atmosphäre, wie sie an dem  Valtentinstag 1967 in Leeds war. Zugreifen heißt das Gebot der Stunde!"
1,"Was für eine schreckliche Enttäuschung, das Ende einer einstmals sehr guten Hörspielserie miterleben zu müssen. Und welche Unverschämtheit, dies dem Konsumenten heimlich unterjubeln zu wollen. Die Kritiken sprechen für sich, sowas rächt sich immer, die Serie ist tot. Schade um die guten Sprecher, die sich für sowas hergeben müssen, wahrscheinlich weil sie noch einen Vertrag zu erfüllen haben. Perlen vor die Säue nennt man das."
5,"wieder mal hat mickie es geschafft, mich mit seiner manchmal versauten, blöden musik zu begeistern. er ist und bleibt der könig von malle..."
2,"Lange haben wir auf einen würdigen Nachfolger von „Music ist ok""gewartet. Dieses Album kann jedoch keineswegs an seinen innovativen Vorgänger anschließen. Es klingt eher wie ein Schnellschuss, nachdem Koze's Adolf Noise Projekt ebenfalls nicht so eingeschlagen ist. So revolutionär wie die alten Stücke von Dj Koze bzw. Fischmob waren, so einfallslos hören sich die neuen an. Die verwendeten Synthies klingen wie aus den frühen Neunzigern und nur ab und zu schleichen sich etwas modernere Klänge dazwischen. Auch auf lustige Wortspiele wartet man hier vergebens. Die ganze Scheibe ist wieder sehr „technoid"", aber leider nicht so partytauglich wie sein Vorgänger. Das Album sollte eher als Sammlerstück für eingefleischte Koze-Fans verstanden werden. Hier bleibt nur zu sagen: „ Na Ja - Vielleicht klappt es ja beim nächsten mal wieder""."
4,"Rebellion schließen bald ihre Wikinger Trilogie mit einer letzten Scheibe ab! Vorher erscheint die EP ""The Clans Are Marching"".Da Gitarrist und Produzent im Frühjahr eine schweren Motorradunfall hatte, wonach er einige Zeit an Krücken gehen musste und auch im Krankenhaus war, hat sich der VÖ Termin des Albums um paar Monate nach hinten geschoben, weshalb wohl nun diese EP kommt. Der Titelsong, viele ahnen es schon ist eine Neuaufnahme des Grave Digger Oberhits ""Rebellion-The Clans Are Marching"", nach dem sich die Band benannt hat und deren Gründungsmitglieder und Songwriter Uwe Lulis &amp; Tomi Göttlich hier aktiv sind. Dieses Stück ist auch als Livevideo vom ""Summer Breeze"" auf der CD. Super umgesetzt, kein Nachteil zum Original! Dazu kommen noch drei Songs: Das mit Piano eingeleitete ""Midgard Arise"" ist im Midtempo und hat einschmeichelnde, dezente Chöre. Gänsehaut garantiert! ""Ragnarök"" ist eine härtere geradeaus nach vorne gekloppte Uptemponummer. Das balladesk beginnende ""My Blood In The Snow"" ist dann wieder typisch Rebellion: Knackige Riffs, theatralisch und mit einem galoppierenden Beat. Über allem thront Mike Seiferts dunkle, aber abwechslungsreiche Stimme. Ob die Songs bis auf das Titelstück exklusiv auf dieser EP sind, kann ich nicht sagen. Neue Ideen findet der Fan auf ""The Clans Are Marching"" jedoch nicht. Diese EP lässt auf das endlich im Juli erscheinende Album hoffen, obwohl ich solche nur vier Songs enthaltenen Silberlinge allgemein (übervolle Marktlage) schon etwas überflüssig finde! Eine frühere VÖ der EP mit mehr Material (wie einer Live DVD) wäre sicherlich geschickter gewesen?"
5,"Diese Platte ist so etwas wie meine CD des Monats. Auch, weil sie für mich völlig überraschend um die Ecke kam, denn von Babylon Circus hatte ich bislang noch nichts gehört. Dabei gibt es die Combo aus Lyon um die Köpfe und ehemaligen Clowns David &amp; Manu, die zusammen musizieren, seit sie 13 waren, schon seit über zehn Jahren. Doch bei ""la belle étoile"" stimmt einfach alles. Ein Album voller Energie, Spaß, Stil, Groove, Leidenschaft, Gefühl und Lebensfreude. Letzteres rührt bestimmt daher, das David bei einem Gig in Moskau nach einem nächtlichen Treppensturz dem Tod gerade noch so von der Schippe gesprungen ist. Stilistisch bewegen sich Babylon Circus auf einem Tableau von World-Beat, Ska, Balkan, punky Jazz, Acoustic-Guitar und natürlich französischem Chanson. Einen Song jetzt besonders hervorzuheben ist mir unmöglich, denn das Gesamtpaket ist einfach so stimmig. Bei jedem neuen Hören, fällt mir ein anderer Song besonders auf. Eine originelle Beschreibung liefert Sänger David: ""In meinen Augen ist das ganze so im Buster-Keaton-meets-Fear-and-Loathing-in-Las-Vegas-Stil gehalten."""
5,"War das nicht schon immer die gültige Steigerung bei Konstantin Wecker: Studioaufnahme &gt; Liveaufnahme &gt; Live-Zugabe. Konstantin weiß sehr wohl, wie man gutes Songmaterial im Studio ""aufbereitet"". Im Konzert aber schleift er die Rohdiamanten zu Juwelen. Weil er ein Ausprobierer ist, ein Verbesserer, ein Umarrangierer. Nichts mag er beschlossen sehen, sein Leben nicht, sein Werk nicht. Und genau diese Freude am Neuen überträgt sich auf den Konzertbesucher. Und spätestens bei den Zugaben hat er den Laden zum Kochen gebracht. - Richtig: Sehr viel Neues ist nicht auf dieser CD, doch würde ich das von einer ""Zugaben live"" genannten Platte auch nicht unbedingt erwarten. Aber das Irre ist: Gerade die ganz alten Braten faszinieren am meisten. Da kann ich mir gut einen Fan der 70er Jahre denken, dem bei dem innigst wie nie vorgetragenen ""Heut schaun die Madln wie Äpfel aus"" was Feuchtes in die Augen kommt. Vergleichbares gilt für ""Frieden im Land"", ""Endlich wieder unten"" (ohnehin mein erklärtes Wecker-Lieblingsstück) und ""Der alte Kaiser"". Und die eingestreuten Auszüge aus Konstantins Buch ""Die Kunst des Scheiterns"" sind klug gewählt und eine wunderbare Erheiterung zwischen manch ernster Thematik (Terror; Kriegsgebrüll). Mir jedenfalls geht Konstantin Wecker auch zu Beginn seines siebten Lebensjahrzehnts noch zu Herzen, ohne je kitschig zu sein. Diesen Großen Bären weiter in der Manege zu wissen, - das bereitet mir persönlich EIN GUTES GEFÜHL."
4,"Ich habe ihm diesen Mut nicht zugetraut. Bis zum 9. Track ein klasse Album  mit tollen, gut arrangierten Songs. Mal zärtlich, verträumt, mal versponnen, mal aggressiv. Track 10 bis 13 betrachte ich als Experiment. Ich finde, Paul sollte darauf verzichten."
4,"Willy Astor ist ein brillanter Kabarettist und Komödiant, welcher vor allem durch seine intelligenten Wortspiele sowie durch seine musikalischen Begabungen besticht. Seine Wortwitze, Schlagfertigkeiten sowie seine wohl pointierten und gut gesetzten Auftritte verleihen ihm weit über die Grenzen Bayerns hinaus einen entsprechenden Ruf. Mal gibt er den weltoffenen, weitgereisten, modernen, hippen Künstler, um sich schon im nächsten Moment als Grandseigneur der Bayerischen Urtümelei zu gebären. Und dies macht er meist richtig gut! Vor allem seine Wortspiele machen diese CD zu einem gelungenen Werk (hier sei nur mal die geniale Fußball-Reportagen-Imitation ""Adventsstadium"" genannt). Neben einigen kurzen, unterhaltsamen Gastauftritten von Michael Mittermeier, Otto Waalkes sowie Erkan &amp; Stefan, bietet die CD auch den Verwandlungskünstler Astor: Nämlich als Will Lee MC! Herrlich! Allerdings bleibt es bei der Fülle an Material nicht aus, dass auch das eine oder andere ""schwächere"" Stück vorhanden ist (""Persien sucht den Superschah"" wirkt etwas flach und das Lied ""Franzosenpack"" hat mich auch nicht vom Hocker gerissen - ebenso wie einige kürzere Wortspiele). Zu guter Letzt will ich noch die vielen Musikstücke erwähnen, welche das i-Tüpfelchen des Albums bilden. Die Melodien sind meist sehr eingängig und die Texte herrlich komisch... Eben typisch Astor!"
1,"Kriemhild Jahn, eine ausgebildete Sopranistin ???, wohlmöglich die deutsche netrebko???  au backe! frau jahn's stimme - bei allem respekt - reicht für schlager - und da ist sie ja bei ralph siegel genau richtig- aber bitte keine klassischen werke einsingen!  innovativ? weiss gott nicht - es handelt sich um instrumentale werke , die platte, pomadige texte aufgesetzt bekamen (in allen sprachen). mozart würde es sicherlich gruseln vor diesem werke."
5,"Ich liebe Musik und beim Anhören dieses Albums überkommt mich jedes Mal erneut große Freude. Jedem Liebhaber von spiritueller Musik wird das Herz wahrscheinlich ebenfalls aufgehen, wenn er in diese einmalige und abwechslungsreiche Musik-Zusammenstellung hineinhört. Es sind die wunderbaren Kompositionen und Energien vieler Musikerinnen und Musiker, die uns hier zufließen.  Ich bin einfach begeistert und empfehle diese CD sowohl den Neugierigen, die Hineinschnuppern wollen, als auch den Liebhabern, die musikalische Vielfalt auf einer CD wertschätzen - eine CD für besinnliche Stunden, romantische Abende, aber auch für lange Autofahrten und als Hintergrundmusik bei diversen Anlässen und mehr... Sie verdient weit mehr als  5 Sterne!"
2,"Die CD ist Durchschnitt, sicherlich nichts aussergewöhnliches, bietet vieles, was man schon ähnlich gehört hat.  Was ich vergeblich zu hören versuchte war ein Gefühl von Innigkeit, ein Gefangengenommen-werden von der Musik ergab sich leider nicht.  So bleibt nur die Hoffnung, irgendwann mal auf eine New Age-Produktion zu stossen, bei der das Keyboard nicht verwendet wurde ... ;-)"

5,"Als ich Black Raven live gesehen habe, war klar: Das Album brauche ich.  Und wie gut es ist, das war mir nach dem ersen song klar. ""Red light spells danger"" ist absolut cool. Mir gefällt auch ""Ain`t that too much"" extrem gut. Der Oberhammer ist aber der song ""The Anthem"". Nach ein paar Takten dachte ich: das kennst du doch aus den 80ern. Und jawoll, Black Raven haben aus dem Ärzte-song ""Was hat der Junge doch für Nerven"" eine klasse rockende englische Version gezaubert. Sehr gut gelungen. Alles in allem ein Album, das rockt!"
4,"Justus ist ganz aufgeregt, als er den Brief aus dem Umschlag holt, der bestätigt, dass er bei einer Quizshow teilnehmen darf. Hinter dem Quiz steht ein Verbrechen, das Justus, Peter, und Bob zu lösen versuchen. Sie treiben immer weiter in die Geschichte rein... Die Geschichte gefällt mir sehr gut, weil es immer spannend bleibt. Die immer schwerer werdenden Rätsel bereiten den drei ??? Kopfzerbrechen. Was mir nicht soo gefällt sind die Sprecherleistungen. Es scheint als würden sie nicht wissen um was es geht. deswegen auch nur 4 Sterne."
2,"Ich war sehr gespannt auf das neue Album von PUR - dann jedoch auch ziemlich enttäuscht, weshalb ich der breiten Masse hier einfach mal widersprechen muss. Dieses Album ist schon ZU emotional und wie hier schon jemand geschrieben hat, lässt es nicht genug Freiräume für die eigene Phantasie und Gefühle...Ein Mann, in dessen Leben viel geschehen ist, der all dies verarbeitet und in schöne Musik verpackt - schön und gut, aber ich möchte eigentlich nicht immer an Hartmut Engler's Sorgen und Nöte erinnert werden, wenn ich dieses eher depressive Album höre (mit ein paar Ausnahmen natürlich). Ich finde dieses Album einfach schon zu persönlich, was mir nicht gefällt. Ein Schuss mehr Fröhlichkeit und Lieder, die POSITIV mitreißen, wäre dann doch ganz schön gewesen."
1,Was ist bloß passiert? Seit 2003 versorgen Die Ärzte ihre Fans mit aufgewärmtem und bereits bekanntem Material. Das äußerte sich bereits in der unnötigerweise wiederaufgelegten Debil. Dieses Best Of besteht aus 2 Cds. Auf der ersten Cd befinden sich alle Singles seit 1993. Hat man da nicht etwas vergessen? Die Ärzte gabs doch schon in den 80ern. Also fehlen gut 10 Jahre an möglichen Best of Singles. Die zweite Cd besteht aus B-Seiten der Singles von 1993 bis heute. Eigentlich das einzig Interessante an dieser Best Of. Jeder Fan wird die Singles der ersten Cd bereits besitzen. Für Ärzte-Neueinsteiger ist dieses Best Of zu empfehlen. Es gibt einen Überblick über eine wichtige Zeitperiode der Band. Für Fans bietet diese Cd absplut nichts Neues. Keine neuen Songs. Kein Bonus Material. Sogar das Cover Artwork scheint nur arg bei der Cd Kiss - Double Platinum abgeschaut.
1,"Infinty on High war ja schon nicht mehr das was man von FOB erwartet bzw erhofft hat. Aber die neue Scheibe hat ja gar nichts mehr mit der Musik zu tun mit der FOB groß rausgekommen sind. Teilweise fehlen mir da echt die Worte.... der Mann kann nunmal nicht singen, was er live ja auch immer auf beeindruckende Art und Weise unter Beweis stellt. Muß man ja auch nicht zwangsläufig um gute Musik zu machen. Aber so zu tun als ob ist nur peinlich. Für mich ist diese Band gestorben, was ich wie gesagt sehr schade finde."
5,"Der Sommer kann kommen! Wer auf diesem Album nicht seinen persönlichen Sommerhit findet ist selber schuld. Mal verträum, ein bisschen verspiel und immer mit viel, ich nenn es mal, afrikanischen Soul in der Stimme! Das einzige  was ich zu bemängeln habe ist, dass es leider nur 10 Songs sind und ich schon ewig auf ein neues Album warte! Mehr davon!"
1,"Der Sound der gesamten ""Remaster""-CD von Gary Moore ist akustischer Schrott. Ich habe mich sehr geärgert, mir die aufgrund des günstigen Preises gleich im Paket zugelegt zu haben.  Eine Frechheit - nur Höhen, kein Baß und nix. Einfach nur schlecht. Und das ist schade - denn das Album ist natürlich über jeden Zweifel erhaben und die Boni machen eigentlich einen Knaller daraus - daher ein Stern. Der miese Brotbüchsensound macht aber leider alles zunichte ! Daher Finger weg !"
5,"Ich finde das neue Album super.Wer diese Musik nicht mag, muss sie ja nicht kaufen oder hören - man wird dazu ja nicht gezwungen.Es sind einige tolle Lieder drauf. Für Leute die diese Musik mögen, auf jeden Fall kaufenswert!"
1,Oh Nic was hast Du getan. Dieses Album ist absolut GRAUENVOLL. Das erste Album von Nic war super aber was ist das hier bitteschön ??? Unterderduschestehenundsingen ???. Ich frage mich wie soetwas auf den Markt kommen darf. Ich muss dazu sagen ich bin ein großer Schlager Fan aber hier hört es auf. 1 Stern ist noch zuviel.
1,"ist es, was hier passiert. Ein virtueller Jamba-Hase meets Schlagersänger. Voll neben der Spur und so schlecht, dass man am liebsten nach Afghanistan auswandern möchte. Aber nichts kann schließlich in Deutschland so doof sein, als das nicht noch irgendein Doofer diesen Schrott kaufen würde. Die ganze Welt lacht über den Musikgeschmack der Deutschen und über die Titel, die sich bei uns in den Charts auf den Spitzenplätzen tummeln. Aber hier in Deutschland sind die Menschen glücklich mit dem Schrott. Hauptsache es ist nicht anspruchsvoll, man muss nicht nachdenken und kann den Titel nach 2 Minuten mitklatschen oder mitsingen. Bravo! Ganz toll. Eine Stunde auf dem WC ist interessanter und anspruchsvoller als dieser ""Song""."
2,das mixtape hätte mehr originelle texte vertragen können und somit sind nur 4 lieder gut der rest is nur ein billiger versuch wie ein gangsta zu klingen. da is ja der schrott neger neger von b-tight noch besser also nicht kaufen
2,"Die typisch irische Leichtigkeit fehlt.Ich hab sie nicht ganz gehört, aber viel ""irisches"" entdecke ich daran nicht. Auch der Rythmus ist nicht zum Aufspringen, oder mitsummen was sehr schade ist."
5,"Wie auch immer man zur Gattung des Musicals steht - diese einmalige Aufnahme des nahezu vollständig auf klassischem Instrumentarium eingespielten Opus von Björn Ulvaeus (Text) und Benny Andersson (Musik) steht herausragend in dem sonst belanglosen Katalog von Musicalproduktionen dieser Welt. Neben der gemeinsamen Vergangenheit mit ABBA dürfte dieses 3-Stunden-Werk von 1996 das zweite ""Lebenswerk"" der beiden B's sein, die Essenz ihres bisherigen musikalischen Schaffens. Dabei ist die Geschichte typisch schwedisch: die Überfahrt schwedischer Emmigranten nach Amerika im 19. Jahrhundert. Bis auf wenige Momente gibt es keine an Abba erinnernde Hits, dafür anspruchsvolle Orchestersinfonik gepaart mit Elementen ur-schwedischer Volksmusik made by Benny. Auf eine englische Produktion wartet man bis heute leider vergebens."
2,"Ähnlich wie bei seiner Bach-pur-CD drückt Stadtfeld auch hier mächtig aufs Gaspedal. Gerade beim Kopfsatz des d-moll-Konzertes überdreht er derart das Tempo, sodass der Satz völlig seine Wirkung verliert. Was hat er sich wohl dabei gedacht ? Tempo hat nichts mit Drive oder Swing zu tun! Er spielt die Konzerte wie eine große Finger-Etüde, was an vielen Stellen brilliant klingen mag, jedoch den Sinn dieser Musik verfehlt. Sehr schade !"
5,"Seit Glenn Gould wieder mal ein ""junger Wilder"" der Bach in einer erfrischenden neuen Art spielt. Bach selbst wäre wahrscheinlich angetan gewesen von Stadtfelds Interpretation auf dem Flügel. Immerhin hat ja auch Bach das Cembalo weiterentwickelt und war neuen Instrumenten mehr als aufgeschlossen. Stadtfeld schöpft die Möglichkeiten eines modernen Konzertflügels voll aus und bringt uns einen Bach der eben zeitlos ist."
5,"Vergleicht man das erste Band des Wohltemperierten Klaviers mit dem zweiten, so wird man auch bei oberflächlicher Betrachtung bald die Feststellung machen, daß das erste Band wesentlich kompakter und einheitlicher wirkt, während es sich beim zweiten Band um Werke handelt welche in einer größeren Zeitspanne entstanden sind, und somit in gewisser Weise verschiedenere Facetten von Bachs genialem Schaffen offenbaren.  Nun, daß Glenn Goulds Aufnahmen provozieren und polorisieren ist wohl eine unbestrittene Tatsache; daher verwundert es wohl kaum, daß Gould-Fans wahre Anhänger des kanadischen Ausnahmepianisten sind, während viele andere sein Spiel äußert kritisch und skeptisch hinterfragen. Ein exzellentes Beispiel hierfür wäre etwa die Fuge in E-Dur. Man blickt in die Noten und meint die Absicht des so großen Meisters Bach klar erkannt zu haben: ein langsamer Choral, welcher an die Gesänge des Mittelalters erinnert. Gould jedoch scheut sich nicht davor diese Fuge doppelt so schnell, non legato und staccato zu spielen. Aber dennoch muß man sagen: das klingt! Auch eine solche Interpration kann also überzeugen, und Gould macht vor, auf welch vielfältige Art und Weisen Bachs Musik klingen kann.  Unbestritten muß festgehalten werden, daß Gould manuell ein sehr begaber Mensch war, verfügte er doch seinerzeit über eine vortreffliche Technik, welche es ihm ermöglichte auch in den schnellsten Passagen kristallklar zu spielen. Und wen verwundert es also, daß alle polyphonen Werke in voller Selbstverständlichkeit in größter Klarheit erklingen.  Die Tonqualität ist ordentlich, etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig sicherlich der Gesang des Pianisten, welcher hin und wieder mehr oder weniger deutlich zu hören ist."
5,"Ich war gestern auf dem Scars on Broadway Konzert in Köln und die Playlist umfasste 10 Songs: -I Like Suicide -Stoner Hate -World Long Gone -Enemy -Whore Street -Kill Each Other -Chemicals -Universe -Cute Machines -They Say Das Konzert war wirklich erste Sahne, die Songs waren richtig fetzig, und denjenigen, die System of a Down mochten, kann ich Scars on Broadway nur empfehlen. Die Lieder haben alle etwas vertautes, da Daron Malakian auch einen Großteil der Songs für SOAD geschrieben hat. Für alle anderen kann ich nur sagen: vorher mal reinhören."
4,"Die Jungs um Darius Rucker hatten es natürlich wirklich schwer, nach dem ersten Megaseller und zwei weiteren, ganz guten CDs dieses Level zu halten. Die 4. Scheibe mit alten Coverversionen ging ja etwas daneben und nun also der 5. Schaffensakt, diesmal eingespielt mit Starproduzent Don Was. Und, ja, es ist zum Glück wieder besser geworden. Immer noch nicht die ""alte"" Klasse und auch Wettbewerber wie die COUNTING CROWS werden nicht erreicht, aber ""Space"", ""The Rain Song"" und der ""hidden track"" lassen wieder hoffen. Weiter so !"
5,"Als ich diese CDs das erste Mal gesehen habe, war ich ziemlich kritisch. Aber nach dem ersten Hören dachte ich ""Wow!"". Alles, was mir im Film gefehlt hat, wurde nun auf anregende, einfühlsame und zugleich entspannende Art und Weise dargestellt. Jeder, der sich bisher nichts unter den Gedichten Tolkiens aus dem ""Herrn der Ringe"" vorstellen konnte, findet hier die gelungene Mischung aus brillianter Umsetzung von Tolkiens Versen und musikalischer Perfektion. Ein Muss für jeden Tolkien-Fan!"
1,"Zumindest ist Star Wars Episode II - Attack Of The Clones der schlechteste Star Wars-Soundtrack. Einzig der Star Wars-Main Title hat Stil, der ist aber viel zu kurz. Ansonsten ist die CD einfach nur langweilig. Ich habe mich zwingen müssen, den Soundtrack komplett durchzuhören in der Hoffnung, irgendwo noch eine gute Stelle zu finden, aber bei aller Liebe zu Star Wars: das beste ist nach ein paar Sekunden schon gelaufen."
1,"Als ich diesen Soundtrack hörte war ich schon sehr enttäuscht. Denn die Beats vom Film fehlen einfach drauf. Nur Hip-Hop und Rap ist einfach nichts für jene, die nach dem Film (Szene in der Disco) sich schon auf heißen Techno am Soundtrack freuten. Schade eigentlich!!"
2,"Der Titelsong ist das Beste, aber eben gerade nicht auf dieser CD. Der Inhalt der hiesigen CD ist an sonsten Ok. Aber eben UNVOLLSTÄNDIG."
4,"Nur 15 Tage hatte Marco Beltrami Zeit, um den neuen Film von Alex Proyas zu vertonen, und nicht weniger als 11 Orchestrierer durften ihn bei seiner Arbeit unterstützen. Dass das Ergebnis am Ende ein großartiger und vor allem im Film äußerst effektiver Score geworden ist, ist Beltramis guten Instinkten, starken Themen und einem sehr persönlichen Stil zu verdanken, der sich selbst bei einer solchen Armada an Helfershelfern zu behaupten weiß. Basierend auf einem einprägsamen und flexiblen Hauptthema - zum ersten Mal zu hören in Stück 3, ""I, Robot Theme (End Credits)"" - entfaltet sich die Score-CD auf abwechsungsreiche Weise bis hin zum vielschichtigen Finale in ""Round Up"". Dazwischen gibt es sowohl Beltramis übliche rhythmisch vetrackte Action-Musik zu hören (""Tunnel Chase"", ""Need Some Nanites"" u.a.) wie auch atmosphärisch mysteriöse (""Sonny's Interrogation"") und einfühlsam dramatische Momente (""Spooner Spills"" und vor allem ""Dead Robot Walking"")."
2,"Elina Garanca verfügt über eine bombastische Technik! Doch ihr Mozart-Gesang lässt mich kalt! Da kommt einfach nichts rüber, was die Seele berührt! Sie kann mit ihren Kolleginnen Maria Stader und Edda Moser überhaupt nicht konkurrieren!"
1,"Da mich dieser ""Hit"" von Pachelbel schon lange begleitet und ich kaum ein Musikstück kenne, das so zu Herzen geht, war ich entsetzt davon, was diese Cd aus meinem Kleinod macht! Von Kaufhausmusik änlichem Geplänkel bis zum Musikantenstadltauglichen Getröte - alles dabei. Also, ich muss doch sehr bitten!"
2,"Hallo. Meine Bewertung lautet        3+ Ich habe mehr ""Chor"" erwartet. sibbyy"
5,"All right now, Lady in black, Tonight(Move), Paranoid, Easy Living, Treffpunkt Teich an der Matthias-Claudius-Str. in Bochum (nahe Stadion, genau dort wohnt heute ein Ex-Profi des VfL, super Typ, talentierte Kids, -hi Harry,hi Sabine)und der Gruß an David Christopher John Coleman, -Jugend PUR- Danke MAL. DAVE"
5,"Suede gelten als erste Band jenes Genres, mit dessen späteren wichtigsten Exponenten (Oasis, Blur, Pulp, The Verve u.a.) sie eigentlich relativ wenige musikalische Berührungspunkte hatte: Britpop. Wenn auch David Bowie, The Smiths oder die Anfang der Neunziger in England grassierende Shoegazer-Welle nicht nur auf die Londoner Band einen mächtigen Einfluss ausübten, so waren Suede doch von allen Anfang an ""anders"": pathetisch, ja schwülstig, romantisch. Dank des divenhaften, exzentrischen  Sängers Brett Anderson verbreiteten Suede Anfang der Neunziger  eine Aura von Glamour, Androgynität, (vermeintlicher) sexueller Ambivalenz und narzisstisch gefärbtem Weltschmerz. Mit dem damals vorherrschenden US-amerikanischen Grunge und dessen striktem Berufsethos (Verweigerungshaltung, null Glamour, schlichte, harte Songs u.ä.) hatten Suede somit wenig gemeinsam."
2,"Als echter Fan des Brit-Pop kommt man nun einmal nicht an Suede vorbei. Also ließ ich mich dazu hinreißen, mit 'Head Music' eine ihrer CDs sozusagen zum Testhören zu erwerben. Ich kann meine Enttäuschung gar nicht in Worte fassen. Bei all dem Jubel, der Suede stets begleitete, hätte ich wirklich mehr erwartet. Tatsächlich machen sie intelligente Popmusik - jedenfalls was den musikalischen Teil betrifft. Wie man allerdings die Stimme von Brett Anderson der netten Musik zuliebe überhören kann, habe ich noch nicht herausgefunden. 'Savoir faire' etwa ist ein wirklich gutes Stück - bis er kommt und den Song im Keim erstickt. Wirklich - wer diese Band mit Joy Division oder David Bowie vergleicht, der erkennt zwar die musikalischen Vorbilder, tut diesen aber mehr als Unrecht.  Wem Stimme und Texte etwas bedeuten, dem kann ich nur abraten! Haltet Euch lieber an die Vorbilder!"
5,"° Nur selten findet man einen Film, bei dem der Soundtrack so gut dazu passt wie bei ´Bandits´. Film und Soundtrack sind hier einfach aus einem Guss. Von rockigen Songs bis hin zu Balladen ist so ziemlich für jeden Geschmack was dabei. Und wer den Film gesehen hat, fühlt sich beim Musikhören gleich wieder mittendrin. Der Soundtrack lohnt sich auf jeden Fall."
5,"Was soll ich sagen, ich bin beeindruckt.  Nach dem letzten Album das einfach nur gaaanz, gaaanz große Kunst war, ist dieses Album ein Speigel des Repertoires von Herrn Kemmler. Da ist vom allem was er kann etwas drauf und das erstklassig produziert und Hubi's Stimme , ach........ Feinster Dancepop""Psycho radio"", sanfter Elektro""no rain"", harmonische Akkustik""Wenn der Mond die Sonne berührt....wie herrlich.  Dann diese grandiose deutsche Version von C'est la vie""Willkommen im Leben""...irre! Also Danke Hubert!"
5,"Remixalben spalten für gewöhnlich die Hörerschaft in zwei Lager. Für die einen sind sie unnötige Zugaben, die eh nicht an die Qualität der Originale heranreichen und lediglich dazu da sind, den Fans noch etwas Geld aus der Tasche zu ziehen. Für die anderen stellen Remixe oftmals interessante Interpretationen dar, die so den Fokus auf gewisse Parts des Originals legen oder eben etwas gänzlich Neues erschaffen.  Ein Paradebeispiel dieser Polarisierung ist Nine Inch Nails' ""Fixed"".  Die zugrunde liegende ""Broken EP"" ist ein schwerer, gitarrenorientierter Brocken Wut und Härte, die nicht nur im Zusammenhang mit dem ""Broken-Movie"" gerade zu verstörend wirkte.  ""Fixed"" ist ein wahres Pendant. Die Gitarren treten deutlich in den Hintergrund, die Elektronik dominiert und zerstückelt die Originale wie ""Gave Up"", ""Happiness In Slavery"", ""Last"" oder ""S*ck"" bis ins Unkenntliche.  Songstrukturen gibt es nur wenige. Beats werden nach kurzer Zeit abgewürgt, abgehackt, rückwärtslaufen gelassen. Hier fällt ein Loop eines Gitarrenriffs rein und verschwindet urplötzlich wieder. Lyrics und Sprachsamples tauchen auf, brennen sich ein und lassen den Hörer zeitweise recht ratlos stehen.  ""Gave Up"" bietet treibende elektronische Drums und zerfetzte Textfragmente. ""Wish"" dagegen bleibt am nächsten am Original, wird jedoch in eingebettet in ein Plätzchen inmitten von Nagelteppichen und Stacheldraht. ""Happiness In Slavery"" verkommt zu einem monotonen Stampfer, der sich unentwegt seinen Weg ins Hirn bahnt.  ""Throw This Away"" verfügt über ein dreieinhalb-minütiges Intro mit dezenten Gitarren und verspielten Electrosounds und überrascht danach mit einem vorschnellen Ende. Bei ""Fist F**k"" fräst sich dann ein Gitarrensample durch das Gehör, daß sich mit verschwommenen wirkenden Drums mischt.  Den absoluten Knaller, den man nur lieben oder hassen kann, stellt ""Screaming Slave"" dar. Ein disharmonisches Klanggewitter, bei dem wohl alle Regler gedreht und eine riesen Palette an Effekten zu einem wahnsinnigen Konstrukt zusammengefügt wurden.  ""Fixed"" ist ein Sammelsorium an elektronischen Möglichkeiten, das kompromissloser wohl nicht hätte ausfallen können. Mit Chris Vrenna, Peter Christopherson, J.G. Thirlwell, Butch Vig und Sean Beavan standen Trent Reznor bekannte Namen zur Seite, die zusammen ein abgefahrenes Kopfkino erschaffen haben."
5,"Gestern habe ich The Fragile wieder unter meiner Musik entdeckt. Diese Musik zieht mich immer wieder in ihren Bann. Egal wie ich mich weiter entwickle, es trifft mich immer wieder mitten ins Herz, mitten in die Seele. Eines der besten Alben, die es überhaupt gibt. Je weiter du dich entwickelst, um so tiefer steigst du ein in die Welt von Trent Reznor."
1,Ja Ja .... mann braucht nach 4 Alben schon mal ein best of das ist klar aber unter best of verstehe ich auch best of...und nicht zusammenstellung aller Singels..nur weil ein Song als singel erscheint ist er noch lange nicht gut! Die Tracks sind so lieblos zusammengestellt wie auch das neue Album der Ninjas! Beides Taugt absolut nix und ist das Geld nicht wert!
1,"Schade, weil es zig wirklich gute Balkan-Musik gibt (schauen sie dochmal ins World-Regal), die es niemals in die Marketingmaschine schaffen wird.  Diese CD ist quasi ein Sample, ein kurzer uninspirierter Ausschnitt dessen, was diese Musik eigentlich ausmacht - Gefühl. Hier wird quasi gewaltsam kopiert - mit penetranter Art ein Sound fabriziert, der, wenn man denn wirklich zuhört - einfach nur nervt. Das ist nicht authentisch und vorallem kein  ""Balkan-Blues"". Schlimm, hier wird ""ENDLICH ECHTE MUSIK"" suggestiert - und es wird geglaubt. Dabei stehen die wirklich guten Künstler dieser Gattung eher im Abseits. Schade find ich das."
5,"Wer den Film Forrest Gump kennt und gesehn hat, wird ihn sicher toll finden. Doch das auch wegen der Musik. Alte Klassiker hauptsächlich aus den 60ern sind im Film zu hören. Titel wie ""Sweet Home Alabama"", ""Fortunate Son"" oder auch ""Hound Dog"", alles das sind geile Songs die einen der besten Filme aller Zeiten untermalen und ihn so nahezu perfekt machen.  Fazit: Soundtracksammler MÜSSEN die Cd kaufen, andere, die den Film mögen eigentlich auch. Klasse, Klasse, Klasse"
2,"Viel Musik für wenig Geld, aber nicht zuviel erwarten, es sind teilweise Lieder enthalten, die wirklich wenig mit celtic music zu tun haben, sondern mehr zu alternativen Musik passen, wer aber offen für andere Musikarten ist, eine gute Anschaffung"
5,"Ein Thema, bei dem man sich fragt, warum es bislang noch nie in dieser Reihe aufgetaucht ist. Immerhin passt es wirklich in den Rahmen wie die sprichwörtliche Faust aus's Auge. Das macht sich allein dadurch bemerkbar, wie wenig aufgesetzt die Einbindung hier wirkt. Natürlich folgt man trotzdem dem gängigen Erzählmuster - Neue Schülerin, neues Problem - aber die Brisanz des Motivs ist in einer eher auf seichte Unterhaltung ausgelegten Serie schon beachtlich. Dabei kann man sich vielleicht ein wenig daran reiben, dass das unvermeidliche Happy End die Ernsthaftigkeit ein wenig verwässert und so das Ganze vielleicht harmloser dargestellt wird, als es in Wirklichkeit ist. Andererseit kann das den positiven Aspekt, dass man sich damit überhaupt befasst, nicht aufheben. Die Umsetzung entspricht dem typischen soliden Standard von Studio Körting. So, wie man die Serie seit Jahr(zehnt)en kennt, klingt auch diese Produktion. Es ist immer wieder überraschend, wie gut und glaubhaft die Sprecherinnen in ihren Rollen agieren können. Immerhin versieht die Lindenhof-Stammcrew seit 35 Jahren ihren Dienst als Teenager. Auch in den Gastrollen agieren ""alte Hasen"". Die Leistungen sind durch die Bank gut. Nichts Neues gibt es bei der musikalischen Untermalung. Wie eh und je, setzt man auf die sehr typische 70er-Jahre-Musik, die ja zwischenzeitlich das Tal des Altbackenen durchschritten hat und jetzt als ""Retro"" wieder cool und hip ist. ""Hanni und Nanni"" bleibt die perfekte Reihe für die Generation Kassettenkind. Hier hat sich seit 1974 in der Darstellung kaum etwas geändert. Die Themen wurden zwar moderner, aber die Machart bleibt die Gleiche. Dass man den alten Fans diese Nostalgie belässt, ist schon aller Ehren wert, dass man zudem es hier noch schafft, zeitgemäße Themen ansprechend einzubinden, ist ein gern gehörter Bonus. Auch diese Folge schafft diesen Spagat zwische Nostalgie und Originalität und überzeugt mit einer guten und sehr unterhaltsamen Geschichte. Fans der Reihe müssen - alle anderen sollten hier zumindest ein Ohr riskieren."
5,Habe mir die CD zum Buch gekauft. Jeder jung gebliebenerDDR Bluesfan wird sich an die Mugge erinnern können. CD kann ich sehr empfehlen. Alles in sehr guten Stereo Klang Ton.
5,"Ich kann nur sagen wem Getting away with Murder gefallen hat, der findet dieses Album mindestens genauso gut. Einfach CD einlegen und auf play drücken. Jacoby's Stimme is wieder sensationell. Kann ich nur empfehlen, hat mir auf Anhieb gefallen."
5,"In irgendeiner anderen Rezension zu Elbow’s “Leaders of the Free World” habe ich mal gelesen, dieses Album sei Coldplay für Betrunkene. Lustige Behauptung, die aber den Nagel auf den Kopf trifft. Elbow sind alte Hasen des Britpop, bekannt für ihre ausladenden Britpop-Hymnen. Auf diesem Album gibt es all dies in Fülle, allerdings haben sie dem Bombast etwas rausgenommen und lassen die Songs etwas nüchterner klingen. Allerdings hat das Ganze vereinzelt immer noch einen schrägen verspielten Touch, was wohl dieses „Coldplay für Betrunkene“ erklären kann. Elbow können sowohl rockige Pophymnen machen, als auch todtraurige Balladen, die selbst Chris Martin zu weinen bringen würde. Gerade zu meisterlich verschmelzen diese beiden Eigenschaften zu 11 tollen bis fantastischen Songs voller Drive und Melodie. „Stadion Approach“ startet das Album langsam bevor es sich aufbaut, bloß um mit „Picky Bugger“ gleich wieder in einen smoothen, chilligen Song überzugehen. Danach folgen durchgehend Highlights. Der Titelsong „Leaders of the Free World“ besticht nicht nur mit einer coolen politischen Botschaft, sondern auch mit seinem rockigen Drive. Auch „Mexican Standoff“ mit seinen südamerikanischen Einflüssen groovt gemütlich vor sich hin. Die ruhigen melancholischen Nummer wie „The Everthere“, „Great Expectations“ oder „My Very Best“ bestimmen dann die zweite Hälfte des Albums. Voller Gefühl schwanken sie zwischen Trauer und Schönheit ohne aber zu sehr ins „Sülzige“ abzugleiten. Immerhin das haben Elbow Coldplay voraus. Wer auf guten Gitarrenpop steht sowie auf eine gute Instrumentierung und tolle Melodien, der kommt an diesem Album definitiv nicht vorbei. Elbow präsentieren ein echtes klasse Album und zeigen der Konkurrenz, dass sie nichts von ihrer Klasse eingebüßt haben. Auch Nüchtern zu genießen."
1,"Fast seit den ersten Tönen, die Live auf CD veröffentlicht hat, gehört die Band zu meinen absoluten Favoriten. Und wie immer war ich schon sehr gespannt auf das neue Album. Doch was ich da zu hören bekam, war die größte Enttäuschung, die mir Live je bereitet hat. Die Band hat immer mal ihren Stil ein wenig variiert, mal stärkere, mal schwächere Alben abgeliefert - aber sie blieb sich treu, selbst die langsameren Stücke hatten Biss. Doch ""Songs from Black Mountain"" ist völlig zahnlos, eine Aneinanderreihung von müden Songs, von denen einer wie der andere klingt - teilweise muß man sich wirklich Mühe geben, die Songs voneinander trennen zu können, da sie müde ineinander über plätschern. Ein oder zwei Tiefschläge auf einer CD - ok, lass' ich mir gefallen. Aber was Live hier abliefert, könnte man schon fast als Etikettenschwindel bezeichnen. Wenn nicht die markante Stimme des Sängers wäre, könnte man es für eine 08/15-Mainstream-Blabla-Scheibe von irgendeiner x-beliebigen Band halten. Man kann nur hoffen, dass die Band mit dem nächsten Album wieder zu ihrem alten Drive zurückfindet. Live-Fans, die auch wirklich Live hören wollen, kann ich nur empfehlen, diese Scheibe nicht zu kaufen."
5,"Das dritte Album in einem Jahr und wieder was anderes: nach Pop (""Cold Roses"") und Country (""Jacksonville City Lights"") nun ein Soloalbum ohne die Cardinals, das nicht ganz so gängig einzuordnen ist. Es klingt sehr viel persönlicher als die beiden vorigen Alben und ist auch extrem sparsam instrumentiert (meist nur Piano und/oder Gitarre). Die Texte wirken sehr persönlich, ob sie es wirklich sind, vermag ich nicht zu sagen, dem Chamäleon Adams ist zuzutrauen, dass er diese ganzen Lebensbeichten genauso aus dem Ärmel schüttelt, wie er Melodien en gros produziert. Der Rolling Stone schrieb, Adams' Problem bei dieser CD sei, dass er, statt 3 Alben in Rekordzeit einzuspielen, sich mal lieber mit mehr Sorgfalt seinen Songs widmen sollte. Man höre den Liedern auf ""29"" an, dass sie mal eben so geschrieben seien worden. Das kann ich nach den ersten Höreindrücken nicht bestätigen, das sind keine hingerotzten Stücke, sondern bei aller Schlichtheit schon musikalische Leckerbissen, deren Arrangement auch noch im Minimalismus durch eine gewisse Raffinesse besticht. Und für Textzeilen wie ""One night at the diner over eggs / Over easy she showed me the length of her legs"" muss man ihn einfach lieben. Textlich begibt er sich aber auch auf durchaus hohes, wenn nicht gar literarisches Niveau: selten gab es so viele interpretierbare Leerstellen in seinen Texten, die diesmal zwischen kleinen Anekdoten und komplexen Kurzgeschichten schwanken. Insgesamt hat er es also mal wieder geschafft sein Publikum zu verblüffen: dreimal Ryan Adams in einem Jahr, dreimal ein ganz anderes Album - welcher Künstler kann das schon von sich behaupten?"
2,"Ich weiß noch wie enttäuscht ich war, als Patrice nach der Nile-Tour und dem folgenden Umzug in die USA eine Schaffenspause ankündigte. Ich habe seine zwei Shows in Hamburg (Docks/Stadtpark) gesehen und war ob seiner unbekümmerten charmanten Energie vollends des Lobes. Die Konzerte haben mich restlos begeistert...so jung, so authentisch, so sympathisch, so talentiert und die Welt steht ihm offen, habe ich gedacht! Ich persönlich zähle Nile zum Höhepunkt seines Schaffens (anders als es andere versierte Kenner tun), da ich von seiner Bandbreite an Möglichkeiten (Funk, Ragga, Roots, Soul und Pop zu verschmelzen) sehr angetan bin. Mit anderen Worten: Ich bin sehr beeindruckt von seiner Musik, seiner Person und dem Gesamtkunstwerk!  Das neue Album (habe mir am Erscheinungstag die de luxe-Edition gegönnt)....finde ich sehr flau und unausgegoren! Alle Songs sind mehr oder weniger in einem midtempo vorgetragen. Der afrikanische Bezug will sich nicht so recht einstellen, da sowohl treibende Rhythmik, als auch rootsartige Gesangslinien fehlen. Für mich ist es vielmehr ein seichter Gitarrenzupf und -akkordbrei, der eine klare Differenzierung des einen von dem anderen Song aufhebt. Klar, die Texte sind wieder ansprechend, aber auch hier scheinen ihm die Ideen auszugehen. Ich bin doch arg enttäuscht und hätte so ein unpointiertes Album eigentlich nicht für möglich gehalten. Ich weiß gar nicht, für wen diese Art von Musik eigentlich etwas ist. Damit ihr mich nicht falsch versteht: Dieses Album ändert nichts an meiner absolut positiven Grundhaltung ggü den Künstler! Als Einstieg, um ihn kennenzulernen, kann ich diese Produktion aber auf keinen Fall empfehlen. Hätte er sich doch nur seine ""Schaffenspause"" gegönnt....."
5,"Patrice (diesmal mit Unterstützung des Silly Walks Movement) hats wieder mal geschafft: eine absolut tolle PLatte, mit Songs zum Feiern, Relaxen, Träumen und Genießen. Nachdem ""How Do you call it?"" sich etwas weiter vom Reggea entfernt hatte ist mit dieser Platte wieder der ""alte"" Patrice à la ""Ancient Spirit"" zurück. Mir machts jedesmal aufs Neue Spaß die Lieder zu hören!! Anspieltipps: ""Moonrise"" und ""I'll be near"" einziges Manko: mit knapp 45 Minuten ist die Platte leider nicht sehr lang"
2,"Irgendwie komm ich nicht drum herum ein wenig enttäuscht von diesem Album zu sein, die Songs am Anfang sind zwar gut gewählt, die Songs am Schluss ebenfalls, aber der ganze Mittelteil mit den kurzen Songs ist mehr oder weniger eine totale Enttäuschung. Ja, es ist lustig, dass die Band einen Haufen kurzer Songs hat, aber warum man diese ausgerechnet bei diesen Liveaufnahmen spielen musste will mir aber nicht ganz einleuchten. An sich liebe ich diese Band ja, aber es gibt einfach zu viele wirklich um Längen bessere Livebootlegs der Band, welche die Zusammenstellung der Songs auf dieser Scheibe in den Schatten stellen. Musikalisch gesehen ist es halt NOFX, der geneigte Fan kennt eh schon alle Songs der Band, für die Neulinge ist es gefälliger melodischer Punkrock mit teilweise lustigen, teilweise politischen aber immer interessanten Texten. Die Band ist ja nicht umsonst schon seit einem Vierteljahrhundert zusammen... Fazit: Kann man als Fan kaufen, muss man aber nicht als ""Normalo"" in der Sammlung haben."
5,"JM gehört für mich zu den besten Blues-Gitarristen, seine muss man mögen (ich finde sie ok) aber der Typ ist der Hammer an der Gitarre.... 100 % Empfehlung"
2,"Ja, auch ich besitze alle Cure-Platten und rechne mich auch zu einem der ganz grossen Cure-Fans. Vom neuen Album bin ich leider - auch nach mehrmaligem Hören - sehr enttäuscht. Mit ""Underneath the stars"" fängt es dabei noch sehr vielversprechend an. Ansonsten hält es, was z.B. die ganz schwache Singleauskopplung ""Freakshow"" schon versprach. The Cure wirkten auf mich noch nie so ideenlos und langweilig. Die bombastischen Klangteppiche, welche Gänsehaut-Songs wie ""Plainsong"" oder ""Prayers for Rain"" ausmachen, fehlen gänzlich. Denke mal, es war keine gute Idee, auf Keyboards nun ganz zu verzichten, zumindst ein oder zwei songs im Stile von ""Apart"" oder ""Charlotte sometimes"" hätten dem Album zumindest etwas Abwechslung verliehen, so kommt es doch recht hölzern und sperrig daher. Beste songs des Albums sind die Singles ""The only One"" und ""Sleep when I'm dead"", sowie ""Underneath the Stars"". Dafür gibt es noch zwei Punkte. Der Rest : bestenfalls mauer Durchschnitt. Ab ins Regal zur Cure-Sammlung und auf das nächste Album warten und hoffen."
5,"Nach wie vor sind Europe eine meiner Lieblingsbands. Wenn man mal von dem Denken abkommt, man müsse jede Band, deren Mitglieder lange Haare haben, in die Heavy-Metal-Schublade stecken, und sich einfach nur auf die Musik konzentriert, wird man feststellen daß die Songs wirklich gelungen sind. Natürlich gibt es tausend Gerüchte, die einen sagen die Platte wäre schlecht, die andere finden sie toll - was soll das Gerede? Musik ist Geschmacksache, ""Out of this world"" bietet melodische Songs, die ich nicht unbedingt als Hardrock bezeichnen würde, die aber handgemacht sind. Ideal zum mitsingen und abhotten. Wem daran nichts liegt, der sollte halt lieber was anderes hören. Im Vergleich mit ""Final Countdown"" muß sich ""Out of this world"" keinesfalls verstecken. Auch wenn man nicht abstreiten kann, daß man auf den ersten Takt hört, daß es sich um eine Europe-Platte handelt, sind die Songs trotzdem eigenständig. Und wer sagt denn, daß es ein Nachteil ist, wenn man eine Band halt an der Stimme des Sängers sofort erkennen kann?"
4,"Ich finde die Cd gut, aber nicht so gut wie diverse Vorgänger. Dieter und seine Band werden ahlt auch älter und somit ruhiger.  Das fetzige und temporeiche fehlt einfach.  das letzte Lied-Popcorn-ist lustig gemacht, jeder kennt es.  Ansonsten sind auch einige unbekanntere Lieder dabei.  Vertreten sind unter anderem wieder Lieder von: Udo Jürgens, Howard Carpendale... Mir persönlich gefällt die letzte Cd einfach besser. Aber die Live-Cd ist ohnehin nicht zu toppen.  Ich hätte dieser Cd nur 3 Sterne gegeben, wäre nicht mein Lieblingslied vertreten: Liebe ohne Leiden. Einfach total schön. Auch ohne Frauenstimme. Udo Jürgens hat dieses Lied ja ursprünglich mit seiner Tochter gesungen damals. Für Fans ein Muss! Er spielt sehr viel von diesen neuen Liedern auf seinen Konzerten!"
1,"""....Dezember Nacht es ist kalt und Schnee bedeckt das Land, knisternde Spannung und Emotionen pur. Ein Album der besonderen Art...."" so schreibt es der Pressetext über das Weihnachtsalbum von Andrea Berg. Aha...also vielleicht hab ich etwas an den Ohren oder aber der Pressetext redet von einer CD, die mir nicht vorliegt. Mein Eindruck von ""Dezember Nacht""  ist eher folgender: ""Volkstrauertag,  nasskaltes November-Schmuddelwetter, gähnende Langeweile und Grauen pur."" Das Album hat in etwa die Spritzigkeit eines abgestandenen Glühweins (im Pappbecher), wäre es ein Weihnachtsbaum, er würde schon am ersten Adventssonntag nadeln. Die Lieder sind völlig belanglos arrangiert und produziert, meist recht langsam und sehr verhalten gesungen, zum Teil auch eher gehaucht. Das soll wohl emotional, knisternd spannend und latent erotisch klingen, hört sich aber leider an wie eine aus dem Schlaf geschreckte Telefonistin einer Erotik-Hotline. Zumindest hat es mit meiner Vorstellung von Weihnachten nichts zu tun. Das Problem an Frau Berg's Stimme ist leider, dass diese nur auf einem eher wuchtigen Playback gut klingt, vor einer akustischen Kulisse fällt sofort auf, dass ihr etwas Volumen fehlt. Die Eigenkompositionen klingen auch wieder wie ""Du hast mich tausendmal komponiert bzw. belogen"", hier in der Variation ohne Schlagzeug,  Bass und Groove. Ein Trauerspiel, so dass der Weihnachtsmann bestimmt ganz depressiv wird, aber vielleicht schenkt er ja dieses Jahr endlich ein paar neue Melodien und Akkorde. Kurzum: Man sollte sich als Fan diese CD getrost sparen, das Geld spenden, davon Süßigkeiten kaufen oder unter der Höhensonne etwas Licht tanken. Das macht allesamt glücklicher als dieses wirklich gänzlich unfestlich klingende Sammelsurium an Weihnachtsmelodien. Ich hab mich wirklich über den Kauf geärgert und kann dieses Album niemandem empfehlen. Das ist eher was für den Totensonntag samt Tanzverbot, aber weder weihnachtlich, noch besinnlich und erst recht nicht festlich."
5,"Als die Aufnahme 2004 auf den Markt kam, wurde sie sehr freundlich, ja begeistert aufgenommen. ""Thirteen of Handel's Italian operas are represented in this wonderfully enjoyable collection of duets, in which the bright, incisive soprano of Patrizia Ciofi is beautifully enmeshed with the plushier mezzo of Joyce Di Donato."" schrieb der Guardian. Aus dreizehn Opern sind hier Duette zusammengestellt. ""Beide Sängerinnen bringen ausdrucksstarke, unverwechselbare Stimmen mit. Ciofis Sopran ist hell timbriert, beweglich und hat eine strahlende Höhe, die sie mit Leichtigkeit erklimmt. Joyce Di Donatos Mezzosopran hingegen hat eine angenehme Wärme, eine vollklingende Resonanz mit deutlicher Artikulation und harmoniert vortrefflich mit der leichteren Stimme Ciofis. Das Zusammenspiel beider ist äußerst gelungen, voller Ausdruck, stilistisch stets sicher und variabel. Gesangstechnisch sind beide so selbstverständlich auf höchstem Niveau, dass man diese CD einigen ihrer Kolleginnen als Hörbeispiel geben sollt"" meinte Uwe Schneider. Duette hatten für den Hörer einen besonderen Reiz.""Die Faszination, die sich aus vokalen Engführungen, aus Terz- und Sext-Parallelen, aber auch aus der Reibung von Harmonien, aus unisono-Gesang oder dem Ineinander-Greifen der Stimmen, gewinnen lassen, stehen virtuosem Gesang keineswegs im Wege - im Gegenteil!"" Der Zusammenklang der Stimmen hat einen eigenen Reiz, der den Genuss einer Parallelführung ergeben natürlich Genüsse, die eine einzelne Stimme nicht produzieren kann. Beide Sängerinnen, damals am Anfang ihrer Karriere, ergänzten sich zu einem gemeinsamen Sängerinnen-Fest. Im ""Gedenkjahr"" eine weitere CD, die man unbedingt empfehlen. Eine, die den Reichtum Händelschen Erfindungsreichtum auf das Schönste dokumentiert."
5,"diese scheibe war vor beinahe einem viertel jahrhundert der erste musik-longplayer den ich mein eigen nennen durfe. ich bekam diese 13 aussergewöhnlichen tracks auf eigenen wunsch zu meinem 13. geburtstag geschenkt. irgendwann wich das vinyl oder die x-te überspielung auf kassette der cd - die mittlerweile als aac auf meinem iPod schlummert. so manch kritischer text von diesem album wurde von den politischen entwicklungen überholt. doch genau, wie die musik die technuischen entwicklungen überdauerte sind all die kritischen themen auch heute nicht wirklich schnee von gestern."
1,"So ein schlechtes Lied habe ich schon lang nicht mehr gehört. Jan Delay ist ja eigentlich echt krass drauf. ""Klar"" war ein richtig guter Comeback-Song. Auch sein letzter ""Feuer"" war echt gut. Doch das ist mehr als schrecklich. Den Gesang hört man so gut wie gar nicht, zumindest versteht man es nicht richtig. Die Melodie passt überhaupt nicht zum Text und zu seiner Stimme. Udo Lindenberg als Duettpartner auszuwählen finde ich auch wirklich schlecht. Sorry, Jan Delay, aber das ist wirklich unter aller Sau!"
2,"Der Schuh, den sich Jan Delay hier angezogen hat, passt hinten und vorne nicht. Der Groove hinkt und der Flow stolpert. Jan zieh bitte den Anzug wieder aus und nimm dir wieder deine Air Max. Die stehen dir besser zu Gesicht. Und lebende Tote wie Herrn Lindenberg der Credibility wegen wieder auszugraben nervt einfach nur. ""Mercedes Dance"" hat soviel Soul wie eben jene PKW-Marke. Trotzdem gibts zwei Punkte für die Lyrics, die mir z.B. bei ""Kartoffeln"" oder ""Ahn ich gar nicht"", mal wieder 100%ig aus der Seele sprechen."
2,"Ein ausgesprochen gewagter Crossover! Auf seine Weise sicherlich gut gemacht halten die Cover Versionen aber leider in keinem einzigen Stück trotz Reagge-Dub den charakteristischen Rhytmus durch, die Soli entfallen ebenfalls... Aus guten Grunde kann man die existierenden Cover Versionen von Pink Floyd Stücken an einer Hand abzählen. Dub Side ist definitiv eher etwas für Reagge- als für Pink Floyd Fans!"
5,"Seit wochen, nein Monaten suchten wir den Reiterhof teil 2. den ersten Teil hatten wir ja schon, nirgends, nirgends fanden wir ihn, aber auf Amazon. Echt klasse.  Hatte ich als Kind auf mc, schön, das es meiner Tochter auch gefällt. 5 Sterne"
2,"Was erwartet man, wenn sich zwei Megastars, wie Barbra Streisand und Barry Gibb treffen? Natürlich ein Meisterwerk, wie einst ""Guilty"". Leider werden diese Erwartungen hier überhaupt nicht erfüllt. Die Qualität der Lieder liegt leider völlig unter dem Durchschnitt und sind absolut belanglos. Frei nach dem Motto: ""Ich bin schließlich Frau Streisand, die Fans werden es schon kaufen."" Als Songwriter, Produzent und Kopf der Bee Gees sollte Barry Gibb doch über genug Erfahrungen verfügen, um zu merken, dass dieses Album absolut überflüssig ist. Er hat doch auch schon häufiger Hits für andere Künstler, wie Dionne Warwick und Diana Ross, geschrieben. Nicht zu vergessen, das Mega-Mega-Mega-geniale Album ""Guilty"". Diese CD ist als Nachfolger des 80er Albums leider eine Blamage."
4,"Lange hat das neue Album auf sich warten lassen. Aber es hat sich gelohnt. Ein Mix aus Baladen, 80'er Jahre Sound und Hip-Hop, der zu einem flüssigen ganzen arrangiert ist, läd den Zuhörer ein, sich die ganze Scheibe an einem Stück anzuhören. Lediglich der Bonusremix von Loverboy fällt da leider in negativer Hinsicht aus der Reihe. Für Fans ein muß; wem es nicht gefällt ist auch kein Fan."
4,"Zwischen dem Debutalbum ""Enter"" und dem genialen ""Mother Earth"", welches 2003 auch in Deutschland als Special Version erschien, liegt dieses Mini-Album. Es enthält auch einen CD-ROM-Teil, der auf Windows-PCs läuft. Vorsicht beim Abspielen im CD-Player, Track 1 ist der Computertitel - da kommen im schlechtesten Falle boxenkillende Töne. Die Musik setzt mit „The Dance"" ein, einem Stück, das auch als Bonus-Live-Titel auf der deutschen „Mother Earth""-CD drauf ist. Die Live Version klingt besser, die Produktion des Originals ist nicht so toll. Damit meine ich freilich nur den Klang, das Stück selbst ist über jeden Zweifel erhaben. Auch wenn ich selbst einige Zeit brauchte, um mich da „einzuhören"", denke ich nun, dass dies eines der besten Stücke der Band ist. „Another Day"" drängt sich von der Melodie her nicht sonderlich auf. Nett, aber nicht sehr einprägsam und wieder ein Titel im verhaltenen Tempo. „The Ofter Half (Of Me)"" geht dann schon richtig zur Sache! Die Breaks und Soli gehen hier etwas in der doch zu breiigen Produktion unter. Insbesondere die männlichen Gothic-Gesangparts versinken im Klangbrei der anderen Instrumente. Der Remix von „Restless"" fällt etwas kurz aus und wird nach gut 3:30 Minuten einfach ausgeblendet. Das Piano klimpert mir hier zu ausdruckslos vor sich hin, da fehlt die Dynamik. Ein weiterer Remix - und zwar von „Candles &amp; Pearls of Light"" - beschließt das Minialbum. Es handelt sich um einen sehr ruhigen Titel mit Pianobegleitung über schwebenden Synthieklängen mit Männerchor im Hintergrund. Fazit: Nichts Halbes und nichts Ganzes, aber sicherlich nicht schlecht."
2,"Ich finde die CD nicht so toll... wurde mir empfohlen aber irgendwie finde ich van halen nich besonders abwechslungsreich: fast alles in dur, die stimme von dem sänger ist nur mit ohropax zu ertragen. das war garantiert meine erste und letzte vanhalen cd."
2,"sorry, aber ein anderes Praedikat als langweilig und belanglos kann ich leider nicht finden. Wirklich schade, aber ich kann dieser CD beim besten Willen nichts abgewinnen. Jeder, der bereits 'Alone with...' nicht ueberzeugt fand, sollte die Finger von dieser CD lassen!"
5,"Diese CD ist eine Auflage der LP, die ich schon seit dem erscheinen in meiner Sammlung habe und diese auch nicht mehr missen möchte. Auch die zweite CD ist sehr gut geworden. Schönen Dank an Aurora lacasa und Frank Schöbel."
5,"Auch ich bin mit dieser Musik großgeworden, allerdings noch zur Zeit der Schallplatte. Ich bin nun 22 und habe noch kein Weihnachtsfest ohne diese wunderschönen Lieder verbracht. Mir kommen jedesmal fast die Tränen weil ich jedesmal an meine schöne Kindheit erinnert werde. 5 Sterne, absolut verdient. Super süße Lieder, vor allem ""Hey du Weihnachtsmann"" und ""Weihnachten in Familie""....sooooo schööön."
5,"..randvoll mit tollen Titeln, jede Minute ein Genuß! Der Sommer kann kommen- das rote Pferd, Caramba? Ole!...viel Musik für wenig Geld."
5,wir waren mit der familie in diesen sommerferien auf fuerteventura im urlaub. an jedem abend gibt es dort die kinderdisco bei der alle songs dieser cd gespielt werden. so viel spaß hatten unsere beiden töchter schon lange nicht mehr.. ( gar nicht zu sprechen von den ganzen anderen kindern )super moderne songs für kiddies und eltern... wir mußten immer mitmachen. die cd haben wir uns dann erst einmal hier in deutschland zugelegt.... und seitdem kaum noch aus dem cd spieler gelegt... eine wunderbare erinnerung an einen wunderschönen urlaub !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! mehr davon !!!!
5,"Ich spreche und verstehe zwar kein Französisch, aber gerade dadurch kann ich mich gerade auf den Klang der Musik und der Arrangements konzentrieren. Und dieses Album lässt wirklich keine Wünsche offen. Zunächst hält man die Musik vielleicht für ein bißchen schwul. Aber bei genauerem Hinhören entdeckt man die Vielfalt der CD. ""Negatif"" bietet einem das ""Gauloise Gefühl"", die unbeschreibliche Leichtigkeit des Seins. Einfach in den Sonnenstuhl oder auf den Balkon legen und die Wolken über sich hinziehen lassen, den Duft der Luft genießen und den Klängen von Benjamin lauschen."
5,"Hier muss jedoch die zweite Silbe betont werden, der Rock. Denn auch wenn die Beatsteaks nach wie vor unverkennbar eine Punkband sind, ist diese Platte kein reiner Punk. Es lassen sich auch Einflüsse von AC/DC oder Black Sabbath erkennen, auch wenn diese natürlich nicht tonangebend sind. Die rohe und gänzlich unpolierte Produktion tut ein übriges, um klarzumachen, dass sich die Beatsteaks von allen anderen Punkbands abheben. Sie spielen keinen Pop-Punk mit netten Melodien, was allerdings nicht heißen soll, dass sie keinen Sinn für Melodien hätten. ""Let Me In"" hat z.B. eine Melodie, die sich sofort im Ohr festsetzt und dort lange hängen bleibt. Aber ihre Songs sind eben nicht Pop im Gitarrengewand, sondern echte Gitarrensongs. Laut, dreckig und hart. Dabei haben die Beatsteaks ein besonderes Gespür für Rythmen und Breaks, was sich vor allem im bereits erwähnten ""Let Me In"" und auch bei ""A-Way"" zeigt. Der beste Song des Albums ist jedoch ""To Be Strong"", ein straighter (Punk-)Rocker mit toller Melodie, kurz und prägnant. Abgeschlossen (oder auch nicht) wird das Album von ""Summer"", dem Stück, das wahrscheinlich am deutlichsten vom Hardrock beeinflusst wurde. Und es ist ein mehr als gelungener Abschluss: Eine tolle Melodie, ein Refrain, den man fast schon mitsingen (bzw. gröhlen) muss und vor allem harte Gitarren. Selbst wenn man kein Fan von Punkrock ist, sollte man sich dieses Album anhören. Es lohnt sich!"
2,"Nach ihrem Debütalbum 2006 (Inside in/Inside out) gehörten die Kooks bis zu dem Zeitpunkt eines gewissen ""Satthörens"" zu den Platten, die zur Unterlegung verschiedenstartiger Launen immer wieder in den Player wanderten und auch danach nie in der untersten Schublade verschwanden. Sie mauserten sich zu einem wirklichen Beachtungserfolg, unterstrichen durch 1,5 Mio. verkauften Platten. Das Album ""Konk"", die LP im einzelnen: Ein Opener (""See the sun""), gefällig. Ein zweites Stück, die Auskopplung, (""Always where I need to be"") das irgendwie in Ordnung geht; Man darf weiterhören. ""Mr. Maker"", das bekannt vorkommt. Ein triefend zäher und dabei komplett unspannender viertel Titel (""Do you wanna"", Gab's den Titel nicht schon mal?), gefolgt von ""Gap"", das irgendwie nett ist. Zerstört von schellendem ""No need for excuses"" in ""Love it all"" - grausig unkreativ und musikalisch öde. ""Stormy weather"" bittet schon beinahe selbst um Nichtbeachtung: ""It fells like love, love, love / It feels like touch, touch, touch. / What did I say / What did I say / What did I say / Oh I didn't mean it. / Oh I didn't mean it"". Der Sinn von ""Sway"" bleibt mir verschlossen. Echte Hightlights fehlen und kommen nicht.  Für mich sind The Kooks irgendwie trashig, lässig, lassen's mal richtig krachen und sind gelegentlich echt lustig. Leider nur im ersten Album. Nach ""Shine on"" rettet auch ""Down to the market"" nichts mehr. Die zackigen Gitarrenriffs und die mal verdammt lässige, mal gehässig aufgedrehte Stimme von Luke Pritchard verlaufen sich durchgehend in der Mittelmäßigkeit und die Mittelmäßigkeit ist ein Attribut, das man keiner Gruppierung wünscht, die doch so erfolgreich mit der Brit-Welle der vergangenen Jahre zu uns getragen wurde. Jetzt höre ich eine Runde ""See the world"" und freue mich an ""Naive"". Vielleicht gibt es irgendwann einmal einen reiferen, zerstörteren oder ganz anderen dritten Versuch, der ihrem Namen wieder Sinn gibt. Ich schmolle erst einmal."
4,"Wenn man sich mindestens 30mal hintereinander Sgt. Pepper anhört, nebenbei den Zauberer von Oz anschaut und sich dabei noch ordentlich einen auf die Lampe gießt, kommt vermutlich genau die Art von Musik dabei heraus, die Panic At The Disco gerade machen. Ohne Ausrufezeichen im Namen kommen die Jungs aus Las Vegas nicht mehr ganz so hemdsärmelig und gitarrenlastig daher, wie auf dem Erstling ""A fever you can't sweat out"". Das wird bei der schnell angewachsenen Fangemeinde nicht unbedingt für frenetischen Beifall sorgen, hat aber gehöriges Potential, neue Liebhaber zu generieren. Zumindest solche, die sich zu amüsieren verstehen, denn das kann man auf ""Pretty Odd"" geradezu königlich.  Die Jugend besitzt das Privileg, sich alles erlauben zu können. Panic At The Disco nehmen das wörtlich und wildern mit untrüglichem Gespür für Harmonien in den Stilen und zwischen einer Menge Stühlen. ""Don't worry, we're still the same band"" heißt es zwar gleich zur Eröffnung, aber spätestens beim Schunkler ""Folkin around"" und der anschließenden Märchenonkel-Serenade ""She had the World"" ist man gewiss, dass dieser Band nichts ferner liegt, als Durchgängigkeit. An der einen oder anderen Stelle mag das allzu sehr verkünstelt klingen, aber Spaß macht die ganze Geschichte auf jeden Fall und dazu kann ""Pretty Odd"" mit einigen wunderbaren Melodien aufwarten. In ""Northern Downpour"" etwa, das auch von Travis kommen könnte, wenn Travis eine lustige Band wären. Oder in ""When the day met the night"", das mit Pauken und Trompeten den Beach Boys aus dem Kreuz geleiert wurde und sich nicht zu schade ist, beschwingte Belanglosigkeiten zu zitieren. In the middle of summer / All was golden in the sky / all was golden when the day met the night. Panic At The Disco haben zweifelsohne einen ganz gehörigen Dachschaden, aber ein bisschen Wahnsinn hat noch keiner Platte geschadet. Auch wenn sich die Sonne momentan noch selten blicken lässt, wird Pretty Odd wohl eines der sommerlichsten Alben dieses Jahres sein. Bitte vermeiden, wenn man es gerade vorzieht, richtig mies gelaunt zu sein. Alle anderen mitsingen."
1,"Nachdem wehleidigen Album Mensch, auf dem nur sehr wenige gute Titel waren, hatte ich mich endlich mal wieder auf ein richtig gutes Grönemeyer Album gefreut. Leider bin ich auch diesmal enttäuscht worden. So wird diese Scheibe im CD Regal den Platz neben den anderen 11 CDs von Herbert einnehmen und dort verstauben. Ich denke dass ich lieber 10x ""Chaos"", ""Luxus"", ""Bleibt Alles Anders"" oder einen der alten richtigen Klassiker (""Bochum"", ""Ö"") auflege. Irgendwie zündet die Scheibe nicht richtig und das obwohl ich sie heute Nachmittag 4x durchgehört habe. Lied 2 z. B. klingt wie billiger New Wave Synthie Pop aus den tiefen 80ern. Naja, der Erfolg den diese Scheibe haben wird ist ohnehin sicher gestellt. Ich denke mal, dass es genug Menschen gibt die sich die neue Grönemeyer blind kaufen (wie ich übrigens ja auch). Schade Herbert, da war mehr drin!!"
1,"Als Musikliebhaber, der die Band EAGLES ganz besonders gerne hört, bin ich sehr enttäuscht darüber, dass erst Anfang November das ""normale"" neue Album herauskommt und dann Ende November die ""Deluxe""-Version erscheint. In der Deluxe-Version sind ""nur"" zwei Lieder mehr darauf: HOLE IN THE WORLD (von gleichnamiger 2003er DVD-Single) und die Single-Neuerscheinung PLEASE COME HOME FOR CHRISTMAS. Es ist aber eine Gemeinheit gegenüber den Fans, dieses ""Deluxe"" hätten sie sich sparen können. Besser eine einzige Neuerscheinung inklusive dem ""40-seitigem"" Booklet, als die Fans in die erste Neuerscheinung investieren zu lassen und dann sie sich darüber ärgern zu lassen, dass es eine DELUXE-Version gibt. Hätte ich's gewusst, dass die DELUXE-Version herauskommt, dann hätte ich mir nicht die erste Version gekauft. Das ist Geldschneiderei von der Band, als wenn sie ihren Hals nicht voll genug bekommen würden. Ein enttäuschter EAGLES-Fan !!!!!!!!!!! -10 Punkte!!!!!!!!! Keep rockin' , Bernd."
2,"Ich bin sehr enttäuscht von der CD, da sie leider nur Einheitsbrei bietet und nie wirklich überrascht. Das ist Mainstream-Pop, aber nicht der neue Stern am Himmel der spanischen Musik. Die Stimme von Juanes ist schön aber die Stücke langweilen eher, als das sie unterhalten."
5,"Hoffmann gefällt und erfüllt locker alle Erwartungen. Er schafft es immer wieder einen mit seinen Liedern in andere Welten (auf andere Inseln)zu entführen oder mitzureissen. Es tut einfach gut seiner angenehmen Stimme zu lauschen. Auf ""Insellieder"" ist kein schwacher Song zu finden. Alle sind ruhig und warm vorgetragen, passend Intrumentiert und kein bisschen langweilig. Insellieder zeigt Hoffmann in Höchstform mit allen seinen Stärken: guter Text, super Refrain, starke Stimme, schöne Melodie und vieles mehr."
4,"Ich gebe dem Album 4 Sterne, weil es durch die Lyrics von 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks und Young Buck auf ganzer Ebene überzeugt, wobei man die Beats durch ihre Vielfalt und Eigenständigkeit zum Rest der Hip-Hop-Welt ebenfalls loben muss."
4,"The Game, wie er leibt und lebt, im Video und auf dem Cover jede Menge Leute, die mit N.W.A T-Shirts durch die Gegend rennen, Em hat sich nen Traum verwirklicht und seine Vorbilder wieder ins ""Game"" gebracht. Für kurze Dauer dürfte der Hipe anhalten und wieder alles verblassen. Trotz alldem immer noch eine gute Platte mit Höhen und Tiefen, vom kauf für ""Eminem""-Fans nicht zu beachten, jedoch, wer schon auf Dre alias ""Weed,Ice and Smoke"" standt, der wird sich auch dieses Album kaufen. Encore Fans wird es enttäuschen, gerade noch 4 Punkte."
1,"Also ich erwarte überhautp nichts von Ekos Album, sein letztes Mixtape war grauenhaft und ich war einer von den 2000 die sich das gekauft haben... Eko passt sich zu sehr Bushido an und ist eine 1:1 Kopie.. Werde mir das Album sicherlich anhören und falls es gut sein sollte dann hat Eko noch ne Chance im Deutschen Rap."
5,"Um es von Anfang an zu nennen! Ich halte im Großen und Ganzen nicht viel von Deutschem Hip Hop, außer Kool Savas, der zu den besten zählt. Denn durch das EKO, Sido und Fler gerappe vergeht einem die Lust sich mit dem Deutschsprachigem Hip Hop zubefassen. Doch nachdem ich den Emotional-Hochwertigen-Track ""Nie ein Rapper"" hörte und die Nachfolefeatures bei ""Nemesis"" auch genial fand. Musste ich mir es einfach kaufen und es war nicht nur sein geld wert sondern es zwingt einen auch sich mit der Materie zu befassen! Dieses Album ist der Hammer, Wahnsinn und einfach nur Weltklasse. Emotional auf aller höchsten Niveau und Rappteschnisch gar nicht weit von Kool Savas, also von der Deutschenrappelite, entfernt.  Anspieltipps: Gefangen, Um uns herum, Carlo Cokxxx Nutten Flavor                ect. Kaufen und Genießen!!! So etwas bekommt man nicht alle Tage!!!"
5,"Nach den beiden letzten Alben von The 69 Eyes, 'Angels' und 'Devils', hätte man die Finnen fast abschreiben können. Hochglanzpolierter Gothicmetalrock, recht durchschnittlich, ohne richtig viel Leben. Die Vampire aus Helsinki zehrten immer noch von dem grandiosen 'Blessed be' - Album, von diesem Album stammende Über-Hits wie 'Brandon Lee' sind bereits Klassiker des Genres. Danach hat die Band versucht, irgendwie etwas anderes zu machen um nicht als Selbstplagiat negativ aufzufallen und hat den Glam- und Lippenstiftfaktor fast selbstzerstörerisch erhöht.  Nun aber war offensichtlich Zeit für etwas Neues, also gingen die Helsinki Vampires nach Los Angeles, die Stadt der Engel. Dort wurde mit 'Back In Blood' das neue Werk eingezimmert - und der Erfolg könnte durchschlagender nicht sein. 'Back In Blood' ist nicht weniger als ein Meilenstein des modernen Gothic Hard Rock; sollte es eine solche Musikrichtung noch nicht geben, müßte sie für dieses Album erfunden werden.  Dabei geht die Band weiter in der eigenen Geschichte zurück, als es die meisten Fans der vermeintlich ersten 'Blessed Be' - Stunde verstehen werden. Denn The 69 Eyes haben mal als Hard Rock - Band angefangen, bevor die Dunkelheit ausbrach. Wer es nicht glaubt, möge sich 'Wrap Your Troubles In Dreams' zu Gemüte führen.  Auf diesem Weg zurück verweilen The 69 Eyes aber ausgiebig auf der Höhe von 'Blessed Be'. Und so ist 'Back In Blood' ein Album, das den Hardrock ganz früher Tage mit dem Gothic Metal der nicht ganz so frühen Tage verbindet.  Dabei achtet die Band darauf, die einzelnen Stücke nicht zu überladen. Jeder Song ist unverkennbar The 69 Eyes, aber mal Rock ('Dead Girls Are Easy' - was für ein sensationeller Rausschmeißer!) mal Gothic Metal (Songs wie 'Night Watch', 'Lips Of Blood' oder 'Eternal' wären auch auf 'Blessed Be' absolute Highlights).  Die Produktion von Matt Hyde (immerhin Grammy-Gewinner) ist sensationell hart, gleichzeitig weich und melancholisch, bis ins kleinste Detail ECHT, nichts wirkt künstlich, glattpoliert oder überladen. Ein Meisterwerk an Klang, das den Hörer sofort wie in einem Sog mitwirbelt, man hat das Gefühl, die Band stünde direkt vor einem, während man das Album hört. Vergleiche mit einem Klassiker wie 'Appetite For Destruction' von Guns n' Roses sind nicht zu weit hergeholt, auch wenn The 69 Eyes natürlich auch und insbesondere wegen Jyrkis Stimme weitaus düsterer zugange sind. 'Dead Girls Are Easy' ist ein Rocker der Güteklasse 'Paradise City'.  'All I Wanted To Do is.... ROCK!!'  Na das ist mal ne Ansage, und die 69 Eyes kommen dem 12 Songs lang nach.  Mit 'Eternal' ist auch die beste Ballade der Bandgeschichte am Start. The 69 Eyes schaffen es, düster-erotischen Gesang, Pathos, Kitsch, Zuckerguß und brettharte Gitarren perfekt zu kombinieren. Dieses Album lebt, atmet, blutet Herzblut, von untot keine Spur, außer in den Texten, die sich um die Herrschaften mit den spitzen Zähnen drehen.  The 69 Eyes waren genau zur rechten Zeit am rechten Ort, haben sich mit 'Back in Blood' neu erfunden.  Natürlich braucht man auf dem Weg zur Erleuchtung etwas Hilfe, und so durften sich die Norweger auch auf Matt Hyde (Produktion - unter anderem auch Slayer oder Monster Magnet), den berühmten Künstler und Fotografen Estevan Oriol, sowie den durchgeknallten, allseits bekannten Bam Margera (Video-Regie) verlassen, die ihnen gemeinsam den Weg ermöglichten.  Den Weg allerdings gehen, das mußte die Band selbst, und das hat sie mit solcher Bravour getan, dass selbst alteingesessene Rezensenten noch ins Staunen geraten.  01. Back In Blood  02. We Own The Night  03. Dead NŽ Gone  04. The Good, The Bad &amp; The Undead  05. Kiss Me Undead  06. Lips Of Blood  07. Dead Girls Are Easy  08. Night Watch  09. Some Kind Of Magick  10. Hunger  11. Suspiria Snow White  12. Eternal"
1,"Eko war mal ein kleiner Rapper an der Seite von Kool Savas. Beide waren dicke Freunde und wollten ""was ganz Großes"" aufbauen. Eko hat dies auch geschafft, wobei die Bezeichnung ""großer Sch**ßhaufen"" es wohl am ehesten trifft. Eko's Style reicht vllt für Gastauftritte, weil es mal was anderes ist, aber ansonsten geht einem der Typ nach 5 Minuten bereits voll auf den S**k. Eko zieht gerne Wörter sehr sehr lang (""DeutschlaaÄÄAaaand""), damit sich in seinen (schlechten) Texten überhaupt was reimt. Das ist ne nette Idee, hört sich aber in der Praxis grottig an und nervt, wie schon gesagt, bodenlos. Seine neuesten Gefühlsausbrüche wie ""L.O.V.E""(Life of Valezka and EKO aka Love=Liebe ;) ) zeugen nun auch noch von Ideenlosigkeit und leider leider klingt das ganze auch noch ziemlich schwul. Lieber EKO, ich mochte dich mal richtig gern, aber seitdem du nicht mehr mit KKS zusammen bist (der dir anscheinend viel geholfen hat oder dich erst dazu getrieben hat, was du heute machst) ist deine Musik einfach nur noch Bulls***. Bitte hör auf, du könntest vllt mei DSDS als Juror oder so auftreten, um deine Brötchen zu verdienen. Zu den einzelnen Tracks des Albums will ich nichts weiter sagen, ich habe sie alle einmal gehört und ein zweites Mal bringe ich es nicht ohne gesundheitliche Beeinträchtigungen übers Herz. Eko nimm es mir nicht übel, ÄNDER einfach deinen Style und du wirst vllt noch Erfolg haben."
5,"Bin ein Dubblestandart Fan der ersten Stunde und lasse kein Konzert aus wenn in Wien oder Wiesen gespielt wird. Für mich eine der besten Scheiben von Dubblestandart. Mein absoluter Favorit ist Heavy Heavy Monster Dub-Dreadzone RMX. Diese Nummer kommt so gut (speziell beim Gleiten so mit 160 Sachen auf der Autobahn), die könnte ich endlos hören. Paul am Bass rulez. Georg"
1,"eigentlich war ich sehr sicher mir dieses Album zu holen,da die erste Singleauskopplung ""She wants to move"" einfach spitze ist.Doch gerade habe ich mir die Lieder alle im Laden mal angehört und bin mächtig enttäuscht.Die Lieder klingen zum Teil richtig lahm &amp; langweilig,außer halt ""she wants to move"".Da waren meine Erwartungen wohl zu gross.Ich würde allen Kaufinteressierten empfehlen sich das Album vorab anzuhören,bevor sie es sich zu legen wollen."
5,"Alles in allem eine sehr gute house compilation. Nachdem mir viele der andere ministry of sound cds nicht so sehr zusagen, hat mich clubber's guide 2008 wirklich positiv überrascht.  -Sehr gute Liedauswahl, vor allem nicht so ""kommerzig"" wie die UK Edition. Mit 2,3 Ausnahmen gibt es wirklich ""neue"" Lieder oder zumindest Versionen.  -Die Übergänge sind fast ausschließlich gut gemixt Fazit: Absolut zu empfehlen."
5,"Nach der guten Resonanz, die der Vorgänger dieses Blue Note Trips - ""Saturday Night"" bekommen hat, geht das Label (wiederum mit DJ Maestro, der erfolgreich Blue Note Abende gibt) in die zweite Runde. Wiederum ist die CD zweigeteilt in einen clubbigen Part und eine ruhigere Zone."
5,"Bestes Album des Jahres 1994 (jedenfalls für mich). Während Warren G in L.A. die G-Funk era einläutet, ""put'en"" OutKast Atlanta ""on the map"". Innovativ und völlig anders als andere Hip-Hop-Acts waren sie schon damals ... dieses Debut-Album kommt allerdings etwas ""gangstermäßiger"" rüber als die späteren Werke. Feinste Funk- und WAHWAH-Klänge finden sich im Titelsong , in ""Players Ball""(für mich der no.1 Track), und in ""Funky Ride"". Die Instrumente sind tatsächlich eingespielt und nicht bloß gesampelt! Unbedingt reinhören ... oder gleich kaufen. Lay back and enjoy ... da geht einiges."
5,"fünf lange jahre warten haben sich ausezahlt. jill hat mit ihrem zweiten studioalbum einen weiteren wurf gelandet. die scheibe reiht sich ohne geholpere an ihre beiden grossartigen vorgängeralben an. werde nicht lange auf einzelne titel eingehen, dafür würde der platz nicht ausreichen. neben den gewohnten tiefgängigen und aussagekräfitgen soulstücken, sind mit ""golden"" und ""family reunion"" auch super- tanzbare stücke auf der platte zu finden. jetzt kann der herbst kommen, denn eine bessere heizung wie diese scheibe gibts nicht... kaufen und geniessen!"
1,"Der beste Tag seines Lebens?Klar,sein Album kommt heute raus und er verdient endlich ne Menge langerwarteter Kohle.Aber Savas zeigt das er nicht das ist,was er lange Zeit angegeben hat zu sein;nämlich Untergrund.Bekannt durch ""LMS"" und ""Pimplegionär"" ,aber niemand fragt sich:Wie kann jemand solche Texte schreiben,wenn er schon seit zig Jahren mit Mel zusammen ist?Ist das true?Von den 12 Tracks sind 3 Skits(bzw.Intro)die glaub ich nur Savas selbst versteht.Die langerwartete LP hat also nur 9 richtige Tracks.Die feat. mit den Amis haben mich nicht wirkilch überzeugt,die Tracks 2,6(mit Azad)und 12 sind fett,doch Savas hatte für mich seinen Höhepunkt mit Haus&amp;Boot und That Smut.Insgesamt bin ich von ihm enttäuscht dehalb nur 1 Stern.Er hat sich weiterentwickelt(Rap&amp;Beatz)doch mein Ding ist es nicht.Leiht euch das Teil von eurem kleinen Bruder;ein Kauf lohnt nicht(genauso wie beim Optik-Tape,was ja der totale Abzug ist(kein einziger neuer Track)) Wer richtigen Berliner Rap hören will,sollte sich Beatfabrik!!!, Romanzn,Diablow,Illuminaten oder BattleRapp reinziehen."
2,"Ich dachte nach den anderen uns allen bekannten Sängerinnen haben wir endlich mal ruhe...nein, so wars dann leider doch nicht. Ein paar lieder wie z.B. Go back sind schon ganz gut und sind ja eigentlich Ohrwurmtauglich, aber bitt warum muss das immer den anderen drei ( Brit, Chris und Jess ) nachgeeifert sein? Man hat sowas schon zig mal gehört, ich versteh nicht warum man immer nur auf das Geld aus ist, gibt es denn keine Ehrlichkeit, bzw eigenes Potential mehr? Gut die Stimme is echt nicht schlecht, das geb ich zu, aber was sie daraus macht ist leider Mangelware, das sie trotzdem Erfolg hat, zeigt das es trotzdem noch genügend Menschen gibt denen es gefällt CDs mal einfach so zu kaufen, ein paar mal anhört und dann nach nem halben Jahr sagt: "" Das ist alt, das brauch ich net mehr, gibt ja schon ein neues Album "" . Aber da es diese Menschen in der großen Anzahl gibt, verkauft es sich auch so gut."
1,"Oh mein Gott. So und nicht anders stelle ich mir das jüngste Gericht vor. Ich armer kleiner Sünder vor dem Erzengel und der schmettert dann auf einmal ""mein Elternhaus"". Aaaarrghhhhh! Zum Glück nur ein Alptraum, der aber bedrohlich ernst wird, wenn ich die Gesichter der beiden ""Interpreten"" ständig in der Werbung zu sehen bekomme.  Manche Sachen sind so schlecht, dass sie schon wieder gut sind. Die Amigos bilden da eine ganz neue Kategorie. Begriffe wie ""unterste Schublade"" verbieten sich, weil dann alle anderen Schubladen auf einmal Beine bekommen und fluchtartig das Weite suchen. Bei solch einem nicht einmal mehr volkstümlich zu nennenden Grauen erwacht selbst Ötzi wieder zum Leben, nur um drei Sekunden später zum Strick zu greifen.  Die mit ABSTAND schlechteste Musik, die mir jemals zu Ohren kam."
5,"blaue Flecken. Das ist die mittlerweile 3te Singleauskopplung des Nr. 1 Albums ""Die Suche Geht Weiter"". Fans kenne den Song bereits von den Konzerten. Ich muss gestehen das ich den Song an Anfang doof fand. Doch als ich die ersten Remixe hörte und das Album immer und immer wieder lief wurde der Song schnell zu einen meiner Lieblingssongs auf der Platte. Ein fröhlicher Popsong der sich bestimmt den Weg in die Charts bahnen wird. Wer Rosenstolz kennt weiß das sich die beiden sympatischen Berliner immer was neues einfallen lassen für ihre Singles. So gibt es auf dieser Singlerversion gleich 2 Bonustracks und gleichzeitig auch noch eine Premiere. Zum ersten mal singt Peter eine sogenannte B-Seite auf einer Single. ""Susi im Roten Kleid"" ist so schön. Leider habe ich den anderen Bonussong ""Alles Ist Erleuchtet"" noch nicht gehört, aber wie schon erwähnt soll es die Single in mehreren Versionen geben. Darunter eine Remix CD voll mit coolen Dancetracks. Also ich werde mir die Single holen. Schon allein wegen des Bonustracks den Peter singt. Freu mich auch schon auf die Tour DVD. Macht bloß weiter so und hört nie wieder auf so schöne Songs zu schreiben."
1,"Bei Rainhard Fendrich vermisse ich die Emotion der älteren Alben. Bei ""Brüder"" dachte ich, das sei sein schlechtestes Album, es kann nur mehr aufwärts gehen. Wenigstens war da der Titelsong gut. Aber diesmal hat er sich an Einfallslosigkeit selbst übertroffen. Das ganze klingt nicht annähernd nachdem, was ich mit dem Wort ""Aufleben"" verbinde. Für die letzten beiden Alben ""Blond"" und ""Männersache"" hat sich der Liedermacher jeweils vier Jahre Zeit genommen und die sind durchwegs gelungen. Aber hier: kein Song vermag es mitzureissen. Es klingt alles aufgesetzt. Ähnlich wie Schlager (zudem auch fast alles hochdeutsch gesungen ist). 13 Songs, kein einziger klingt annähernd hitverdächtig."
5,"maestro passaro hats geschafft :-)  amore per sempre ist ein echter beweis,wie viel ihm die musik bedeutet.wer auf den text hört(und italienisch kann,oder die Übersetzung liest) merkt, dass das wirklich ein Song von Nevio ist...zu100%.da steckt sein herz drin.... es ist ein echt schönes lied, mirt schönem text^^ und einer schönen melodie...allerdings freu ich mich auf das folgende...er hat einfach noch paar spitzen songs auf lager,was man ja bei STELLA schon hören kann.... NEVIO siete il la cosa migliore! bacio,jana"
5,"Nightwish polarisierte schon mit dem Vorgängeralbum Century Child ihre Fans - mit ihrem neuesten Longplayer werden sie diese womöglich in zwei Lager spalten. In der Tat, der neue Stil den Maestro Tuomas Holopainen eingeschlagen hat ist für viele ein Schlag ins Gesicht: Viele der ""typischen"" Nightwish-Elemente weichen einem moderneren, fast progressiven Songwriting wie man es sonst vielleicht nur von Dream Theater gewohnt ist. (Wobei Tuomas DT ziemlich scheusslich findet =) ) Dazu kommt, dass Nightwish deutlicher denn je ihre harte Seite betonen: laute, düstere, schwere Gitarrengewitter dominieren die Songs. Außerdem versucht sich Marco im Shouting, und es fällt zum ersten Mal das legendäre Rock-""Ungh!"" (Track 8 - Romanticide) Da sind wir auch schon bei dem Thema Nummer 1: Marco singt deutlich mehr, was vielen Fans missfallen dürfte. Tarja zeigt zwar mal wieder wie vielseitig und wunderschön sie singen kann, allerdings hat sie im Mix häufig eine etwas zu dünne Präsenz - etwas was viele schon an Century Child gestört hat. Ein Pluspunkt dürfte allerdings einstimmig die ausgefallenen Orchester-Arrangements sein, die viel mehr Präsenz bekommen haben. Ich persönlich finde, dass Nightwish mit ""Once"" ihr substanzvollstes und reifstes Werk aller Zeiten geschrieben haben. Bestimmt werden viele protestieren, aber die Komplexität der Lieder kann meiner Ansicht nach mit denen von Tool (und das mag was heißen) mithalten. Kein leicht verdauliches Material, sondern eher die Art Musik, die man sich mehrmals durchhören muss um sie zu ""verstehen"", sie richtig zu ""fühlen"". Die einzige berechtigte Kritik ist, dass dem Album gewissermaßen ein roter Faden fehlt."
1,"Ich bin von Avantasia - Lost in Space total enttäuscht. Ich liebe The Metal Opera Part I und II und habe mich schon lange auf die Fortsetzung gefreut. Breits beim ersten einlegen in den Cd- Player hat man das Gefühl als höre man einen (mal eben) runtergeschriebenen POP-Song. Und auch die weiteren Songs auf der EP haben nicht auch nur den Hauch der POMPÖSEN Vorgänger.""The Story Aint over"" erinnert zwar etwas an Passagen aus dem Titelsong von Part II und wirkt etwas ""liebevoller"" geschrieben, aber dennoch finde ich im Vergleich zu den Vorgängern ist EIN guter Song auf der EP einfach zu wenig. Die weiteren Songs wirken wie langweilig geratene B-Seiten um ein wenig Reibach zu machen. Naja...ich hoffe das Album wird besser! ROCK ON!"
4,"Das Album ist eigentlich ganz gut aber auf jeden Fall schlechter als die Alben ""Slipknot und ""Iowa""! Man merkt das sich Slipknot weiterentwickelt hat und nicht mehr so hart sind wie auf ""Slipknot oder Iowa""! Es sind hier auch sehr gute Tracks drauf wie z.b ""Duality , Before i forget und The Nameless"" aber es sind hier auch ein paar schlechte Tracks drauf! Fazit: Also ich kann euch das Album nur empfehlen!"
2,"Kurz zusammengefasst würde ich sagen, ich habe noch nie so gut gemachte Langeweile gehört. Max und seine Mannen haben hier ein Album gemacht, dass für mich wie ein Follow-up zu Sepultura's ""Roots"" klingt - das gleiche, schon fad werdende Gitarrenriff, derselbe, vertraute Beat. Meiner Meinung nach schlachten Soulfly die letzten Überbleibsel von Sepultura aus, ohne wirklich an einer Weiterentwicklung oder an einem eigenständigen, neuen Stil zu arbeiten. Klar - wenn ich die CD für sich selbst stehen lasse und die Vorgeschichte der Band ausser Acht lasse, dann ist das vorliegende Werk durchaus gut. Meiner Meinung nach muß man aber die Historie der Band und die anderen Alben kritisch miteinbeziehen - und dann hat sich ""Primitive"" nicht mehr als 2 Sterne verdient."
2,"Der Titel ""All hope is gone"" passt sehr gut...  Wir geben die Hoffnung auf, das Slipknot sich selber treu bleiben:  Die bisherigen Alben, aber insbesondere die älteren Scheiben sind herrlich unkommerziell und man hatte den Eindruck gewonnen, das diese Gruppe einen Kontrapunkt zu dem Majorlable-Buisness setzen, bzw. einen alternativen Weg im Musikgeschäft gehen.  Schon beim Vorgänger ""Vol.3: (the Subliminal Verses)"" hatte ich dann das Gefühl, das es kommerzieller wird.  Mit ""All hope is gone"" wird mein Gefühl bestätigt. Man hat zwar den typischen Slipknot-Sound weitestgehend erhalten, aber die Musik ist eingängiger/melodiöser.  Wenn man den Markt der 9 bis 15 jährigen abgreifen will, ist das wohl unvermeidlich. Auch der Auftritt bei den ""MTV Music-Video Awards"" (!!!) bestätigt meine Annahme. Aber nicht nur das sie dort waren, zudem lassen sich die Jungs allen ernstes auf ""Modegespräche"" ein:  ""Das sind aber tolle Masken! Eititei. Macht ihr die selber, oder wer hat die designt?"" Spätestens ab diesem Punkt ist die Glaubwürdigkeit von Slipknot für mich dahin gewesen.  Wer den typischen Slipknot-Sound mag, aber trotzdem Melodien, die an Kinderlieder erinnern, mitgröhlen will liegt mit diesem Album richtig.  Ich persönlich bleibe dann doch bei den alten Scheiben. Danke."
5,"Florez zählt wohl zu den größten Sängern unserer Zeit, hohe Musikalität und Ausdruckskunst, die hohen Töne erscheinen mühelos mit herrlichem Timbre. Das Duett aus Puritani mit Anna Netrebko ein Highlight!"
1,"Die kommerzielle Verwertbarkeit der abendländischen Kultur ist einziger Parameter für diese schreckliche, peinliche Produktion. ECM als EDITION for CASH MUSIC ist damit im Sumpf der kulturlosen Gegenwart angekommen. Dass das Hilliard Ensemble dieses üble Spiel mitmacht ist auf der ganzen Linie enttäuschend. Den neueren CDs hört man im übrigen sofort an, dass sie ihren stimmlichen Zenith überschritten haben. Geht es jetzt nur noch ums Absahnen?"
2,"Nachdem ich das letzte Album (The Boy With No Name) großartig fand, ist dieses so ganz anders. Vergangene Songs wie Quicksand, Love Will Come Through, Big Chair, Battleships oder My Eyes (um nur enige zu nennen) haben mich durch tolle Melodien, großen Tiefgang und melancholische Elemente beeindruckt. DAS war für mich Travis! Davon ist auf der aktuellen Scheibe leider nicht viel übrig geblieben. Die Band kommt rockiger und unkonventioneller daher. Eingängige Melodien findet man selten. Die Einschätzung von MTV - ihr neues Werk ist so was von Britpop, dass selbst Oasis hinten anstehen müssen"" - sagt eigentlich schon genug aus. Denn mit der genannten Band hatte die Musik, die Travis zuletzt prägte, recht wenig zu tun. Nur drei Highlights kann ich beim aktuellen Werk ausmachen: Quite Free, Song To Self und Before You Were Young. Der Rest ist für mich nicht erwähnenswert und bleibt alles andere als im Ohr. Das ein oder andere Stück hört sich für mein persönliches Empfinden wie ein unfertiger Demosong an, oder wie eine Aufnahme einer Jamsession. Hier zeigt sich vielleicht auch, dass das letzte Album erst ein gutes Jahr zurück liegt. Denn ich bin immer der Meinung, dass Gutes Zeit braucht.  Gegen Facettenreichtum ist nichts einzuwenden. Und echte Fans werden und dürfen auch diese CD lieben! Doch das Meine ist es nicht..."
2,"das ist nicht Mnozil Brass wie wir sie kennen und lieben. Auf dieser CD scheinen sie zeigen zu wollen was sie musikalisch draufhaben. Leider hat die CD eher einen einschläfernden Charakter und verkörpert meiner Meinung nach nicht Mnozil Brass. Wo bleiben die Gags, der Spielwitz, das herrlich Verrückte was sie bisher so besonders gemacht hat?! Wie gesagt vom künstlerischen Aspekt ist alles perfekt, aber das können leider auch andere...German Brass, Canadian Brass etc. Ein Tipp meinerseits: ""Schuster bleib bei deinen Leisten!"""
2,"Einmal ganz davon abgesehen, dass es sich bei der neuesten Live-Veröffentlichung der Doors nur um eine Zusammenstellung verschiedener Songs der damaligen Auftritte handelt, also das gesamte Material mit alternativen Versionen nicht dargeboten wird, handelt es sich hierbei vor allem aus qualitativer Hinsicht um eine Enttäuschung.  Selbstverständlich, eine Verbesserung des Sounds ist im Vergleich zu diversen Bootlegs der letzten Jahrzehnte deutlich hörbar. Dem Käufer wird jedoch vorenthalten, dass diese Aufnahmen in weit besserer Qualität existieren.  ZUR ERLÄUTERUNG : Was der Käufer hier angeboten bekommt, ist lediglich eine mehr oder minder gelungene Aufarbeitung von KOPIEN des Master-Tapes. Jenes ist im Besitz des einstigen Besitzer des Matrix-Clubs, Peter Abrams, welcher besagte Kopien vor etwa 40 Jahren an das Doors-Büro schickte um über einen eventuellen Deal zur gemeinsamen Veröffentlichung zu verhandeln. Das Master-Tape enthält alle Songs in makelloser Klang-Qualität. Kürzlich bereitgestellte Ausschnitte belegen die drastischen Unterschiede im Sound : Kein Rauschen, kein Echo und kein Zischen. FAKT IST : Ohne die Zustimmung von Abrams als Urheber der Aufnahmen bewegen sich die Doors mit diesem Release auf illegalem Terrain. Aus bisher unbekannten Gründen kam es aber nie zu einer Vereinbarung, Abrams wurde zu keiner Zeit kontaktiert und wird an keiner Stelle im Booklet der CD erwähnt oder kreditiert. Man verwendete stattdessen das Material, das eigentlich als Hörprobe gedacht war. FAZIT : Nicht nur Hardcore-Fans der Doors dürfen sich betrogen fühlen. Da die Auftritte im Matrix als die frühesten Live-Erzeugnisse der Doors gelten, die auf Band festgehalten wurden, und Morrisons Anwesenheit und Intensität hier spürbarer wird als je zuvor, hätte dieses Release alle vorherigen Live-Veröffentlichungen der Gruppe in den Schatten stellen können. Fraglich bleibt, warum die Doors nicht für die bestmögliche Qualität gesorgt haben, ob eine der legendärsten und erfolgreichsten Bands der Rockmusik finanzielle Einsparungen nötig hatte, deshalb nicht auf das Angebot von Abrams eingehen wollte und sich daher lieber an den Rand der Legalität gewagt hat. Wenn man bedenkt, dass Doors-Fans in aller Welt jahrelang ein offizielles Release des Materials ersehnt haben, ist dieser Pfusch schwer zu entschuldigen. Was bleibt ist die Hoffnung, dass wir irgendwann vielleicht doch noch die  gesamte Performance in all ihrer Klarheit und Reinheit zu hören bekommen, weil die Doors und alle Beteiligten die Empörung über diese Veröffentlichung, die vor allem in der Hardcore-Fan-Gemeinde deutlich spürbar ist, nicht einfach so an sich vorbeiziehen lassen."
2,"Immer wieder fallen unschuldige CD-Käufer auf Cephalgy rein. Die CD ist so ermüdend langweilig, alles klingt immer gleich, immer die gleichen Texte, immer die gleiche Leier. Während ""Finde deinen Dämon"" noch einen gewissen Charme hatte, ist weder der Vorgänger noch dieser Nachfolger hier ernsthaft irgendeiner Aufmerksamkeit wert. Der einzige Fortschritt der bei dieser Band von statten geht, ist die Qualität ihrer Artworks. Musikalisch ist Stillstand."
5,"endlich ist es da, das neue Blutengel - Album ^^ ich kann dieses Album wirklich einfach jedem Fan empfehlen, die Balladen sind einfach zum dahinschmelzen ^^ [Behind Your Mask &lt;333] Auch die Tanzbaren Nummern haben, wie immer, einen Ohrwurmcharacter. Schon nach einmaligem hören bekommt man sie einfach nichtmehr aus dem Kopf. Lieblingstracks: Behind Your Mask, Sunrise, Singing Dead Man, Engelsblut 5/5 - Das Warten hat sich gelohnt.."
1,"Den Lobeshymnen kann ich mich nun wirklich nicht anschliessen. Die alten Lacrimosa Platten fand ich wirklich gut, diese karg inszenierten Platten lassen einem die Gänsehaut über den Rücken fahren. Dann begann Lacrimosa mehr auf Melodie zu setzen - sicherlich nicht schlecht, man denke nur an das Album Inferno oder Stille. Aber was Lacrimosa dann taten, war keine Meisterleistung: sie entdeckten den totalen Bombast für sich. Erste Ausgeburt: Elodia, ein Tiefpunkt in Ihrer Karriere. Sehr gut liess sich das auf Konzerten beobachten: bei alten Sachen tolle Stimmung, bei den neuen nur noch gnädiger Beifall. Fassade, ging wieder in die richtige Richtung, ein bisschen mehr Rock und dafür weniger Klassik. Doch jetzt das: Echos. Das ist das schlechtesteste was ich die letzen 5 Jahre gehört habe. Es sollten sich bitte nur Leute an Klassik versuchen, die es können. Mit dem 12 - Min. Kyrie  fängt Echos an uns zu quälen, dabei ist das noch der beste Song auf dem Album. ""Kyrie"" möchte man auch Tilo Wolff zurufen. Aber schon geht es weiter mit ""Durch Nacht und Flut"". Kitschig, voller Pathos und irgendwie wird man bei der ganzen Platte das Gefühl nicht los, das alles schon mal gehört zu haben. Vermutlich auf Elodia. Eine musikalische Weiterentwicklung ist nicht mehr zu erkennen, Lacrimosa watschen im tiefen Sumpf der Mittelmässigkeit. Bezeichnend der Name des letzen Liedes: ""Die Schreie sind verstummt"". Ja, wenn die Platte vorbei, dann stimmt das. Den einen Punkt habe ich wegen Mitleid vergeben und wegen dem schön aufgemachten Digi-Pack mit einem wirklich gelungen Artwork. Macht sich zumindest ganz gut im Regal die Platte. Da wird sie auch noch lange', lange liegen."
1,"Beeindruckend wie Christian Pohl es immer wieder schafft seinem eigenen ""Talent"" angemessene Mitmusiker zu finden. Noch beeindruckender, dass die Vocals der Sängerinnen schiefer klingen als der Turm von Pisa aussieht. Das ist nicht erst seit heute ein Problem von Christian Pohl's Blutengel, dessen eigenes Gewimmer auch klingt wie ein halb verhungerter Zombie aus Resident Evil. Dennoch erstaunt es mich jedes Mal aufs neue, wie man bei den Aufnahmen sagen kann ""So klingt das gut, lassen wir so."". Ich hab selbst auf Rehearsals anderer Bands bessere Gesangsspuren gehört."
5,"Erstmal vorab: Ein Neal Morse braucht nach jahrelangem musikalischem Wirken nicht mehr Rechenschaft über seine Alben aufgrund mancher vernichtender Kritik ablegen. Vielmehr müssen seine Platten als Gesamtkomposition ausgemacht werden. Deswegen auch immer wieder auftauchende Motive in den Arrangements. Ich kenne Neal Morse`s musikalische Wege von Grund an auf und bin der Meinung, dass die Kritik für seine neue Platte ""Sola Scriptura"" viel zu negativ ausfällt. Natürlich sind seine Texte stark christlich gefärbt und versuchen seinen Glauben in die Welt zu tragen, jedoch kann man ihm dieses doch auch positiv auslegen. Ich bin gewiss auch kein Vorzeigechrist und stehe nicht hinter den Textaussagen, aber es zählt doch vielmehr, dass er mit seiner Musik die Menschen erreicht. Außerdem beschwert sich auch niemand über ""düster gefärbte"" Texte von Blackmetal oder Deathmetal Bands. Seine Songstrukturen wirken für mich, ebenfalls auch als großer Transatlantic und Spock`s Beard Fan,keinesfalls ""abgenudelt"". Die Songs sind halt schon immer stark motivisch arrangiert worden. Zudem tritt die, wie immer, hervorragende Arbeit der Gastmusiker zutage. Hervorheben möchte ich hier Mike Portnoy, der für jeden Schlagzeugfan immer noch das Non-Plus-Ultra darstellen dürfte. Ich kann jedem alten und neuen Fan von Neal Morse empfehlen diese Platte zu kaufen, denn sie ist ein weiterer Schritt zu Neal Morses musikalischem Gesamtwerk, dass wir ""Progfreunde"" zu würdigen wissen sollten. Deswegen: Weitermachen Neal!!!"
1,"Wer auf Jumpstyle steht wird diese CD mögen. Ich hasse es. Auf beiden CDs ist ein Song empfehlenswert und zwar der allerletzte auf der 2.CD. Wie auch schon mein Vorredner schrieb, muss ich fragen wo das Feeling von Hardbass 1 oder 2 geblieben ist. Wo ist z.B. Omega Nine geblieben? Die waren für mich einer der besten."
1,"Habe mir mit voller Erwartung das best of teil 1 gekauft. Aber man, da sind ja alle Songs drauf die schon ewige Zeiten veröffentlicht sind. Ein Best of sind doch ""Hits"" die man auf eine CD packt. Aber wo sind die Hits ausser vielleicht ""Sie liebt den DJ"" die auch schon ewige Zeit alt ist. Naja. Mit Schrecken habe ich dann auch noch heute den Artikel in der Bild Zeitung Ausgabe Ruhrgebiet gelesen. Er sitzt mit Glas in der Hand in seiner Villa und sagt doch tatsächlich das Er der neue Nachfolger von Wolfgang Petry wird. Im Leben nicht! Es gibt nur ein Wolle und der würde mit seinem Album auf Platz 1 einsteigen. Das wird ein Herr Wendler mit diesem Album nie im Leben schaffen. Meins steht schon wieder zum Verkauf an. Erste und letzte mal ein Album von M. Wendler. Schade eigentlich."
1,"Hiiilfe,ich habe mir die ganzen Lieder des Albums angehört und hatte das Empfinden,es wäre ein und die selbe Melodie.Eigentlich ist Mark Medlock ein guter Sänger mit einer schönen Stimme.Was aber schrecklich ist,das Dieter Bohlen für ihn immer nur die selben Lieder komponiert.Ich frage mich ernsthaft,wie lange überhaupt dessen Masche noch funktionieren kann und die Leute dem zweiten Modern Talking diese Musik abkaufen."
1,"Geht es Tarkan nur noch um die Kohle? 10 Lieder davon 5 Remixe. Einfallsloser geht es wohl kaum. Das warte ich lieber ein paar Jahre länger auf ein ""richtiges Album""! Schade, so vergrault man sich Fans!!!"
2,"..schade trotz der Gastsprecher Judy Winter und Dirk Bach ist diese Folge die wohl bisher schwächste der Dr3i. Das liegt wohl vor allem am schwachen Drehbuch und dem nervigen ""Porky-Pig"". Vielleicht sind Neu-Hörer jüngeren Baujahrs begeistert, die Stammhörer die die Geschichten der ??? seit der Kindheit verfolgen werden enttäuscht sein. Trotzdem als Fan bleibt einem wohl nichts anders übrig als kaufen und sich auf die nächte Folge -der kopflose Reiter am 08. Juni zu freuen."
1,Das Sequel zu den Terminator Filmen kann nicht im Geringsten eine der Qualitäten der ersten beiden Streifen aufweisen.
1,"Ach, wie originell... Warum kommt uns jede zweite ""Neofolk-Dark-Goth-Military-Pop-oder-sonstwas""-Nachzügler-Formation, die irgendwann einmal eine Scheibe von Current 93 gehört haben muß, mit dem abgelutschtesten Begriff des Genres, Tusch: ""Apocalypse""? Hier in diesem Fall halt leicht abgewandelt als ""Apocalips"". Wer wirklich an apokalyptischen Szenarien einen Gefallen gefunden hat, möchte sich bitteschön Gemälde von Hyronimus Bosch oder Pieter Breughel anschauen. Solls trotzdem musikalisch ""apokalyptisch-folkig"" sein, dann sind die ""Apocalyptic Folk""-Originale von Current 93 immer noch die beste Empfehlung, David Tibet nimmt man schliesslich seine ""apokalyptischen Visionen"" ab - diesem Gothic-Zielgruppen-massgeschneiderten Machwerk von Ordo Rosarius Equilibrio nehme ich nur eines ab: auf Nummer Sicher gehendes (und musikalisch langweiliges) wohliges Suhlen im immergleichen Dark-Wave-Sumpf. So mutet bereits die Schilderung in der Kurzbeschreibung (""...atemberaubende, bittersüsse Tracks voller poetischer Endzeitstimmung"") an, als wäre diese des Reklameteils einer einschlägigen Szenegazette entliehen. Was mich schliesslich zu der Frage verleitet, was eigentlich eine ""poetische Endzeitstimmung"" sein mag? Mit Endzeitstimmung verbinde ich persönlich nunmal nichts aber auch gar nichts ""poetisches""... Oder fehlt mir am Ende gar das Quentchen melodramatisches Selbstmitleid um in der ""Endzeit"" wohlige Momente der Gruselromantik zu entdecken? Aber die Zielgruppe scheint ja auf Derartiges zu stehen, so erkläre ich mir zumindest das Zustandekommen von Songtiteln wie ""I think about Germany and the End of the world"", ""Blitzkrieg of Roses"" (???) oder ""She's in Love with a whip - my Venus in Furs"". Immer die gleichen abgeschmackten Attribute und Erkennungsmale des Genres: ein bisserl martialisch anmutender ""Military-Pop"" hier, ein wenig diffus-düsterer Weltanschauungskitsch dort und der obligatorische Flirt mit S/M-light mittendrin. Dazu die tausendmal gehörten und immer wiedergekäuten Dark-Wave/Neo-Folk-Arrangements (und ewig grüsst das Murmeltier...), recht uninspiriert eingespielt und nicht mal besonders ansprechend produziert - über dieses Album kann man getrost den Sargdeckel des Vergessens knallen lassen. Leute, investiert Euer gutes Geld lieber in Current 93-, Death In June- oder Sol Invictus-Alben, wenn ihr schon auf diesen Sound abfahrt..."
1,"will den jetzt jeder Schüler Sänger Sänger werden??? Einfach nur peinlich, trifft keinen ton, und das Video toppt alles.Vielleicht ist er als Schauspieler geeignet aber nie als sänger. ein Möchtegern, wenn die messlatte mittlerweile schon so tief is kann ja jeder einen Song aufnehmen und kommt damit in die charts."
1,"...diese Jungs doch sind. Bierzeltkombo nenne ich sowas. Covern altbekannte Lieder ( mehr schlecht als recht ) und packen einen neuen Text drüber. Na ja, Text ist vielleicht etwas übertrieben. Sinnlose Reime, die von einem Drittklässler stammen könnten trifft die Sache wohl eher. Dass die Jungs aber scheinbar der vollen Überzeugung sind, dass ihre lyrischen Ergüsse witzig sind, lässt mich doch stark an der Menschheit zweifeln. HeadBangBoing, Promibeat800, Osama sind Songs zum davon rennen. Oder für die Schlagerparade im ZDF. Wenn die Band es wenigstens schaffen würde satirisch vorzugehen, dann hätte ich ja überhaupt nichts dagegen, aber diese ultrabillige Klamaukschiene ist in meinen Augen nur jämmerlich. Das man dann auch noch wagt, Slayer zu verunstalten, gibt mir nicht nur den Rest, sondern ist schlichtweg nicht tolerierbar. Demnächst wohl auf Tour mit Stefan Raab oder einer Reunion von Insterburg und Co."
2,"Wieder ein Konzeptalbum aus dem Hause Hancock; diesmal als Hommage an die Sängerin/Autorin Joni Mitchell gedacht. An Prominenz fehlt es nicht: Neben Hancock am Piano sind Wayne Shorter ts,ss, der hier leider ziemlich untergehende Dave Holland b, der ebenfalls kaum hervortretende Gitarren-Neustar Lionel Loueke g und Vinnie Colaiuta dm am Werk und drapieren die gesanglichen Beiträge von u.a. Norah Jones, Tina Turner, Luciana Souza, Leonard Cohen sowie der also Geadelten selbst. Gewiss, die einzelnen Songs sind zum Teil recht hübsch, wenngleich von geringer Variationsbreite. Bemerkenswert ist, dass Tina Turner hier Gelegenheit hat, das verbleichende Etikett der Rockröhre abzustreifen und tatsächlich einmal ihr Gesangstalent vorzführen. Wayne Shorter steuert neben der Komposition Nefertiti"" aus der späteren Phase des 2. klassischen Miles Davis Quintetts (was die wohl mit Joni Mitchell zu tun hat?) seine zerbrechlichen aber immer noch schimmernden Saxofontöne bei; Ingredienzien zu einem Gebräu, das dann doch keine richtig wärmende Suppe wird. Das Ganze funktioniert vor allem deshalb nicht, weil bei Mitchell Song, Text  und Interpretation eine Einheit bilden, was hier ent- und somit auseinander fällt. Deshalb hält man sich wohl besser ans Original, denn Joni ist bei Mitchell doch wohl am besten aufgehoben."
5,"Nachdem ich von einem Bekannten den ersten Song der aktuellen Scheibe gezeigt bekommen hatte wurde ich neugierig. 'President' entzückte mich mit einer gelungenen Mischung aus atmosphärischer Spannung, seichten Klavier-Klängen und einer atemberaubenden Stimme des Sängers. Nachdem ich mich ein bischen über IAMX erkundigt hatte und einige Rezenssionen über ""The Alternative"" las war ich gespannt, wie der Rest des Albums auf mich wirken würde. Ich bestellte es ohne weitere Tracks gekannt und gehört zu haben. Im Verlaufe des ersten Hörens entzückte mich die Vielfallt der Elemente. Insbesondere die Atmosphäre der einzelnen Songs entwickelte sich zu einem prägenden Aspekt, der mich fazinierte. Die Songs sind sehr abwechslungsreich und pendeln zwischen tanzbarem elektronischen Sound und düsteren PopRock, der stellenweise sogar an Depeche Mode und Muse erinnert. Die Stimme von Chris Corner, seines Zeichen Sänger von den Sneaker Pimps, fügt den Kompositionen allerdings eine ganz indivudelle Note bei und drückt einen markanten Stempel auf, mit dem ein Garant für eine Wiedererkennung geschaffen wird. Song Nummer Zwei 'The Alternative' gehört bereits zu den hochklassigsten Tracks des Albums. Mit einem elektronischen Beat beginnend steigert sich der Song in seinem Verlauf kontinuierlich, eher er dann in seinen persönlichen Zenit in Form des Refrains ufert. Die folgenden vier Nummern spiegelen den stark elektronisch fixierten Teil des Albums wieder. Man verspührt gerade zu den Charme von kleinen verrauchten Nachtclubs, irgendwo in einer Großstadt, die einem nahezu zwanghaft in die Vorstellung eingehämmert werden. Schliesst man die Augen, so kann man sich vorstellen, dass man sich Mitten in einer vibrierenden Masse befindet, die zu diesen sphärischen Klängen die Nacht zum Tage macht und wie in Extase zu der Musik harmoniert und tanzt. Allerdings muss hier deutlich gemacht werden, dass es sich nicht um industrielle Klänge geschweige den Techno-Allüren handelt. Alles hat die Komponente von elektronischen IndiePop. Ab Song Nummer Acht beginnt eine neue Phase des Albums. Eine melancholischere, eine melodischere und depressivere Stimmung begleiten nun die musikalichen Momente noch stärker und prägender. Auch die düsteren Klavier Klänge werden ab dieser Hälfte des Albums vermehrt eingesetzt und verzaubern den Hörer mit nahezu hypnotischen Melodien. Gerade bei diesen Songs wird das Ausnahmepotenzial von Chris Corners Stimme mehr als deutlich. Mit 'Spit it Out' folgt nun mein persönliches Highlight von ""The Alternative"". Man kann diesen Track am besten beschreiben, in dem man ihm den Charakter einer Aufbruchstimmung zugesteht. Die zutiefst trauriegen Lyrics spiegeln die emotionalen Elemente wieder, die duch diesen Song transportiert werden. Musikalich, von der Songstruktur und dem Arrangement her könnte man diesen Song teilweise mit Bands wie Dredg oder sogar Coldplay vergleichen. Hinzu kommt allerdings abermals der düstere elektronische Sound und die Stimme des Protagonisten, die den Song zu einem Stück Individualität machen. 'After Every Party I Die' geht wieder ein Stück in Richtung von tanzbarer Disco Musik. Allerdings verliert der starre Beat,der zu Beginn des Songs noch prägend ist, im Verlaufe der steigenden Spannungskurve an Bedeutung und wird mit dem Beginn des Refrains zur Nebensache. Dieser bezaubert den Hörer abermals und verleitet zum Augenschliessen und Träumen. Hierzu trägt nicht minder ""Sue Denim"" bei, die Chris Corner bei besagten Song im Refrain unterstützt. Ein Duett, das zu entzücken weiß! 'This Will make you love again' könnte man als die Offenbarung des gesamten ""Kunstwerks"" bezeichen. Rein orchestral, nur in Form von einem Klavier beginnt der Song sehr depressiv und düster ehe der Refrain einem das berüchtigte Gänsehaut-Feeling verleiht und man ab diesem Zeitpunkt nur nur noch staunen kann. Nachdem einen die Worte fehlen bleibt nur noch die Möglichkeit und die Pflicht diesen Song und den damit perfekten Abschluss des Albums zu geniessen. Somit will festgehalten sein, dass IAMX zweites Werk nach ""Kiss and Swallow"" von 2004 sicherlich neben dem neuen Album von Muse zu den besten und wichtigsten Alben des Jahres 2006 hört. Man kann nur hoffen, dass Ausnahmekünstler Chris Corner uns auch in Zukunft mit solchen Ergüssen beglückt und ihn auch weiterhin Dinge wie ""Seeliche Vergewaltigung"", ""Schlaflosigkeit"" oder auch die Stadt ""Berlin"" eine Inspiration bieten."
5,"Sicherlich muss es nichts bedeuten, wenn sich eine Band (oder ein EinMannProjekt, da ist man sich bei der aktuellen FotN-Formation ja nicht ganz sicher) ganze 10 Jahre für ein Album Zeit lässt. Aber in diesem speziellen Fall hat sich jede Minute des Wartens für den Fan gelohnt. ""Mourning Sun"" IST ein Meisterwerk, da gibt es nichts zu deuteln. Sofort mit Beginn des Intros und dem Einsatz des Samples ""cover his face, so that he may not see the light"" befällt einen faustgroß die Gänsehaut und klingt bis zum letzten Raunen der Coverversion von ""In the year 2525"" nicht ab. Carl McCoy ist ein Visionär, und die Songs sind von elegischer und epischer Tragweite wie sie keine zweite Gothic-Formation zeitlebens in auch nur ähnlicher Art zu schaffen in der Lage war. Vergleiche mit Bands wie den Sisters, Garden of Delight oder den Dreadful Shadows sind daher unpassend, denn keiner der vielleicht bekannteren Genre-Größen transportiert auch nur annähernd soviel Mythologie und Atmosphäre. ""Mourning Sun"" ist das perfekte Bindeglied zwischen dem letzten regulären Fields-Album ""Elizium"" und dem BlackMetal-Ausflug ""ZOON"", besitzt die Härte des letzteren und die herrlichen, in ihrer repetitiven Art fast schon mantra-artigen Endlos-Parts des ersteren Albums. Darüber die Stimme McCoys, der eher predigt als singt und uns ein weiteres Mal die Tür zu altsumerischen, lovecraft'schen und schlicht vergessenen Glaubensnischen öffnet. Definitiv kein Album zum Bügeln oder Kochen, sondern Musik, der man sich ganz widmen muss. Dann allerdings wird man die Bilder im Kopf nicht mehr übersehen können ? . Als Anspiel-Tipp empfehle ich das ""Requiem"" - wer ""Celebrate"" mochte, wird hier einen Kniefall machen!"
5,"Als MetallicA Fan muss man das einfach haben. Geniale Aufnahmen der Besten Band der Welt. Aber Achtung: Da die DVD's Code1 sind, muss man einen DVD Player haben, der diesen (Code1, USA, KANADA) unterstützt. (Europa hat Code2). Auch nicht alle DVD Player für den Pc unterstützen den diesen Code. Mit InterVide WinDVD kann man die DVD's problemlos abspielen, nicht aber mit dem InterActual Player!"
2,"Mike Oldfield hat sich stets weiterentwickelt, neue Sounds ausprobiert und sich neuer Technik bedient. Oldfield sagt selbst, dass die Tubular Bells Zeiten endgültig vorbei seien. Das waren andere Zeiten und es würde langweilen auf der Ebene weiterzumachen."
1,"Schlechte Idee alte Songs in neuem Gewand aufzukochen. Nicht nur, dass es meiner Meinung nach schlecht durchgezogen wurde, die Qualität ist zudem auch schlechter, als man es heute erwarten kann. Traurig diese CD."
5,"Dennis Ward hat mal wieder eine Klasse Produktion abgeliefert. Dank dem italienischen Plattenlabel erblicken endlich Songs von Joe Lynn Turner`s nie gemachten 2. Studioalbum,welches 1985/86 erschienen wäre, das Licht. Und so ist auch der Sound der Scheibe, wie aus den 80ern. Und Turner singt wie immer phänomenal. Auch wurden Stücke von z.B. Jim Peterik (Survivor,Pride Of Lions) aus den 80ern verwendet. Alles ist auf allerhöchstem Niveau und die deutschen Musiker machen einen spitzenmäßigen Job. Hoffentlich gibt es davon eine Fortsetzung!"
5,"Als alter Magnum und Herr der Ringe Fan bin ich sehr kritisch an die Sache rangegangen und hab mir die CD wohl eher aus Neugier gegönnt. Eine sehr gute Entscheidung! Die Stücke gehen etwas in die Richtung Chase the Dragon und sind meiner Meinung nach genau die richtige Hintergrundmusik für das Schwelgen in Mittelerde. Man merk sofort, dass Bob Catley ein Tolkien Fan ist.  Ohne Kompromisse volle Punktzahl!"
5,"Jaja, wiedermal fliegt uns eine neue Scheibe des Quartetts aus Schweden ins Haus, und was soll man sagen: Wieder mal ein Death-Metal Hammer der sich sehen lassen (und hören) lassen kann! Auf die Frage ob es was neues gibt, beläuft sich meine Antwort eindeutig auf JA! Und zwar sprechen wir hier von  Hypo-Neuling Horgh und seinem Drumming - einige der Songs scheinen direkt auf seine Trommlerei abgestimmt worden zu sein, was dem Album eine Dynamik verleiht, die man von den Hypos schon lange nicht mehr gehöhrt hat. Kompositionstechnisch bleiben sich Hypocrisy absolut treu und machen das, was sie schon immer gekonnt haben: Sie schreiben Songs mit eingängigen Melodien und vermischen diese mit der nötigen Härte die der Song braucht; sei es nun Ballade,ein Mid-Tempo Kracher oder eine hyperschnelle Death Nummer. Die Scheibe vereint alle Stärken mit denen sich Hypocrisy auf ihren 9 vorangegangen Albem auszeichneten, und das gefällt! Wehr denkt Hypocrisy kopieren sich mit diesem Album wiedermal selbst, könnte natürlich Recht haben - doch dies muss ja nicht negativ sein - oder war hier jeder mit Catch 22 zufrieden? Das Album gehört in die CD Sammlung wie die Faust aufs Auge! Absoluter Pflichtkauf für alle Death Metal Jünger!"
1,"die melodie von ""ich bin ein star"" ist schon seit hundert jahren bekannt, die umsetzung der jungle b und c prominenz ist äußerst schwach. der andere titel erinnert an pfadfinder lieder. das allerletzte!!! und wer meint er bekommt costas jungle-beat dazu, der täuscht. der ist auf einer extra maxi, von alpha-music. das hat rtl ja geschickt gemacht: costas song wurde weitgehend mit anderer musik überspielt bei seiner ""krönung"", werbung nur in eigener sache und costa durfte in der talkshow danach bei schrowange nicht mal seine cd in die kamera halten. bei so wenig möglichkeiten die rtl costa gibt, kanns nicht verwundern, dass costas jungle-beat auf verkaufsrang 2000 irgendwas hier ist. sauerei wie rtl costas lied totschweigt, kein wunder stehts ja mit der eigenen maxi in konkurrenz ;o)"
1,"Weiter so: ""Rock'n'Roll und Alkohol und a Harley fahr'n"" - und alles möglichst gleichzeitig! Den Dorfrockern scheint diese Mischung zu gefallen, denn in ihrem ""Hit"" (hahaha) ""Die Yodlparty"" geht es zu 99% um betrunkene Menschen. Wenn man sich dann das ganze Album reinzieht und man feststellt, dass ""Die Yodelparty"" von anderen Titeln an Geschmacklosigkeit noch übertroffen wird, dann wird das ganze Ausmaß dieser Tragödie sichtbar."
2,"Es gibt Alben, die entziehen sich den üblichen, kategorisierten Arbeitstechniken der Rezeption. Der aufgescheuchten Kritik bleibt letztlich nur die Wahl zwischen Verriss, Leugnen oder kollektivem Jubelsturm. Was heute für RADIOHEAD gilt, das erlangte vor vierunddreißig Jahren Van Morrison mit ""Astral Weeks"": Kulstatus.  Niemand verstand und versteht so recht den Kern dieses spiritualistischen FolkJazz-Gedudels, also mußte es sich um einen Meilenstein der Popmusik handeln. Ich halte dieses Album für einen Anachronismus par exzellence. Das Material ist selbstverständlich überdurchnschnittlich, aber transzendentale Welten (er-)öffnet diese introspektive, deliziöse Art von Musik keineswegs. Ich habe sie gelegentlich zum Einschlafen genutzt - klappte hervorragend!  Es gibt sehr viele göttliche Pop/Rock-Alben, die im Schatten frieren, weil Steinblöcke wie ASTRAL WEEKS, SGT. PEPPER, DARK SIDE OF THE MOON etc. nicht weggeräumt werden. Das ist furchtbar, andererseits aber auch wieder wunderbar natürlich, denn die Welt ist eben weder gerecht noch ungerecht.  Sie ist..."
2,"Diese Platte enthält die schlechtesten Liveaufnahmen von CREAM. Der Sound ist undifferenziert und ""White Room"" und ""Deserted Cities Of The Heart"" enthalten deutliche Verspieler. Zudem ist Clapton als Improvisator einfach nicht flexibel und einfallsreich genug um ein Stück wie ""Stepping Out"" quasi im Alleingang zu gestalten. Auch der Smash-Hit ""Sunshine Of Love"" kommt in dieser siebeneinhalb minütigen Fassung sehr träge und langweilig rüber. Lediglich ""Polititian"" und ""Tales Of Brave Ulysses"" entfalten einen gewissen Druck, leiden aber auch wie alle anderen Stücke unter der schlechten Abmischung. Wesentlich bessere Livemitschnitte dieser einstigen ""Supergroup"" finden sich auf dem Doppelalbum ""Wheels Of Fire"" und dem ersten ""Live Cream"" Album."
5,"bereitet uns Lauryn Hill mit ihrer neuen CD 2.0.  Das Live-konzert, was schon 2001 aufgenommen wurde besticht durch Lauryns einzigartige Stimme, die inovativen und kritischen Lyrics (""Fantasy is what they want, Reality what they need""). Natürlich ist das Album nicht so zugänglich wir ihr grandioses Debüt, da auf 2.0 kein richtiger Chartbreaker drauf ist.  Als Anspieltips sind OH Jerusalem und das traurige Peace of Mind zu erwähnen. Aber auch Water, Mr. Intentional und I get out. Dieses Album ist nichts für jedermann, aber für gute Hinhörer ein Genuß. Danke Lauryn!"
5,Also für meinen Teil war ich schon lange auf der Suche nach einer Weihnachts-CD die für jeden was bietet. Ich kann die Rock Christmas nur weiterempfehlen wenn man nicht auf das 08/15 Zeug steht welches man dann jeden Tag in jedem Einkaufsladen hört!
5,"Genial was die Jungs da wieder gemacht haben, für mich eine Reise in die Jugend, nachdem die Erstveröffentlichung auf CD eine grausige Angelegenheit gewsen war. Da ich inzwischen eigentlich nur noch nach alten Sachen, die remastered neu aufgelegt werden Ausschau halte ( siehe auch Tears for Fears, Human League, Ultravox etc...), hat mich diese Neuveröffentlichung sehr überzeugt. Wahnsinn was mit den Original Tapes noch zu machen ist. Da ist auch zu verschmerzen, dass bei den drei neuen CDS leider keine Bonus Tracks mitgeliefert wurden."
2,"alles das was unser guter Bob hier abliefert. Inhaltlich gute Musik wurde hier beim Mixen verpuscht. Bitte lass beim nächsten Mal einen ´ran ders kann lieber Bob! 4,5 Sterne für die Musik, 2,5 Abzug für diesen Grottensound."
5,"Falconer sind zurück und zwar besser als je zuvor. Die Stimme von Mathias Blad passt einfach perfekt zu dieser Band. Nach dem ersten Anhören war ich ehrlich gesagt ein klein wenig enttäuscht da das Album irgendwie ganz anders klingt als die ersten beiden. Nach mehrmaligem Anhören gefällt mir die Scheibe aber interessanterweise sogar besser als alle vorherigen. Dies liegt vor allem daran, dass der Sound jetzt irgendwie ""erwachsener"" klingt als zuvor. Die Gitarrenarbeit ist phänomenal und das Schlagzeug sorgt ebenfalls für Laune. Einige Stücke sind richtig schnell und hart, andere eher balladenartig und manche sind sogar beides. Ich wollte eigentlich an dieser Stelle die besten Songs des Albums nennen. Allerdings hebt sich keiner der Titel derart stark von den anderen ab, dass dies Sinn machen würde. Ganz abgesehen davon sind einfach zu viele Musikrichtungen vertreten, als dass man die einzelnen Tracks überhaupt miteinander vergleichen dürfte. Schlechte bzw. schwächere Titel sind - meiner Meinung nach - nicht vorhanden. Die schwedischen Bonustracks finde ich ebenfalls klasse - auch wenn ich vom Text her nicht verstehe um was es geht. Also an alle, die nach dem ersten Reinhören nicht wirklich überzeugt sind: Bitte mehrmals anhören, es lohnt sich auf jeden Fall!"
5,"Stryper melden sich mit einem mehr als gelungenen Album wieder zurück. Nach dem eher durchschnittlichen ""Reborn"" legen sie eine Scheibe vor, welche nahtlos an ""In God We Trust"" anknüpfen könnte. Alles ist wieder beim alten und Stryper besinnen sich wieder auf ihr genialen Wurzeln der 80er Jahre. Auf der Scheibe sind durchweg Stampfer enthalten, welche sich in den Gehörgängen festsetzen. Mit ""Alive"" ist auch wieder eine geniale Ballade enthalten, welche für dicke Gänsehaut sorgt. Michael Sweet glänzt nach wie vor mit seiner wahnsinns Stimme. Die Songtexte versprühen einfach Hoffnung und sorgen für gute Laune. Mein Anspieltipp ist der Titeltrack ""Murder By Pride"" und die Ballade ""Alive"". Durchweg sind aber alle Songs wirklich eingängige Rocker. Der einzige Kritikpunkt ist meiner Ansicht nach vielleicht das Albumcover. Also - alte Stryper Fans können wieder bedenkenlos zugreifen - alle anderen sollten es auch tun! BACK TO THE ROOTS!"
1,"Zuerst die Bewertung der einzelnen Titel: 01. Under Control Schnell, aber leider nicht melodisch genug, teilweise auch disharmonisch. Nix besonderes. 02. Higher Than The Sky Ebenfalls teilweise disharmonisch, hat aber immerhin einen guten Refrain (bis auf das Ende). Ansonsten nix besonderes. 03. Deep In The Blackest Hole Ein ziemlich eintöniger Titel, der aber immerhin einen guten Refrain hat. ""Peavys"" Stimme ist hier auffällig schwach, ohne Feuer. 04. End Of All Days Der beste Titel des Albums, melodisch und mitreißend. Der Refrain ist sehr gut (bis auf das Ende). 05. Visions Ein etwas zwiespältiger Titel, der ausschließlich von seinem mitreißenden Refrain lebt. Der Rest ist nix besonderes, halbwegs melodisch, teilweise jedoch etwas disharmonisch. Bis hierher hinterlässt das Album einen durchschnittlichen bis leicht positiven Eindruck, diese Qualität konnte man von RAGE erwarten. Was nun aber folgt, ist ein Absturz in den tiefsten musikalischen Folterkeller. 06. Desperation Ein disharmonischer Titel mit schwachem Refrain. Insgesamt schwach. 07. Voice From The Vault Sehr disharmonisch, eine echte Zumutung für den Hörer. Beim Refrain haben sich ""Peavy"" &amp; Co. stark am Refrain von ""End Of All Days"" orientiert, die Ähnlichkeit fällt sofort auf. Doch selbst dieser erstklassige Refrain wurde hier so verunstaltet, dass es in den Ohren wehtut. 08. Let The Night Begin Wieder ein disharmonischer Titel mit schwachem Refrain. Insgesamt schwach. 09. Fortress Dasselbe in langsamem Tempo. Wieder teilweise disharmonisch und mit schwachem Refrain. Insgesamt schwach. 10. Frozen Fire Sehr disharmonisch, sehr schwacher Refrain. Insgesamt sehr schwach, eine echte Zumutung. 11. Talking To The Dead Teilweise disharmonisch, und ein schwacher Refrain. Insgesamt schwach. 12. Face Behind The Mask Teilweise disharmonisch, aber mit akzeptablem Refrain. Dennoch insgesamt schwach. 13. Silent Victory Sehr disharmonisch, und ein schwacher Refrain. Insgesamt sehr schwach, eine echte Zumutung. 14. Fading Hours Zum Schluss noch ein melodischer Titel mit klassischen Elementen, eine Art Vorschau auf das Album ""XIII"". Aber: Wer ""XIII"" hat, braucht diesen Titel nicht. Fazit: Zu Beginn ein paar mittelmäßige und ein sehr guter Titel, danach aber nur noch Murks (abgesehen von ""Fading Hours""). Am Schluss ist man heilfroh, dass man es endlich überstanden hat. ""End Of All Days"" ist das schlechteste RAGE-Album seit ""Reflections Of A Shadow"", Heavy Metal zum Abgewöhnen. Was für ein Absturz nach dem genialen Vorgänger ""Black In Mind""."
5,"Diese CD ist ein wahres Kleinod an Musikstücken dargeboten von Montserrat Caballe u. ihrer hübschen u. ebenfalls begabten Tochter Montserrat Marti. Die Tochter hat auch eine ganz tolle Stimme u. singt einfach fabelhaft, sie steht ihrer Mutter durchaus in nichts nach !!! Mein Lieblingsstück ist ein Duett von Mutter u. Tochter auf der CD, das sich ""Bolero"" nennt (of white diamonds oder so ähnlich), es ist wirklich ein ganz hervorragendes Lied, das Sie sich unbedingt anhören sollten, hier kommt das ganze Temperament Spaniens zum Ausdruck. Ansonsten sind die Stücke zum Teil von der Mutter u. zum Teil von der Tochter gesungen, so daß man von jeder Künstlerin etwas hat. Um nur zwei bekannte Stücke zu nennen, die unter anderem auf der CD sind, so seien ""Oh mio babbino caro"" u. ""Deine Lippen sie küssen so heiß"" genannt, damit Sie eine gewisse Vorstellung davon haben, was Sie erwartet. Mir hat die CD sehr gut gefallen u. ich kann sie nur weiter empfehlen."
5,"Okay, es sind noch gut 9 Monate hin - aber im Melodic Metal Sektor hat das Album echt das Zeug zum Album des Jahres. Ich höre es jedenfalls rauf und runter und bekomm nicht genug davon!!!"
5,"als erstes mal Lob an Ensiferum. Einfach nur Hammer dat Album. Ich möchte keinen Song auf der Scheibe besonders hervorheben, sie sind alle Cool, aber ich empfehle ""Slayer Of Light""-ein Viking-Metal Riff gedonner, ""Tears""-eine Herrlich eiskalt den Rücken runterlaufende Stimme mit echt ergreifendem Text. Sowie ""Lost In Despair""-der leicht Melancholisch wirkende Mid-tempo song. Und ""Lai Lai Hei""-die Folk-Viking-Black-Metal mischung. Alles in allem klingt das Album ziemlich anspruchsvoll, und doch kann mann nicht anders und muss seinen Kopf wie Wild durch die Bude schmeissen. Hat MINDESTENS 5 Sterne verdient."
2,"ich kann mir die Platte nur als eine Sammlung potenzieller B Seiten erklären. Denn mir gefällt diese Platte überhaupt nicht. Ist das erste mal das ich keine positiven superlative benutze für ein Album von Farin Urlaub aber das hier ist wirklich nicht gut. verworrene Texte, konstruierte Musik.  Nicht mein Fall. Trotzdem noch 2 Sympatiesterne"
1,"Das rote Pferd- was soll denn das sein? Als ich nach CD's des Neue-Deutsche-Welle-Sängers Markus suchte, tauchte diese obskure CD auf. Warum dies im Zusammenhang mit Markus geschah, kann ich nicht sagen, obwohl manche sicherlich Lieder wie ""Ich will Spaß"" usw. ähnlich niveaulos finden werden. Doch das rote Pferd- das ist schlimm, wirklich schlimm! Zwar gab es diese Version mit dem ""Pferd, das mit seinem Schwanz die Fliegen ab(ge)wehrt"" schon sehr lange als Kinderlied in Kindergärten (da werden schon die ganz Kleinen, die sich nicht wehren können, verblödet), aber eigentlich ist die Melodie ja die vom großen Cahnson ""Milord"", das unter anderem durch Edith Piaf bekannt wurde. Schlimm finde ich nicht nur, dass Markus Becker feat. Mallorca anscheinend nicht genug Hirn haben, um sich etwas eigenes auszudenken; schlimm finde ich auch nicht nur, dass das Ganze so sinnfrei daherkommt, so dass dies anscheinend nur mit 5 Promille erträglich ist; schlimm finde ich vor allem, dass heute beim weltweiten Ausverkauf der Kunst ein echter Klassiker vergewaltigt werden darf! Sind denn solche Lieder nicht geschützt gegen solche Frevler? Der ursprüngliche französische Text beschreibt ein Lebensgefühl, eine Reflexion der Schwierigkeit, zu leben und mit seinen Fehlern klarzukommen....Hier wird das Ganze nur zu einem einzigen Klo-Text- zum Runterspülen.... Warum lassen wir so etwas nur zu?  Und vor allem- was ich am Erschreckendsten finde: Warum gibt es einen so großen Bedarf nach solchen Liedern? Was kann noch kommen?"
5,"Die neue Scheibe ist im Handel und ich habe diese mit der nötigen Vorfreude in mein Autoradio geschoben. Einfach klasse, die Lieder 5 - 9 sind typisch spitze. Ich kann nur zu dieser CD eine kurze Bewertung schreiben, einfach gut!   (Das letzte Lied (Art) (CD1) darf nie wieder auf eine Disco Boys!!!)"
2,"Ganz originell ist das Konzept der „Disco Boys"" ja: House-Tracks mit 80er-Jahre Hits wie „Wild Boys"" von Duran Duran, Camouflages „Great Commandment"" oder „Es geht voran"" von den Fehlfarben zu mischen. Ganz zu schweigen von dem noch älteren „Rapture"" von Blondie. Und live sollen die Jungs ja auch richtig gut sein und Party-Stimmung verbreiten. Aber auf  CD geht die Party gar nicht so richtig ab. Gerade die eigenwillige Mischung führt dazu, dass man das Tanzbein nicht richtig schwingen kann. Will man mal anfangen, wird man durchs nächste Lied bestimmt runtergebracht. Wer will schon zu Duran Duran tanzen? Allenfalls Sentimentalität wecken ist da drin. Und zum nebenbei laufen lassen ist die Scheibe dann doch zu stressig. Aus dem Club-Bereich sind aber auch ein paar Knaller wie zum Beispiel „Make Luv"" von Room 5, „Young Love"" von Kid Alex und „Release your Mind"" auf der CD enthalten. Durchlaufen lassen sollte man die Tracks 6-8 auf CD 2. Überhaupt ist die zweite CD deutlich besser als die erste. Das liegt auch an den beiden Goldstücken „8:15 to Nowhere"" von Vicious Pink und dem Club-Klassiker „Jaguar"". Die Doppel-CD krankt aber an dem alten Sampler-Problem: Ein paar Stücke gefallen, der Rest ist zum Auffüllen. Wer auf stilistischen Mischmasch steht, der wird daran vielleicht sogar seinen Gefallen finden. Ansonsten sollte man vom Kauf eher Abstand nehmen, deshalb auch nur 2 Sterne."
5,".... ist es das man diese tolle Stimme zum letzten Mal mit neuem Material gehört hat. Nun gut, ganz so neu sind die Songs nicht, aber man hört ihnen einfach an wieviel sie Agnetha bedeuten. Die Musik der 60er war nie mein Ding. Aber bitte: NICHT ABSCHRECKEN LASSEN! Dieses Album überzeugt vom ersten bis zum letzten Ton. Songs wie ""When you walk in the room"" oder ""A fool am I"" sind absolute Ohrwürmer. Die Interpretation von Agnetha und vor allem die musikalische Umsetzung ohne die Songs krampfhaft auf modern zu trimmen, gibt diesem Album einen Charme dem man sich nicht entziehen kann. Kurzum: ES LOHNT SICH DIESES ALBUM ZU KAUFEN! Ich denke mit dieser CD hat man noch lange Freude. Auch dann noch wenn man andere schon lange vergessen hat. Bleibt nur zu hoffen, das Agnetha uns nicht weitere 17 Jahre auf ein neues Album warten lässt."
1,wieso kommen seit ajhren immer wieder die selben best offs collections und was weiß ich von alice cooper auf den markt nur in neuem gewand und etwas anderer setliste   wer eine hat hat alle.. leute lasst euch nicht hinters licht führen... das ist abzocke ohne ende...kauft euch entweder die kompletten 3 alben von SONY und kauft nicht diese sinnlose best of (mit sicherheit schon die 30 ste wiederveröffentlichung der selben collections seit jahren)
1,"Ich kenne Nils Landgren, seit ich 1996 das ACT-Label entdeckte, und liebe seine Musik heiss und innig. Mehrfach schon war ich auf seinen Konzerten und es ist schon genial, welche Präsenz, Vielseitigkeit und Beherrschung seines Instruments Nils Landgren besitzt, der ohne weiteres in einem Atemzug mit Albert Mangelsdorff und Ray Anderson genannt werden muss. Seit der 1995 auf ACT erschienenen CD ""Live In Stockholm"" habe ich mir sämtliche Alben von ihm gekauft. Nun muss ich zugeben, dass ich eher Jazzhörer als Pophörer bin und mir ABBA stets akkustische Qualen bereitet haben. Auch bin ich kein großer Freund von Coverversionen, weil man dabei immer den leisen Verdacht hat, der Künstler brauchte das Geld. Ich bin auf der anderen Seite dennoch bereit, mich vom Gegenteil überzeugen zu lassen. So zum Beispiel auf dem Landgren-Album ""Fonk Da World"", wo er ""Riders On The Storm"" von den Doors und das eigentlich uncoverbare ""Rock It"" von Herbie Hancock genial verfunkt. ABBA-Songs wiederum leben eher von den Harmonien, wohingegen Funk eine eindeutig rhythmusorientierte Musik ist. Wenn man, wie auf diesem Album geschehen, den scharfen Rhythmus harmonisiert, kommt eine solche Scheibe heraus, die ganz schnell den Vorwurf der Fahrstuhlmusik erdulden muss. Dieses Problem wurde von Shakatak auf dem 1982 erschienenen Album ""Invitations"" besser gelöst. Wer verrappten Funk will sollte sich ""Unbegrenzt haltbar"" von der Jazzkantine anhören. Wer gerne Nils Landgren mit Balladen hören möchte ist mit ""Sentimental Journey"" bestens bedient. Wie auch manch andere Rezensenten erwähnen, lässt einen dieses Album seltsam unberührt, weil zu routiniert und glatt produziert. Für mich ist  der kleine Lichtblick ""Thank You For The Music"". Aus der Sicht des Funkhörers ist ""When All Is Said And Done"" völlig deplatziert. Hoffentlich kehrt Nils zu seiner alten Kreativität zurück. Natürlich sei es einem Künstler gegönnt wirtschaftlichen Erfolg zu haben. Mir bleibt es zu hoffen, dass es wieder besser wird."
5,"Über das Ende von Genesis ist schon häufig diskutiert worden. Die Meinungen gehen bei diesem Thema weit auseinander: Während einige Fans den Namen Genesis wohl in erster Linie mit der Stimme und den Songs von Phil Collins in Verbindung bringen und einen neuen Sänger gerade nach dem Erfolgsalbum ""We Can’t Dance"" nur schwer akzeptieren konnten, können andere Anhänger der Band bis heute nicht nachvollziehen, warum sein Nachfolger Ray Wilson trotz der hervorstechenden Qualitäten als Sänger und Frontmann von Mike Rutherford und Tony Banks nie wie ein gleichberechtigtes Bandmitglied behandelt worden ist. Obwohl das letzte Album der Gruppe (""Calling All Stations"") durchaus starke Kompositionen wie ""Calling All Stations"", ""There Must Be Some Other Way"", ""One Man’s Fool"" oder ""The Dividing Line"" enthält, die durch ihre düstere Atmosphäre schon fast an einige Genesis-Alben der 70er Jahre erinnern, wirkt das ganze Projekt im Nachhinein etwas halbherzig. Die Songs wurden zu schnell produziert, fast durchgängig am Ende ausgeblendet und größtenteils ohne Beteiligung von Ray Wilson geschrieben. Insgesamt ist deshalb ein Album ohne ""roten Faden"" oder richtiger Überzeugungskraft entstanden. Einen so prominenten Namen wie Phil Collins kann man in dieser Form selbst mit dem besten Sänger der Welt nicht ersetzen. Die Ende von Genesis war nach den verhältnismäßig schlechten Verkaufszahlen von ""Calling All Stations"" deshalb schon fast vorprogrammiert... Ray Wilson hat in den letzten Jahren deutlich bewiesen, dass man ihm nicht die Schuld an dieser Entwicklung geben kann. Besonders das Album ""Live And Acoustic"" (mit den genialen Interpretationen von ""Carpet Crawlers"", ""Lover's Leap"" und ""Mama"") und die dazugehörige Tour haben gezeigt, dass er ein begnadeter und wandlungsfähiger Sänger ist, der mehr Aufmerksamkeit und einen größeren Bekanntheitsgrad verdient hätte. Das neue Album ""Change"" belegt darüber hinaus, dass er außerdem ein sehr guter Songwriter ist. Neben melancholischen Balladen wie ""Beach"", U2-ähnlichen Rocksongs wie ""Goodbye Baby Blue"" oder folkloristischen Einflüssen (""Yesterday"") sind auf diesem Album auch Ohrwürmer (""Change"") zu finden, die Phil Collins oder Mike Rutherford nicht besser schreiben könnten. ""Change"" hat all das, was auf ""Calling All Stations"" an einigen Stellen einfach fehlte: Eingängige Melodien, Überzeugungskraft, ""Frische"" und eine Atmosphäre, die mehr an die erfolgreichen und produktiven Zeiten von Genesis erinnert als die letzten Veröffentlichungen von Phil Collins. Dazu tragen unter anderem auch die unverwechselbare Stimme, die akkustischen Elemente, die geschmackvollen Sounds und die abwechslungsreichen Songs bei. ""Change"" wird vermutlich kein ""Megaseller"" werden. Wilsons relativ geringer Bekanntheitsgrade, die ungerechtfertigte ablehnende Haltung einiger Genesis-Fans und Kritiker gegenüber seinen Fähigkeiten und die aktuellen Trends in den Charts (Stichwort ""Superstars"") stehen einem bahnbrechenden Erfolg wohl leider im Weg. Trotzdem wird das Album eine sehr gute Ausgangsposition für Ray Wilsons weitere Karriere bei dem deutschen Label ""Inside Out"" bieten. Endlich mal wieder ein Album mit ehrlicher, anspruchsvoller, solider und atmosphärischer Musik und einem charismatischen und ausdrucksstarken Sänger. Auf Live-Auftritte und Nachfolger-Alben darf man gespannt sein..."
1,"""Ich war neulich mit einem Mediziner aus. Ich glaube, er war Anästhesist - ich habe gar nichts gespürt."" So geht es mir auch mit dieser Platte (nur dass ich über den Witz immer noch lachen kann) - sie plätschert wiederholt vorbei wie ein Gebirgsbach, ohne wehzutun oder einen bleibenden Eindruck zu hinterlassen, und das ist wohl das Schlimmste, was man über Musik sagen kann. Dabei ist das Konzept dasselbe wie auf den drei vorangegangenen Alben - Tom Dowd als Produzent und die im Großen und Ganzen selbe Musikertruppe - nur dass Rod Stewart diesmal sogar 9 von 10 Songs mitkomponiert hat! Unverständlich, dass er nicht wenigstens einen Teil der Tugenden, die ""Foot loose &amp; fancy free"" vom Vorjahr ausmachten, mit rüberretten konnte! Die einzigen herausragenden Songs sind Da ya think I'm sexy und Attractive Female wanted, und das ist eine zu magere Ausbeute. Dazu kommt, dass Rod mit Da ya think I'm sexy sehr mit der Discowelle flirtet, sich ihr dabei aber eher anpasst als ihr seinen Stempel aufzudrücken. Das konnten die Stones (mit Miss you) und vor allem ABBA zur selben Zeit mit ""Voulez-vous"" besser: sie griffen Disco-Elemente auf und unterwarfen sie ihrem Stil. Bei Rod Stewart hört man zu stark das Schielen nach dem großen Erfolg, der es dann ja auch wurde. Im Begleitheft zu ""Storyteller"" räumt er ein, er könne sowohl diejenigen verstehen, die den Song lieben, als auch die, die ihn hassen. Die vertonte Kontaktanzeige Attractive Female wanted, obwohl ebenfalls musikalisch nicht ausgereift, haut mich jedesmal wieder wegen ihres Stewart-typischen postpubertären Humors um: ""I'm tired of buying Penthouse and Lui and Hustler / it's Friday night I'm all alone still a bachelor"" oder ""I'm lonely too long / all of my family think I'm gay"" - Rod bringt das wie kein zweiter, und das wird mich immer amüsieren. ""Deep down ain't we all a little juvenile"", fragt er in Ain't love a Bitch, was es ganz gut trifft. Ansonsten: es zirpen die Gitarren, es dudeln Flöten (!) im Hintergrund... aber bei welchem Song nochmal...? Egal! Standin' in the Shadows of Love, die einzige Coverversion, ist ein schamloser (und noch blasserer) Versuch, Da ya think I'm sexy zu kopieren (wahrscheinlich direkt hintereinander aufgenommen) - oder war es umgekehrt? Wen kümmert's? Der Titelsong sticht nicht aus dem Rest heraus, und Ain't Love a Bitch kann es musikalisch auch nicht reißen, selbst wenn es auf sehr amüsante Weise an Maggie May erinnert: ""Oh I didn't realize she made a first class fool out of me / Maggie if you're still out there the rest is history."" Tragisch nur, was der Qualität seiner Musik in den sieben Jahren seit seinem ersten Nr. 1-Hit mit Maggie May widerfahren ist! Obwohl auch diese Platte 2000 remastert erschien, klingt sie hörbar dumpfer als ihre Vorgänger. Ich kenne Rod Stewarts weitere Alben nur in Auszügen (die Hits und so), aber was ich kenne, lässt nur den Schluss zu, dass es weitere 15 Jahre dauern sollte, bis er mit ""Unplugged...and seated"" wieder ein Album vorlegte, das seine wirklichen Qualitäten zeigte."
5,"Ja, es stimmt. Perfect Remedy klingt wirklich kommerzieller, hat die schwächere Songs und wurde überproduziert. Aber es ist trotzdem ein gelungenes Album! Warum? Ganz einfach: Es klingt besser, je öfter man es hört! Songs wie ""Little Dreamer"", The Power of Rock"" oder ""Throw Her A Line"" entwickeln erst mit der Zeit ihre wahren Stärken. Zuerst denkt man sich, dass die höchstens ne gute B-Seite abgegeben hätten. Aber man ""gewöhnt"" sich sozusagen daran, dass es keine Top-Smash-Hits sind. Viele Songs auf dem Album klingen ruhig und gehen in Richtung Folk und Country, wie z.B. ""Address Book"", ""Tommy's in Love"", ""1000 Years"" und vorallem der beste Song in dem Stil: ""Going Down for the First Time"" mit einem sarkastischen tollen Text und einer entspannten, eingängigen Melodieführung. Richtig rocken tun dagegen die B-Seiten. Allen voran ""Rotten to the Bone"". Es ist tatsächlich der schnellste Song des Albums und bietet einen perfekten Konzert-Mitgröl-Refrain. Alles in Einem ist Perfect Remedy ein gutes Album, zwar nicht das beste von Quo, aber eins, an das man sich gewöhnen kann und sollte."
5,"Trotz neuem Sänger haben Megaherz absolut nix von ihrer alten Power verloren, die sie einfach ausstrahlen! Also ein absolutes Muss für jeden, der dieser Band verfallen ist ;-) Die neue Stimme ist vielleicht ein wenig melodischer, aber das schadet der harten Art in keinster Weise, eher untermalt es diese noch! Meiner Meinung nach ein rundherum perfektes Werk!!!"
2,"Oomph! Hast du geglaubt ich brauche Dich ! Erst jetzt verstehe ich den Text. Nein, ich will kein super limited Digipak incl. Bonus Dvd. Mein Telefonklingelton reicht mir, es brauch kein ""la le lu"" sein.  Eine einfache Cd, so wie die ersten fünf Silberlinge reicht, um glücklich zu werden. Manchmal ist weniger mehr. Wo ist der Minimalismus der ersten Tage, ich habe keine Zweifel das Dero sämtliche Tonhöhen erreicht, aber, ich will es nicht. Krankes Dasein hat keine Perfektion. Text, Musik und Sound bilden meiner Meinung nach keine Einheit mehr. Aber es gibt genug andere Menschen die anderer Meinung sind. Ich Akzeptiere und gönne Oomph diesen Erfolg, mit irgendwas muss man leider heutzutage sein Geld verdienen."
2,"Schade, die Vorschusslorbeeren von allen Seiten war sicher gut gemeint. Aber nein, auch dieses Album ist schwach. Da nützt auch die Mitarbeit seiner ex-Weggefährten Brian Eno und Paul Thompson nichts. Und die unsägliche Coverversion von Going Down ist dann wirklich eine Zumutung; Ferry hätte besser die Versionen von Savoy Brown oder Chicken Shack raufgepackt. Nein, der Dandy ist endgültig von der Rolle."
4,"wenn ich diese CD in den Player lege, denke ich gar nicht daran, ob die restlichen Pink Floyd besser sind oder R. Waters.Ich genieße die Pink Floyd-Musik und dazu zähle ich auch die Solostücke von Waters. Ich muss alerrdings zugeben, dass ich sowohl auf der CD als auch im Konzert die Stimme und die Gittare von D. Gilmoure vermisst habe und vermisse und nichts kann für mich die Mitwirkung der anderen drei ersetzen aber darunter leiden wir ja alle. Ich glaube für uns Pink Floyd-Musik Liebhaber soll es keine Rolle spielen, was zwischen den 4 Musikern alles vorgefallen ist, vielmehr sollten wir die schöne Musik, die sie alle immernoch machen, genießen."
2,"Stoa ist für das Label ECM keine Krönung. Wahrscheinlich sind meine persönlichen Erwartungen zu hoch. Das erste Stück fängt interessant an, danach kommt langweiliger Sound. Erwarte von ECM wesentlich bessere Musik."
5,"Asja Valcic meint,immer nur Haydn und Mozart, das noch ein langes Leben lang, das sei zu langweilig.Bernie Mallinger kündigt weitere Projekte an. Das Kronos-Quartett hat über Jahrzehnte das Segment aussergewöhnlicher Musik für Streichquartett bedient, auch mit einigen cross-over-Projekten. Die Zeit des Kronos-Quartetts scheint abgelaufen. Das Radio.String. Quartett baut sich zu einem würdigen Nachfolger auf.Die vier führen vor, was vier Streicher alles  mit ihren Instrumenten machen können,wie fascinierend die Welt des Streichquartetts sein kann und führen diese Formation aus dem Nischen-Dasein eines immer kleiner werdenden Spezialistenkreises heraus. Kammermusik gehörte ja immer schon zu einem eher esoterischen Bereich der Musik, widerstrebt aller Event-Kultur und ist nicht gerade vom Aussterben, aber doch deutlich von Schwund, an Interesse jedenfalls, betroffen. Hier wird durch das radio.string.quartett ein neuer Bereich erschlossen. Auch für Menschen, die sonst mit dieser Musik weniger vertraut sind, wird diese Version  der Musik zu einer grossen Bereicherung. So dient eine solche CD auch einem Interesse am Streichquartett und, wer weiss, vielleicht hört dann der eine oder andere, irgendwann einmal Shostakovitch oder sogar Schubert."
2,"Alles andere als ein Meilenstein: An ""Port of Call"" ist nichts originell, nichts unterscheidet die Scheibe von tausenden anderen, die bereits erschienen sind. Der Gesang ist zwar präzise (wenn auch für meinen Geschmack etwas zu stark phrasiert und zu hart), holt mich letztlich aber auch nicht hinter dem Ofen hervor. Die Band spielt durchwegs uninspiriert und klinisch. Und als Draufgabe werden zum 1243. Mal diverse Standards bearbeitet und Pop-Klassiker (wie z.B. Stings ""If You Love Somebody Set Them Free"") in Jazz ""umgemodelt"", was mittlerweile auch schon ein alter Hut ist. Das Beste an der CD ist wahrscheinlich noch das Cover - eine nackte Frau (offenbar die Sängerin selbst) - interessant durch Milchglas fotografiert. In Summe Easy-Jazz vom Fließband, dafür spricht auch, daß von Frau Nergaard pro Jahr mindestens eine neue Platte rauskommt..."
5,"Mit der Beatwelle kamen auch viele weibliche Interpreten auf den Plattenmarkt. Das Label ""DERAM"" hat den SechzigerJahre Back-Katalog der Plattenfirma ""DECCA"" durchstöbert und Ende der 90'er Jahre eine CD-Reihe ""The ... Scene"" auf den Markt gebracht (The Beat-Scene, The Blues-Scene usw.). In dieser Reihe werden jede Menge Stars, Sternchen und Eintagsfliegen vorgestellt die in England mal die Möglichkeit hatten irgendwas bei DECCA auf Platte zu veröffentlichen. Hier finden sich auch viele Raritäten."
5,"Das es schwer werden würde, so ein tolles Album wie ""Unverwundbar"" zu toppen, war absehbar. Aber produziert von dem Erfolgsgespann Luis Rodriguez und Amadeus Crotti entstand auch diesmal wieder ein wirklich schönes Album, welches die Weiterentwicklung von Matthias Reim deutlich zum Ausdruck bringt. Die 30-Sek-Hörproben auf der Webseite www.matthiasreim.net lassen erahnen, dass wieder wunderschöne Songs dabei sind. Matthias Reim war und ist ein Musiker, der das Leben in seinen Liedern widerspiegelt. Und so findet man auch hier wieder Songs wie ""Unberechenbar"" (wunderschöner Power-Songs, tolle Gitarristen, hat Ohrwurmcharakter) und ""Gib mein Herz"", welches übrigens auch schon auf der letzten Tour gesungen wurde. Was ich weniger gut finde, ist das Cover. Zum Titel ""Männer sind Krieger"" hätte man sich durchaus etwas besseres einfallen lassen können. Das schmählert jedoch nicht den künstlerischen Wert, deshalb gibts auch von mir 5 Punkte - für einen rockigen Reim, der noch nie ein Stimmungssänger a la Ballermann war."
1,"Wer immer noch nicht eines Besseren belehrt wurde und glaubt, daß E.C. einer der Gitarrengötter schlechthin ist und gute Songs schreibt (na ja ...),der soll doch weiterhin dessen Platten kaufen. Ich werde das nicht tun, denn ich höre mir noch lieber den Blues-Gitarristen aus meiner nächsten Umgebung an, welcher mit Abstand besser und innovativer spielt. E.C., NEIN DANKE !!!"
1,"kenn keine einzige CD (lieber nicht....) denn ich habe ihn als One men show support von gary Moore gesehen: Man muß schon sehr mutig sein, um über Otis taylor etwas positives zu sagen. Und überall steht nur Gutes?????. Die Darbietung war eine schlichte Zumutung. Der Mann kann nicht singen und Gitarre spielen schon gar nicht, obwohl er ein alter Haudegen ist, könnte man ihn als völlig talentfrei bezeichnen !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  . Er hatte schon mal aufgehört, wie ich nachlesen konnte, wäre er bloß dabei geblieben....Das ist noch nicht mal unteres Strassenmusiker-Niveau. Man fragt sich wirklich, auf welcher Basis die überschwengliches Kommentare entstanden sind.Aber vielleicht gibt es ja zwei Otis Taylors :-). Der Typ, den ich gesehen habe,  war nur zum Heulen... man möchte nur noch aufhören, aufhören, aufhören schreien!!!!!!!... das sein Gitarre meistens verstimmt war, störte da schon gar nicht mehr"
1,"Wer Gov't Mule kennt, ist total enttäuscht. Mit der psychedlischen Musik (wahrscheinlich mit sehr viel Dope intus) komme ich überhaupt nicht zurecht. Wer Mule kennt ist total enttäuscht.  Meine Empfehlung: NICHT KAUFEN"
4,"Außer ""You don&amp;#180;t wonna"" war ja nicht allzu viel los auf Trickys letztem Album ""Blow back"". Der Gnurrhahn wirkte extrem zahm. Auf dem neuen Album lässt Tricky auch lieber singen als selber zu murmeln. Allerdings verzichtete er diesmal auf Gaststars. Und bei ""Vulnerable"" hat er zu seiner alten Form zurückgefunden, ohne seine ZuhörerInnen mit Noise/Rap-Gewittern zuzuschütten. Gutes Songwriting, brilliante Produktion, eine neue Sängerin am Start. Und gerade live funktioniert ""Vulnerable"" hervorragend. Monsterbeats und E-Gitarren. Beim ""Rock Werchter"" war Tricky neben vielleicht Metallica der fetteste Rock Act. Sehr schönes Album. Kein Meilenstein wie ""Maxinquaye"", aber dennoch hörenswert."
5,"Das Konzert in Texas, im Rahmen eines Metellica-Konzertes, bietet die richtige Kulisse für Linkin Park. Und sie heizen der Menge auch richtig ein! Was erstaunlich ist; dass die Jungs sich Live genauso wie im Studio anhören (Respekt). Diese DVD ist wirklich stark und kann nicht oft genug gesehen werden. Die Filmaufnahmen sind auch klasse (Aber hier eine kleine Kritik. Auch wenn die Bildumsetzung gut ist, so wirken die ganzen Aufnahmen, durch Zeitraffer, Effekte etc mehr wie Musikvideos als ein Konzert-DVD)."
2,"Ich kaufte mir das neue Linkin Park Album bzw. die Limited Edition, da ich dank Meteora etc. von Linkin Park wirklich guten Stuff gewohnt war. Mit diesem Album wurde ich aber wahrlich enttäuscht. Linkin Park haben ihren Stil stark verändert, waren bei den Vorgänger Alben Lieder wie Numb und In the End Hits, bei denen man mitsingen konnten und die einfach Style hatten, sind die neuen Lieder von Linkin Park meist viel zu tiefgründig und zu ruhig, einfach nicht das, was man von Linkin Park gewohnt ist.  Die einzigen drei Lieder die mir gefallen, sind ""Leave out all the rest"", ""What I've Done"" ""Valentine's Day"", wobei mir bei LOATR bzw. VD jeweils auch nur die Strophen bzw. der Refrain gefällt. Schade!"
2,"Auf dem ersten Blick scheint die Idee interessant zu sein, mit wirklich renommierten Musikern wie Bruford, Levin, McDonald usw. alte Genesis-Titel aus den frühen Siebzigern neu aufzunehmen, dazu etwas Royal Philhamonic Orchestra zur Unterstützung und als Beigabe einige neuere Hackett-Titel im vermeintlich analogem Stil. Aber beim Hören der Doppel-CD fällt schnell auf, daß die Spannung der alten Stücke völlig fehlt. Das Charisma des jungen Peter Gabriel und das rauhe Arrangement der alten Stücke (auch im Zusammenhang der früheren Konzeptalben) kann nicht ersetzt bzw. erreicht werden. Für den Genesis-Liebhaber wird das Hören mancher alten Melodie sicherlich erfreulich sein, aber der hat auch die Originale im CD-Regal stehen und wird diese dann doch bevorzugen."
4,"Mit der  Lovebox scheinen Groove Armada ihren Stil gefunden zu haben. Die Mischung aus tanzbaren Funk-, Soul.- House-,  Hip- hop-, und Chilloutsounds bleibt wie gehabt. Die Experimentierphase  ist aber offensichtlich vorbei. Neu sind lediglich Gitarrensounds die auf der Scheibe untergebracht wurden.  Die genialen Groove Attacken, wie auf der Vertigo sucht man vergebens. Sie sind ein wenig glatter geworden. Die Scheibe ist aber keineswegs langweilig. Beats und Vokalsounds halten sich angenehm die Waage. Die Scheibe bietet eigentlich jeden etwas, der  tanzbare elektronische Musik mag ohne gleich von klirrenden und durchgeknallten, synthetischen  Sound erschlagen zu werden. Aufgrund der Vielfältigkeit wird die Lovebox nie ein  Fehlkauf sein."
5,"Das hätte ich nicht erwartet: noch einmal ein brandneues Hooters Album in meinen Händen zu halten. Ich sah sie in Winterbach ( dort konnte man die CD schon kaufen und ich dachte nicht, dass sie in Europa überhaupt jemals erscheinen würde) zusammen mit Asia und sie haben einen tollen Set gespielt und: die ganze neue CD!! Die neuen songs passen  wunderbar zu den alten, soll heißen: sie sind sehr gut! Das warten hat sich gelohnt: ein erfrischendes Album mit Melodie und abwechslungsreiche Songs. Die Jungs sind die gleichen seit ihrer 2.LP und Hyman und Bazilian liefern ein Topsong nach dem anderen  mit eingängigen Refrains und hohem Wiedererkennungswert nur durch eine sehr gute Coverversion von The Boys of summer von Don Henley unterbrochen. Und die songs sind sogar live noch stärker, da sie an den stärksten Stellen ausgedehnt werden und mit tollen Improvisationen verschönert werden. Fazit: Ein echtes neues Hooters Album, dass meiner Meinung nach das Zweitbeste ihrer Karriere nach One Way Home überhaupt ist."
2,"Tja,so kanns gehen wenn man vom Major geschluckt wird , denn nach zwei sehr gelungenen Alben für Virgin kam dieses dritte Album für den major und damit haben AND ONE ganz schönen Bockmist gebaut. Plötzlich war alles vorbei ,diese wunderbaren Popnummern , vorbei mit dem EBM Touch und vorbei mit den guten Songs einfach! Traurig, aber wahr doch was man hier zu hören bekommt nennt man dann wohl  Popmusik welche absolut belanglos dahinplätschert! Fürs Radio konzipiert und super Glatte songs die niemanden weh tun! Abgesehen von ""Wasted"" und dem Club Hit ""Der Panzermensch"" kann dieses Werk nicht überzeugen und wehmütig denkt man an die alten Alben dieser Band die sich seitdem auch nicht mehr erholen konnte!"
5,"Als Gegner des gewöhnlichen Easy Listening und der üblichen Radio-Musik fühle ich mich bei den Klängen dieser CD absolut heimisch. Stefan Poiss und Markus Hadwiger aus Österreich haben nach ihrem phänomenalen Erstling ""Lost Alone"" aus dem Jahr 2004 und der CD ""Dreamweb"" von 2005 dieses Jahr einen Silberling nachgelegt, der einfach nur pure Freude erzeugt. Die Arrangements sind hier, wie auch schon auf der ersten CD, sehr ausgeklügelt. Vermeintlich künstliche Synthi-Klänge werden hier zu Fleisch und Blut. Ein Kauftipp für mich für diesen Electro-Herbst."
5,"Mit ihrer bereits dritten Single aus dem Comeback Album 'X' setzt uns Kylie einen weiteren Dancefloorkracher in die Ohren, der da auch so schnell nicht wieder rausgeht! Da kommt einfach Sommerfeeling auf. Das prägnante Pianointro und der eingängige Refrain regen zum mitsingen (und tanzen!) an. Klasse!  Weiter so, Kylie!"
1,"Für Limp Bizkit hat es schon lange gedauert, bis sie das vorliegende Album veröffentlichen konnten. Zuerst zog Gitarrist Wes Borland, der allgemein hin als die treibende musikalische Kraft der Band angesehehn wurde, bei Limp Bizkit das Kabel aus dem Verstärker und ging seinen eigenen Weg. Dann wurde mit viel Brimborium (für einen Selbstdarsteller wie Fred Durst die angemessene Methode) ein USA-weiter Talentwettbewerb veranstaltet, bei dem dann der neue Gitarrist ermittelt werden sollte. Das ging offensichtlich ganz schön in die Hose, denn letztendlich präsentierte man Mike Smith, der früher bei Snot spielte, als neuen Mann.  Dann konnte endlich mit den Aufnahmen begonnen werden. Als Produzent wurde der legendäre Rick Rubin verpflichtet, Hoffnungen nach ungewöhnlichen Ergebnissen waren also nicht unberechtigt. Doch daraus wurde nichts. Die Aufnahmen wurden kurzerhand verworfen. Das gleiche dann nochmal beim nächsten Versuch. Außerdem standen mehrere Albumtitel zur Auswahl. Anfangs ""Bipolar"", dann sickerte der stimmige Titel ""Panty Sniffer"" durch."
5,"..Platte, die ich mir da bestellt habe...:-) Nein, im Ernst. Ich wäre natürlich nie auf diese Foxboro Hottubes Platte gestoßen, wenn ich nicht irgendwo gelesen hätte, wer nun wirklich hinter diesem Projekt steckt... Man hört jedem Song dieser Platte an, dass die Herren - Armstrong, Wright und Pritchard - immensen Spaß beim Aufnehmen dieser Platte haben mussten... Die Platte ist absolut Club- wie Party tauglich, und wird noch viele zufällige Zuhörer für sich gewinnen können, die dann aber sehr erstaunt sein werden, dass die großen Green Day hinter diesem Projekt stehen. Obwohl: Billies Stimme ist auch auf dieser Platte sehr markant....! Kurz und gut: Ich finde die Platte großartig, vor allem auch aus musikalischer Sicht!!!! Weiter so..."
5,Brian Littrell bringt nun nach Nick Carter als zweiter Backstreet Boy ein SoloAlbum auf den Markt. Die 11 Lieder sind alle im typischen Sound der BsB-Balladen. Allerdings haben alle Texte einen religiösen Inhalt. Brians Stimme passt sehr gut zu den wunderschönen Balladen! Einfach eine sehr schöne CD!
2,"Kann mich meinen Vorgängern nur anschließen: Das 2te Album verliert mehr an Eigenständigkeit, als es beim ersten der Fall war. Der Bezug zu Tomte ist unverkennlich, nicht nur musikalisch. Das einzige Highlight, welches ich entdecken kann, ist zweifelsohne die Singleauskopplung. Warten wir aufs dritte Album und hoffen, dass es wieder mehr in Richtung ""Madsen"" geht."
1,"Ich gebe es zu, ich bin Kettcar-Neuling. Aufmerksam geworden auf die Band bin ich durch ""Graceland"" welches ich im Radio hörte. Dann lies ich mir die überwiegend psoitiven Rezensionen hier zum aktuellen Album durch und legte mir das Album schließlich zu. Das Album geht ja auch dann gleich mit meinem Anfütterer ""Graceland"" los und was kam dann ? Abgrundtiefe Entäuschung ! Was ist das denn ? Blindes, belangloses Gitarrengeschrammel und ein schlechter Sänger den man nicht verstehen kann. Will man die Texte wahrnehmen, müßte man immer das Booklet zur Hand haben. Aber mal ehrlich Jungs und Mädels: Will man dieses Pseudointerlektuelle Genöle wirklich verstehen ? Nachdem ich mich mit den Texten beschäftigt habe, kam zumindestens die Überzeugung das es doch besser ist das man sie nicht hören kann.  Wenn ich schon Geld für Musik ausgebe, erwarte ich zumindestens davon unterhalten zu werden und nicht mit belanglosem Wichtiggetue auf Schülerbandniveau abgefrühstückt zu werden. Ich weiß, die Kettcar Liebhaber werden sicher angesichts meiner Worte aufschreien und unterstellen ich würde die Band nicht verstehen. Aber das ist mitnichten so, ich finde sie einfach nur schlecht ! ..von daher....Kettcar.....nee lass man gut sein Jungs...Ja das Leben ist schwer.... Ach ja noch was: Lasst auf der ltd. Edition bitte den Sticker in Form von ""ltd.Edition mit Bonus DVD und Poster"" sein. Was findet sich in der CD ? Ein Gutschein auf dem man sich sein Poster bei einem Konzert abholen kann. Dreister gehts ja nicht, oder ?"
5,"2-raum-wohnung übertrift sich wieder mal selbst, daß album knüpft an das vorige an und besticht mit süßer stimme, coolem disko sound und viel liebe im detail. ""wer die erste geil fand, steht auch auf dies album !"""
5,"Diese CD nimmt in der Schaffensphase der Toten Hosen eine gewisse Sonderstellung ein. Sie steht rein musikalisch genau zwischen dem frühen Treiben der 80er Jahre und den neueren Veröffentlichungen nach ""Kauf mich"". Somit klingt sie auch ein wenig anders als die übrigen Alben. Sie ist sorgfältiger und hochwertiger arrangiert und produziert als die vorherigen und dabei trotzdem noch wesentlich rotziger und punkiger als die neuen Sachen. Auch textlich unterscheidet sich ""Ein kleines bisschen Horrorschau"" von den anderen Werken. Das liegt zum Einen natürlich daran, dass (wie hier schon mehrmals erwähnt) zum größten Teil die Vertonung des Kultfilms ""Clockwork Orange"" vorliegt, zum Anderen dass hier völlig auf die (sonst für die Band ja auch typischen) Spass- und Partylieder verzichtet wurde. Für mich war die Platte damals der Anstoss mich näher mit Musik auseinander zu setzen und meinen eigenen Geschmack zu ergründen. Eines der wichtigsten Alben der deutschen Rockmusikgeschichte!!!"
4,"Gleich vorweg: ich hätte auch 5 Sterne vergeben, aber die Texte sind teilweise nicht überzeugend. Und auch die gehören zu einer richtig guten Platte. Sei's drum, die Musik hat jedenfalls 5 Sterne verdient, denn die ist un unserer heutigen Musikwelt mit ihren 3 Minuten Popnummern um Klassen besser als (fast) alles im Jahr 2006 gehörte. Insgesamt nur 7 Songs bei rund 50 Minuten Laufzeit? Nun denn, für Improvisation ist also genügend Zeit. Und das nutzen Kante ausgiebig. ""Die Tiere sind unruhig"" ist ein guter Opener, mit einem (in diesem Song) richtig guten Text und einer gewissen Ohrwurmqualität, die allerdings nie zu kommerziell wirkt. Dann der Übersong ""Ich hab's gesehn"". Dieser rechtfertigt allein schon die Investition in diese CD. Mein Gott, Wahnsinn...... Es geht sehr rockig weiter. Dann kommt ein Instrumental: ""Ducks &amp; Dawns"", jazzig, experimentell, improvisiert, kurz gesagt, einfach nur genial. Eine wunderschöne Ballade runder die CD ab (Die Hitze dauert an), man bleibt verblüfft sitzen und weiss: ""Zombie"" war sehr gut, ""Die Tiere sind unruhig"" allerdings auch. Nichts wäre ungerechter als die beiden Platten zu sehr miteinander zu vergleichen. Kante entwickeln sich auf sehr hohem Niveau weiter. Und das ist sehr gut so."
2,"Kurz und knapp: Wir reden hier natürlich in DT Relationen ! Aber diese Scheibe ist echt langweilig. Es klingt so, als wären da im Proberaum zufällig paar schöne Melodien aus den Instrumenten gefallen, aber mehr nicht. Insgesamt simpel, eintönig und abgenuddelt. Da war wohl vertraglich einfach nur wieder ein Album gefordert. Naja, aber auch DT werden mal alt und haben wahrscheinlich auch irgendwann mal keine Lust mehr. Für mich als Gitarrist und großen DT Fan eine reine Geldmache der Produzenten und eine große Enttäuschung ! Meine Meinung..."
5,"Als ich die CD das erste Mal gehört hatte, dachte ich: Was ist das denn? Das ist doch nicht Atb!Nach dem zweiten Hören gewöhnte ich mich an die Klänge. Obwohl ""No Silence"" nicht so durchgängig wie der Vorgänger ""Addicted to Music"" ist, entwickelte es seinen besonderen Charme bei mir nach dem dritten Hören. Wie schon in der Amazon-Rezension gesagt, gefallen auch mir Track 8 und 9 nicht wirklich. Aber alles andere kann sich auf jeder Sommer-Party sehen lassen: Marrakech überzeugt mit einem Orient-Touch, der einen nicht mehr loslässt. Und Ecstasy und Here with me sind Ohrwürmer, passend als nächste Single. Die Tracks 3,5,7 und 11 bis 13 sorgen für Chill-Out-Feeling vom Feinsten. Die mitgelieferte DVD überzeugt nicht wirklich. Das ""Making of"" ist lustig und gut gemacht, das Video von ""Marrakech"" und der Trailer von Mindhunters gefallen mir auch. Die Remixe laufen mit nicht so schönem Hintergrund, da hätte ich mir wenigstens eine Bilderkulisse im Hintergrund gewünscht. Die Qualität der Photos ist auch nicht soo berauschend. Aber alles in allem lässt mich diese CD - wie alle von Atb - nicht mehr los. Und dass der kommerzielle Touch so langsam verschwindet und Atb zu seinen Wurzeln zurückkehrt, freut ungemein :)"
1,"ATB's nunmehr dritte Mixcompilation ist wieder einmal klasse geworden. Super Trackauswahl und perfektes mixing. Zudem bleibt er seinem Stil treu, die erste CD ein wenig schneller und tranciger zu mixen, und die zweite ein wenig ruhiger und progressiver."
5,"Ich bin ein begeisterter Fan von Mozarts Oper ""Le Nozze di Figaro"" und besitze mehrere Versionen auf CD. Doch von all denen ist dies eine meiner Favoriten. Kiri Te Kanawa als Gräfin verleitet einem zum träumen wenn sie ihre ""Porgi Amor"" Arie singt und auch Lucia Popps Stimme, die ""Susanna"", ist grandios. Alle Stimmen harmonieren wunderbar mit Mozarts Musik und man kann sich regelrecht ein Bild zu den glasklaren Tönen bilden. Einfach klasse!"
5,"Aufnahmen wie diese können ein Leben verändern. Ich bin mir sicher dass es kein Mensch gibt der unbewegt von dem ganzen Ausfluss an Gefühlen von dieser Aufnahme bleiben kann. Calls fand Tosca als nicht so interessante Gestalt wie z. B. Violetta , wahrscheinlich weil alles auf dem Blatt ist, man kann nicht soviel interpretieren. Und doch ist auf dem Blatt zu viel und ermöglichteine Explosion an Gefühlen, Singen, Musikalität, Inteligenz, Weiblichkeit. Die Stimme der Callas ist nie besser geklungen, ein perfektes Instrument, das nich nur spielt sondern auch spricht und fühlt. Neben Callas ist auch deSAbata in Höchstform. Der Maestro schafft unglaublichen Releph der Atmosphäre. Tito Gobbi ist wie immer wunderbar und Distefano schafft unkonventionelle Charaketrzüge seiner Figur zu geben. Ein muss. Ohne diese Aufnahme kann keiner Opernfan leben."
2,"Als Nachfolger des unter Fans umstrittenen „Black Album"" hatte „Load"" 1996 von Anfang an keinen leichten Stand in der Metallica-Fangemeinde, war es doch noch einmal eine Spur weicher und eingängiger als das schwarze Album."
2,"Ich will mich kurz fassen: Eigentlich gefällt mir die härtere Musik von Metallica besser, als das was man auf Load und ReLoad zu hören bekommt. Ich bin einer von denen, die von dieser Platte stark enttäuscht sind, da ich mir eher wieder einen Sound, der den ersten 4-5 Alben gleicht gewünscht hätte. Thrash eben. Aber um es neutral zu betrachen: Ich denke das Album ist an sich nicht schlecht. Es ist sogar sehr gut, wenn man nicht mit der Erwartung herangeht Thrash-Metal hören zu wollen. Für Leute die gerne Hardrock hören wie zB. Bon Jovi, Aerosmith usw. dürfte das Album sehr gut sein. Also wie gesagt: Nichts für Metaller (und Metallica-Fans), aber für Hard-(und teilweise auch Soft-)rocker"
2,"wer hier eine Fortsetzung von seinem ersten Album sucht, wird hier groß enttäuscht! das ist nicht der alte Paolo, das ist ein neuer. was hast du dir nur dabei gedacht?ich fand dein ersten album klasse und jetzt so was!!!wer diese cd kauft, wird eine mischung aus cat stevens,new orleans jazz und country finden,aber nichts was mit dem ersten album zu tun hat. vielleicht gehört es zu den alben, die man lieben lernt, jedoch bin ich noch so enttäuscht davon, nachdem ich zwei jahre darauf gewartet habe, dass ich es zur zeit noch nicht wieder hören möchte und 1000 mal lieber mir das alte album noch mal anhöre!!!die enttäuschung des jahres, für mich persönlich!!!"
1,"Dieses Album ist einfach nur schwach es ist nicht das was man von Nickelback gewöhnt ist. Es gibt auf dem ganzem Album gerade mal 2 richtig gute Titel und das sind ""Someday"" und ""Feelin way to damn good"" der Rest ist eher eintönig und nichts besonderes (was man von Nickelback eigentlich nicht gewöhnt ist). Also ich rate jedem die 15€ lieber andersweitig zu investieren, sie lohnen sich nicht für dieses Album. Kaum ein Song bleibt einem im Ohr hängen und keiner animiert so richtig zum mitsummen. Ich bin der Meinung Nickelback hätte sich mit dem Album ein bisschen mehr Zeit lassen sollen. Es kommt mir nämlich so vor als hätten die Jungs einfach noch nicht genügend neue Ideen gehabt fürs neue Album."
5,"Thus album is an innovative release that proved that David Bowie had much more to offer than Ziggy Stardust; every song is strong and touches a chord; this album led modern music down a different path - a gift that David Bowie seems to have, to the benefit of his many fans worldwide. The man is, simply, a genius!"
2,"Unter den späteren Motörheadalben steht dieses Exemplar in großem Kontrast zu Overnight Sensation. Während letzteres Album noch auf gute vier Sterne kam, reicht es hier nur für zwei. Gründe dafür sind folgende: Es geht los mit dem druckreichen Killersong ""Terminal Show"", der auch der beste Titel des Albums bleibt. Der Rest ist ein relativ eintöniger, E-lastiger Brei bei schleppendem bis schnellem Tempo, wobei ""Fight"" wieder ein wenig belebt. Den Songs mangelt es diesmal an Charakter und man braucht wirklich kein großer Kenner zu sein um zu merken, daß man die meisten nie wieder live hören wird. Ich würde sagen, Mötorhead wäre besser beraten gewesen, auf dieses Album zu verzichten, das insgesamt recht monoton und völlig unkreativ daherkommt. Das größte Problem ist Langeweile: Diese Platte nimmt man wohl nicht sehr oft aus dem Regal, nachdem man die Songs einige Male durchgehört hat. Will man ein schnelles Album, ist Snake Bite Love der richtige Griff, steht man auf Melodiöses, Kreatives, dann ist Overnight Sensation zu empfehlen (sowieso einer der besten Alben!). Inferno ist okay, aber eben nur das; letzten Endes ein Album, daß ""auf die Schnelle"" produziert wurde."
4,"Mit ihrem letzten Werk Hot Fuss schlug die Band um Sänger Brandon Flowers letztendlich mit Verzögerung auch im immer etwas Rock-launigen Deutschland ein wie eine Bombe.  Dabei musste sich manch einer beim Lesen der Banddaten die Augen reiben, denn wer erwartet eine derart knackige Rockband gerade aus der Stadt, die in Bezug auf Glitzer und Oberflächlichkeit weltweit wohl seinesgleichen sucht: Die Rede ist natürlich von Las Vegas. Doch vielleicht hat das vitale Zentrum der glamourösen Unterhaltung ja doch seine Spuren hinterlassen? Denn bei allen knalligen Gitarren und eingängigen Songs fordern The Killers auch auf Sams Town wieder zum einen oder anderen Tänzchen auf, denn manches grooved und ist so gar nicht geradlinig öde wie man es leider immer wieder von Gitarrenrockbands hört. Widmet man sich dem neuen Werk allerdings häufiger, stellt man eine Veränderung fest: Beim Songwriting hat man offensichtlich eine neue Entwicklungsstufe erklommen, alles ist etwas weniger eingängig als beim Vorläufer, dafür aber umso tiefer gehend. Geht doch."
2,"Die ernsthaften Heino-Fans mögen mir meine mit breitem Grinsen auf den Lippen geschriebene Rezension verzeihen, aber diese CD schaffte ich mir wirklich nur zum Heben der Stimmung bierseliger Jugendpartys an. Heino ist ohne Zweifel deutscher Kult, aber eben auch gesegnet mit einem nicht zu unterschätzenden Trashfaktor. Wenn eine ganze Runde sich in den Armen liegender Teenies ""Blau blüht der Enzian"" anstimmt, bleibt wahrlich kein Auge trocken! Vieles, was man Heino in der Vergangenheit bezüglich des Singens zumindestens umstrittenen Liedguts vorgeworfen hat, soll nicht an dieser Stelle ausdiskutiert werden. Fakt ist aber offenbar, dass der gelernte Konditor oftmals wenig Fingerspitzengefühl bei der Auswahl seines Repertoires und seiner Auftrittsorte bewies. Da Meister Kramm stets nur von anderen Autoren geschriebene Musik interpretierte, kann man ihn nicht unbedingt für den Inhalt verantwortlich machen. Was für absurde Blüten sich da allerdings gerade im textlichen Bereich ansammelten, dafür steht ""Karamba, Karacho, ein Whisky"" wie in Stein gemeißelt. Kostprobe gefällig? Da sitzt in Rio de Janeiro (also in Brasilien) ein braungebrannter Gaucho (die man nur mit viel Augenzudrücken NICHT mit Argentinien assoziiert), flucht auf spanisch in einem portugiesischsprachigen Land zum Wirt (der passenderweise einen italienischen Vornamen trägt), bestellt landesuntypischen Fusel und alles wird untermalt von prima argentinischen Tango-Rhythmen. Ganz großer Sport! Aufgrund des Partyfaktors keine Tiefstwertung. Bier bestellen nicht vergessen!"
1,"Selbst ein Weltstar wie die Streisand darf einmal danebenhauen und hier hat sie dies eindeutig. 4 lange Jahre nach ""A love like ours"" kam dieses Album, voll klassischer Filmsongs des letzten Jahrhunderts. Obwohl das Konzept Grundstein für eine hochinteressante CD bilden könnte, wurden die Chancen leider nicht genutzt. Träge Arrangements schleppen sich von Titel zu Titel und das begleitet mit einer besorgniserregend brüchigen Stimme. Lediglich ""Moon river"" hebt sich mit einer sehr gefühlvollen Interpretation deutlich hervor und auch in ""You're gonna hear from me"" wird sangestechnisch noch einmal alles gegeben. Nur leider tragen 2 gute Nummern keine ganze Platte und deshalb gehört ""The movie album"" zweifelsfrei ans untere Ende des umfangreichen Streisand-Katalogs."
1,"Die Orginale sind allemal Besser! Das Summer Wine gedudel geht einem schon nach dem 1.Mal auf die Nerven, auch hier gilt: Nancy &amp; Lee sind nicht zu Toppen. Wer den Film gesehen hat fragt sich was soll diese CD...genau, es ist die Vortsetzung der Langeweile. Uschi Obermaier ist und war nie mein Geschmack, zu viel bla bla bla und immer die gleichen Geschichten, mit wem sie es wann, wie und wo getrieben hat und wieviel Alk/Drugs dabei im Spiel waren.  Diese CD kann man getrost im Regal stehen lassen man verpasst nichts. Wo bleiben die Wilden 60iger Jahre? nicht auf dieser CD da gibt es bessere Soundtracks oder die Originale von: J.Hendrix, Stones, MC5, Canned Heat u.v.a."
2,"Ja, auch ich fand Uschi damals toll, aber welcher Junge nicht. Auch mit 60 noch eine wunderbare Frau, aber warum muss sie jetzt ihr Leben so vermarkten? Ihr Leben mit einer FSK-Freigabe von 12 Jahren, da kann ja schon etwas nicht stimmen und nicht nur der Film, auch die Musik enttäuscht die Erwartungen. Einfach nicht wild genug, zuwenig Hendrix und Stones, zuviel ""Summer Wine""....und auch da war das Original einfach besser (Lee Hazlewood &amp; Nancy Sinatra). Chance vertan auf einen wilden Film und Soundtrack!"
4,"Drei Jahre haben wir in Sachen neues Album nichts mehr von Moloko gehört. Dabei haben die sich ganz tief ins Musikzentrum des Stammhirns eingebrannt - man muss nur ihren grossen Hit ""Sing it back"" einmal kurz anspielen und schon klingelt es wieder in den Ohren und juckt im Tanzbein. Das hat ja die ganze Welt einen Sommer lang rauf und runter gehört, das sitzt immer noch! Soeben ist das neue Album von Moloko rausgekommen, es heisst ""Statues"". Gebt mir mehr davon! Dieses Album öffnet den Himmel! Ok, diese vielseitige CD überwältigt einen nicht beim ersten Hören, macht aber sofort abhängig. Und dann packst Du sie gleich wieder in den Player und willst wissen: was macht mich da eigentlich so an: Und irgendwann hast Du's raus: Alles! Die Musik, die Texte, die ganze Austrahlung dieser Band."
1,"Bei uns im Büro läuft im Hintergrund Radio und wir wechseln bei diesem Lied immer den Sender. Auch mir fällt für dieses Lied nur der Begriff nervtötend ein. Ganz, ganz furchtbar."
5,Ich find das Album echt richtig gut!
1,"Also die anderen Alben hatte ich anders in Erinnerung! Sorry, ich bin Avrilfan und mag ihre Musik wirklich, aber das Album jetzt hätte sie sich klemmen können! Sie erinnert mich ein wenig an ein pubertierendes Kind als eine erwachsene Frau! Ich mag ihre neuen Songs nicht! Hätte mir gewünscht reifere Sachen zu hören! Ausserdem ist es immer wieder das Gleiche! Wir wissen entzwischen, dass der Typ nur dich will und niemanden sonst, aber das du ihn nicht willst! Sorry Avril! Sorry Avrilfans, war nur meine Meinung!"
5,"Hallo liebe Leser.. ich machs diesmal kurz.... wer die Vorgänger CDs von Dido mag, wird auch das neue Album von ihr lieben, in meinem Player läufts rauf und runter, es ist nicht wirklich ein Track dabei, der scheiße ist. Zudem sind noch 4 kleine Postkarten in schwarz /weiß dabei, die super aussehen, und zusätzlich ist ein 10 min. Film in english zu sehen, der auf jedem Pc abgespielt werden können sollte. Da bekommt man zusätzlich noch Hintergrund Infos... also, alles in Allem ein Super geiles Teil, mir persönlich hätte es noch mehr gefallen, wenn die aktuelle Single noch als Video Clip dabei gewesen wäre. Also... ich kann nur sagen : kaufen!!! Vielen Dank für s lesen."
2,"ich habe mir dieses album mit einer gewissen erwartung angehört, nämlich gute musik zu hören, die anspruch vielleicht als eigenschaft hat.  leider wurde ich reglich enttäuscht. dieses album hat bis auf ein paar segmente in den liedern nichts was mir sagt, hör es dir ein drittes mal an. es ist wirklich schwach und von rock gar nicht die rede. es ist purer schwacher pop der halt ein bisserl vom genre rock angehaucht ist."
5,"""Long Live Rock'n'Roll"" - der Name ist Programm und was die Herren Blackmore, Powell, Dio, Stone und Daisley mit diesem Album präsentierten ist ein Stück Rockgeschichte und machte die Trilogie perfekt. Nie wieder erreichte die Band nur annähernd diese Kreativität, denn es war zugleich das letzte Album mit dem genialen Köpfen Blackmore, Powell und Dio. Ronnie war und bleibt die einzig wahre Rainbow-Stimme und der mittlerweile leider tödlich verunglückte Cozy war eine Koryphäe am Schlagzeug."
5,"Also als ich ,,Drama Queen`` das erste mal gehört habe, war ich einfach nur sprachlos! Das ist ein absolut geiler Song! Vany hat einfach das Talent dafür, so coole Song's zu schreiben! Wir können uns ja sicher noch alle an den Nr. 1 Hit ,,Something about as`` von den ,,No Angels`` erinnern! Den hat auch die Vany geschrieben und das ist auch ein super klasse Song! Also von mir bekommt sie die volle Punktzahl! Der Song wierd sicher hoch in den Charts sein, dass garantiere ich euch!"
1,Ich finde diese CD ist eine Mischung aus schnulzigem Pop und langweiligem Studiomix. LANGWEILIG.
2,"Ich kann die musik von den A*teens nicht ausstehen!Das sind 4 achtzehnjährige Girls und Boys die gezwungen werden kitschigen Kindergarten Pop zu singen!FURCHTBAR!!!Zum Glück haben die sich jetzt aufgelöst und jeder einzelne macht jetzt ""richtige Musik"""
2,"Wolfang Ambros singt Moser - dazu Christian Kolonovits als geistiger Geburtshelfer und Produzent sowie das Wiener Ambassade Orchester als musikalische Begleitung: Dieser Mix war kaum zu übertrumpfen und versprach eine Sternstunde der österreichischen Populärmusik. Doch leider wurde hier eine einmalige Chance vertan. Die Rhythmen sind stampfend und schwerfällig. Unser aller Wolferl Ambros hat im Heurigenlokal jeden Humor an der Garderobe abgegeben. Der Schmäh, die Verschleppung, die hintergründige Abgefeimtheit der alten Texte und Lieder wurde eingeflacht. Wo Swing mit dem Schwanzerl wackeln sollte, trottet das Ambassade Orchester brav vorwärts. Auch hätte es möglich sein sollen, bei einem derartigen Prestigeprojekt noch andere Gastsänger als immer nur Rainhard Fendrich zu gewinnen. Wien ist voller begnadeter Künstler. Das böse Auge auf Abgründe und dazu umwerfender Witz gehören zu den Kardinaltugenden in der Donaustadt. Wo sind sie hier? Wo eine Ulrike Beimpold, die flotte Burgschauspielerin, im Gesang? Wo Mo, Hubertus, Kurt Ostbahn und mit ihnen Duette im Schlagerstar-Himmel? Die Meisterschaft, die Ambros und Kolonovits sonst aus dem Ärmel schütteln, hat sie hier verlassen. Auch das Ambassade Orchester will da nichts retten. Wolfang Ambros, ein Brüderl Bleifuß im Moser Heurigenkeller."
2,"Also ich bin sehr enttäuscht von dieser Platte. Jedes Lied klingt wie das andere und vom Sänger kann man auch nicht viel erwarten. Das beste Lied ist das erste Lied was sie ausgekoppelt haben und somit ""berühmt"" geworden sind. Die restlichen Lieder haben dieselbe Leier die sie abspielen und da kann man etwas mehr erwarten. Sorry, das ist meine Meinung."
1,"Ich kann nur allen empfehlen, lasst die Finger von diesem ALbum. Wer die alten Adema Scheiben liebt kann hier nur enttäuscht werden. Rein gar nichts hört sich mehr nach dem typischen Adema-Sound an. Und der war zweifelslos genial. Für die, die Adema nicht kennen und sich dieses Album als Erstscheibe zulegen wollen, kann ich nur sagen: Kauft euch lieber die alten CD`s."
5,"Besser als Creed sollten sie sein, war das was ich wußte bevor ich das Debüt von Alter Bridge ""One Day remains"" kaufte. Und dieser steilen These wurden sie dann auch gerecht. Eine entfesselte Rockgitarre, wie man ihresgleiches heutzutage selten findet, und eine emotionale sehr origniell Stimme sorgen dafür, dass diese Scheibe zum absoluten Rockgenuss wird.  Diese Musik ist der absolute Wahnsinn, beim Hören wähnt man sich im Rock-Himmel. Feinster Breitrock der einen an Freiheit denken läßt."
5,"..die Songs sind ganz im Stil von Kylies ""cant get u out of my head"" und die Stimme passt perfekt dazu.  Wer von Kylie enttäuscht ist, der wird hier gut bedient. Von allen 3 Alben ist dieses hier das Beste. Vielleicht wird ja cry for you aus dem 2.ten Album bei uns nochmal ausgekoppelt und ein Hit. Auf dem 3-ten Album dancing shoes ist schon mal die ge-remixte Version drauf. Dancefloor vom Feisten..wer sylver und lasgo vermisst: Kaufen!"
5,"Eines der schönsten Musikalben, die es je gab von einer der besten Bands, wenn nicht sogar der besten unserer Zeit. Ich kann dieses Album nur höchstens empfehlen, gleiches gilt auch für Affirmation und auch ein Blick auf die KonzertDVD lohnt sich. Diese Band ist eine der wenigen die sich live mindestens genauso gut anhört wie im Studio."
1,"diese zappa hat mit trance so wenig zu tun wie bayern münchen mit unglück ! gar nix ! ein fürchterliches gefrickel an allen plätzen dieser scheibe ! ich höre jetzt erst mal man from utopia und anschließend klaus schulzes dune. ich bin mir absolut sicher, daß man zappa durchaus mit trance mixen könnte aber dieser etikettenschwindel muß aufhören !!!!!"
5,"Nach all den Jahren und all seinen CDs lässt Stings Qualität als Songschreiber in keinster Weise nach. Mit dieser CD veröffentlichte Sting damals ein fantastisches Album, das in der heutigen Zeit noch seinesgleichen sucht, meiner Meinung nach aber ohnehin nur noch durch ihn selbst übertrumpft werden kann. Meine Lieblingshits sind ""Fields of Gold"", ""Heavy Cloud, No Rain"" und ""Seven Days"". Nichtsdestotrotz sind die anderen Songs auch alle klasse, was diese CD zu einem Muss für jeden Hörer macht, der auch das Jazzige an Sting mag."
5,"Der Song passt optimal zu ""unserer"" WM - er geht ins Ohr und macht Lust auf die Spielübertragungen (ich gehöre leider nicht zu den Glücklichen, die über Eintrittskarten verfügen). Und nichts anderes als einen doppeltdeutigen Titel hätte ich von Herbert erwartet. Wer sich nichts dabei denken mag, hat auch so seine Freude an dem Song. Und wer sich zum Nachdenken inspirieren lässt, wird herzlich eingeladen. Zeit, dass sich was dreht!"
4,"Eins vorweg : Für alle Fans von IC Falkenberg eine klare Kaufempfehlung! Ich persönlich finde die CD und die Lieder gelungen, wenn auch nicht ganz so gut wie z.B. ""Eine Nacht"". Die Titel überzeugen, vor allem fantastische wie ""Das Alles"" oder ""Bedingungslos lieben"". Allerdings halte ich 2 Stücke, und zwar ""Tiefenrauschen"" und ""Turm"" schlichtweg für überflüssig. Bei diesen hat Falkenberg mit elektronischen Klängen experimentiert, singt dabei allerdings nicht. Sehr schade wie ich finde, denn so verkürzt sich die Laufzeit (ohne die beiden genannten Titel) auf knappe 40 Minuten. Die übrigen Lieder machen das dafür mehr als wett. Es ist auch weiterhin ein Genuss IC Falkenberg zu lauschen.  Personen, die IC Falkenberg noch nicht gehört haben, empfehle ich ein anderes Album, in ""So Nah vom Nächsten Meer"" experimentiert er viel und zeigt gelegentlich nicht die ""üblichen"" Klänge, die man von ihm gewohnt ist. Generell würde ich dem Album 5 Sterne geben, die gesungenen Stücke sind wie immer erstklassig, aber 2 Titel enttäuschen und ich empfinde Falkenbergs neueste Kreation dadurch als zu kurz. Deshalb ""nur"" 4 Sterne. Die Lieferzeit von 4-6 Wochen ist übrigens Unsinn, bei mir wurde es in 3 Tagen geliefert, das sollte Amazon besser noch ändern. Ich habe auch lange gezögert - wer möchte schon einen Monat warten?"
1,"Von Vermarktung versteht André Rieu sehr viel. Weshalb dieses Produkt unter ""Musik"" rubriziert ist, versteh ich nicht, denn mit Musik hat dies alles nur sehr wenig zu tun. Noten werden gespielt, dass ja, aber es gleicht Fussball in den Vereinigten Staaten: es dient nicht dem Sport oder der Musik sondern dem Mammon. Dass so viele Leute darauf immer wieder reinfallen verwundert mich sehr."
5,"...Aber nichts für die,die Goldsmiths Musik aus First Contact oder anderen Star Trek Filmen gwöhnt sind und diese Musik und nichts anderes wollen.Ich hab die CD inzwischen sehr lieb gewonnen,allerdings bin ich am Anfang ein wenig verwirrt gewesen,denn die Musik ist etwas ""eigenartig"".Doch bei mehrmaligem hinhören war ich doch recht begeistert.Doch Achtung!Die auf dieser CD vorhandenen Songs entsprechen genau denen aus Caretaker.Man könnte sagen es ist alles genau wie in Caretaker,nur das man keinen sprechen hört und das die Musik nicht im Hintergrund und mit geringer,sondern im Vordergrund und mit sehr hoher Qualität läuft."
2,"Krypteria ist eine (vom Produzenten und Hauptsongwriter) zusammengecastete Band, das bestreiten nicht mal die Mitglieder selbst. An sich wäre das auch kein Problem, nur klingt auch das Songmaterial schlicht und einfach zusammengestöpselt: kurzes Intro - leise Strophe, dann knallender Refrain (vornehmlich immer mit denselben Akkorden). Die Produktion ist makellos, superfett und transparent und auch die (Studio)musiker überzeugen, wenn sie mal, für einige Sekunden, dürfen. Insgesamt ist BloodangelŽs Cry aber zu flach und zu platt. Sicher, super gemacht, aber ohne Substanz - und vor allem - ohne Credibility. Vergleiche mit Nightwish und Within Temptation braucht man hier aber wirklich nicht zu ziehen, Krypteria klingen völlig anders und sollten auch nicht mit diese beiden Bands verglichen werden. Eher noch mit einer zahmen Version von Evanescence zu vergleichen, wobei die Amis klar die Nase vorne haben."
2,"...mit seiner neuen Gitarre wären besser dageblieben wo sie herkamen: in seinem Heimstudio. Erstaunlich an diesem Album ist allenfalls die Tatsache daß ein Gitarrist seines Formats den Nerv hat, diese dahingeklimperten  Impressionen zu veröffentlichen. Als Blick in Methenys Werkstatt geht die Platte durch, musikalisch führt das abgesehen vom schönen Klang der Baritongitarre nirgendwo hin. Metheny ist eine hybride Persönlichkeit - bedenkt man daß diese Aufnahmen und der brachiale Lätrm von ""Zero tolerance for silence"" von ein- und derselben Person stammen. Allerdings gelingt es ihm nicht diese Strömungen zusammenzuführen. So wird die nächste Klangexplosion vermutlich dann erneut folgen wenn ihm sein Wohlfühlsound mal wieder selbst zum Hals heraushängt."
1,"‚Speaking of Now' verdient zwischen 3 und 4 Sternen. Für Metheny Neueinsteiger sind es 4, für Kenner nur 3. Es ist der bekannte Metheny ohne rechte Überraschungen, die auf früheren CDs öfter mal in die Hose gingen. Aber gerade das Fehlen dieser unliebsamen Überraschungen machen die CD gerade hörenswert. Tempomat einschalten und mit der CD einfach entspannt reisen."
5,"Als dieses Album ca. 1968 herauskam, wussten die Stones-Fans wenig damit anzufangen - entsprach es doch überhaupt nicht dem ""harten"" Image der Band. So ""weich"" und melodiös waren die Stones weder vorher noch nachher je wieder zu hören. Mick Jagger singt berührend und verführerisch sanft, die Arrangements sind verspielt, zart und ruhig und die Texte voller Sehnsucht und kunstvoll. Es ist das einzige experimentell-psychodelische Album der Band. (Die Fünf hatten damals alle möglichen Schwierigkeiten wegen Drogenkonsum am Hals und landeten für einige Zeit auch im Gefängnis.) Die Rolling Stones selbst betrachteten diese LP eher als Irrweg - aber was für eine schöne Verirrung in einem Zaubergarten wunderbarer Musik !"
1,"sorry, aber das ist die schlechteste ballermann hits der letzten jahre. wo kommen denn all diese komischen titel her die da drauf sind. soll hier der kunde evtl abgezockt werden???wenn das so weitergeht nei wieder."
2,"Nach dem starken ""Tug of War"" folgte ein so nicht erwarteter Tiefpunkt: ""Pipes of Peace"" ist eine Zusammenstellung aus Resten,die es nicht auf den Vorgänger schafften (zurecht!),sowie belanglosem neuen Material,wie z.B. dem Titelsong. Insgesamt aalglatter Pop (Say Say Say!) ohne jeglichen Tiefgang. Die 2. Hälfte kann man komplett vergessen. Kurios,dass sich der um Welten bessere Nachfolger, ""Press to Play"" deutlich schlechter verkaufte!"
4,"Linkin Park ist bekannt geworden durch ihre sehr rockigen Lieder. Das neuste Lied THE END ist genau wie die anderen rockig , aber nicht der Knaller . Die anderen Lieder zum Beispiel ONE STEP CLOSER waren weit aus besser."
2,"Nach seinem Ausstieg bei Audioslave lässt Ex-Soundgarden Sänger Chris Cornell seinem Solodebut von 1999 jetzt mit dem programmatisch betitelten ""Carry On"" seinen zweiten Streich folgen, mit dem er mal wieder eine andere Richtung einschlägt. Auch wenn Cornell einer der wenigen Künstler aus der Grungezeit ist, dessen Erfolg die 90er überdauerte und der Herr zwischenzeitlich einige Titel einheimsen konnte kann ich jetzt keine weiteren Lobeshymnen singen. Auf dem neuen Soloalbum finden sich 14 (bzw. 15 mit Bonustrack) Titel, die ich nicht alle in den Alternativ-Rockbereich einordnen würde. Manchmal geht das ganze schon in Richung Blues und Soul. Die wenigen wirklich rockigeren Songs, wie ""Poison Eye"" oder ""Your Soul Today"", werden vielleicht noch ganz gut bei Soundgarden- bzw. Audioslave-Fans ankommen. Der Rest plätschert aber relativ belanglos und langweilig vor sich hin und manchmal klingt Chirs Cornell irgendwie schief. Hin- und wieder erinnert es ein wenig an lahme Nummern von Soundgarden, was sehr wahrscheinlich an der charakteristischen Stimme liegt. Die Mittelmäßigkeit des Albums wird dann aber auch nicht durch das merkwürdig schleppende Cover des Michael Jackson Hits ""Billy Jean"" herausgerissen. Nun und alle, die vom James-Bond-Titelsong ""You Know My Name"" angetan waren, sollten sich - sofern nicht schon geschehen - lieber mit dem Gedanken anfreunden nur die Single zu kaufen. Ob hier noch mal ein Hit drauf ist wage ich fast zu bezweifeln. ""Carry On"" kann man sich zwar anhören, aber irgendwie habe ich den Eindruck, dass Mr. Cornell damit besser in eine Landei-Bar irgendwo im Westen der USA gepasst hätte als in meinen CD-Player. Die Scheibe wird einfach nicht besser, egal wie oft ich sie höre. Ich empfehle lieber die Soundgarden- und Audioslave-Sammlung zu vervollständigen."
5,"Zu Albert Hammond gibt es viel zu sagen. Einer der erfolgreichsten Songwriter überhaupt (Für sich u.a.:""It Never Rains In Southern California"", für andere: ""One Moment In Time"", The Air That I Breathe"", ""I Don`t Wanna Loose You"") kehrt nach über 20 Jahren wieder solo zurück zum aktiven Musik machen. Mit seinen 60 Jahren spielte er mit Leo Sayer (den älteren noch bekannt) 14 neue Songs ein, die zeitlos sind. Ob folkiger Gitarrenpop (""This Side Of Midnight"", ""Sweetest Thing""), melancholische Balladen (""I'll Be Here For You"") oder Blues - bzw. Countryelemente: das alles klingt nach einer musikalischen Zeitreise zwischen 60er und 90er mit Anklängen an alte Heroen wie Dylan oder Lennon. Dafür aber erstaunlich erfrischend und in keiner Weise nostalgisch. Frische, jung gebliebene Musik, die damals einfach noch nicht komponiert wurde. Dafür glücklicherweise jetzt."
5,"Wie aus einem Mantra heraus erklingt die Reverie, als käme sie von ganz weit her. Es setzen Samples ein, der Klangteppich klingt unverbindlich, bis langsam die Gitarre verhalten die ersten Akkorde von sich gibt. Wie ein Pendel, der langsam durch eine unbekannte Kraft an Schwingungsenergie gewinnt. Der Bass und das Schlagzeug gesellen sich zu dem Saiteninstrument, sie harmonieren, hören sich zu, wie ein Wechselgesang rein instrumental. Aber auch bei der eher melancholischen Stimmung wippt der Kopf mit, der Rhythmus, auf dem sich langsam alles aufbaut, wird immer spürbarer, dominierender. Sich steigernde und wieder fallende Sequenzen sind ein Merkmal dieses Genres, und Daturah haben mit Reverie die gefährlichen Riffe gekonnt umschifft, die diese Musik langweilig machen können. Sie malen mit ihren Instrumenten bezaubernde Landschaften, bewegen sich in ihnen und machen deren Dimensionen auditiv erfahrbar . Mir gefällt besonders die unbändige Kraft, die hinter ihrer Musik steckt. Diese positive Kraft habe ich unlängst bei einem Konzert von Daturah erfahren dürfen. Die Musik birgt für mich trotz der Schwere ein Pool von Hoffnung. Und es hat den Anschein, als würden Daturah ganz leichtfüßig und freudig diesen eher melancholischen Pfad beschreiten."
5,"experimenteller rock von einer jungen schweizer band, wie man nur sehr, sehr selten findet. mit einflüssen von unzählbaren andersartigen elementen bzw. mischungen, die von punk bis elektronischem, von banjo bis triangel reichen und dem richtigen hauch von trash in der stimme. die band lebt die musik. beherrscht ihre instrumente in beeindruckenderweise. gibt tempo, zögert und macht spaß. unbedingt live empfehlenswert!"
1,"Regelmäßig gibt es ein neues Album von Leslie Mandoki. Und immer ist es das Gleiche! Man liest die Credits und denkt: ""Wow - was für ein erlesener Kreis von fabelhaften Musikern."" Und dann...hört man die CD und fragt sich nur: ""Was sind das nur wieder für langweilige, durchschnittliche Songs?"" Und viel schlimmer:""Was machen alle diese fabelhaften Musiker bei Herrn M. in Tutzing - kommen die nur wegen des Weißbiers?"" Das Ergebnis ist jedenfalls wie immer: Man kommt sich vor, als würde man Michael Schumacher beim Trabbifahren zusehen."
1,"Aua...das hier ist wieder einmal so eine CD die richtig weh tut ! Die Mädels auf dem Cover sehen genau so geklont aus, wie ihre Musik klingt. Nach einem Durchlauf des Albums befällt einen unweigerlich das beklemmende Gefühl die Ohren mit einer kalten antiseptischen Lösung gespült zu haben. Ich denke mal, dass wir hier eines der typischen Produkte vor uns haben, die uns in einem halben Jahr für 99 Cent am Wühltisch aufgedrängt werden."
4,"No Angels . Eine girlgroup. Ich bin kein fan von ihnen, manche  lieder sind ganz ok, andere eher nicht. Die Doppelplatte amaze me/Teardrops überzeugt nur zur hälfte. Amaze me ist eine ballade, wo ich den text (wie bei so vielen catsingband liedern ) nicht nso ganz verstehe (vom sinn her). eine eingängig Melodie, die aber nicht im Kopf hängen bleibt. Daher nur ein mittelmas von 3 sternen. Teardrops dagegen ist eine totale dancehymne. Der videoclip dazu wurde nur recht selten (oder gar nicht) im deutschen vernsehen ausgestrahlt. Die Produktion ist vielleicht nicht som aufwenig vom video wie für amaze me aber doch auch nicht schlecht. Teardrops ist allerdings auch die bisher stärlste singel von den No angels. Sie wagen etwas ganz neues. Der Club track mit Trance/Dance und Pop ist eingängig und läd gleich zum tanzen ein. Dieser Song verdient ganze 5 Sterne. Im allgemeinen ist die CD gut aufgemahct, viele remixe von treadrops und auch das dazugehörige video."
5,"Wow,Sarah!! Die Ballade ist einfach nur schön. Die dezenten Klänge a la ""From Sarah with love"" passen super zu Sarahs klangvoller, romantischer Stimme. Der Song hat was weinachtliches und zu den gefühlvollen Klängen kann man super träumen."
1,"und da ist sie wieder: die neue the dome. und was soll ich sagen? sie ist schlechter denn je. blödes und sinnloses chartsgedudel von track zu track. und das schlimmste an dem ganzen ist, dass es, ich möchte mal großzügig schätzen (ich betone großzügig, in wirklichkeit ist diese zahl viel zu hoch!), bestimmt 2,3 gute songs in den letzten wochen in die charts (auch in die höheren regionen) geschafft haben. doch, sie sind nicht auf einer dieser beiden cds zu finden. 40 tracks, und jeder einzelne ist ein musikalisches brechmittel. von sinnlos, über langweilig und erbärmlich bis hin zu abfall, der gleich alle schlechten und hier aufgeführten eigenschaften besitzt (in diesem fall spreche ich vorallem über tomekks gaxstaville part III, allein schon dieser name, argh!). ja, aber wer sich selber hasst, für den ist diese cd genau das richtige um sich mental fertig zu machen, es sei denn man gehört schon zu der sorte menschen, die wirklich hinter dieser 'musik' steht. wenn man dann noch die feste überzeugung hat, dass das alles hier gut ist, dann ist the dome vol.26 wirklich ideal. und wenn man schonmal dabei ist, dann kann man sich gleich noch alle 25 vorgänger bestellen, damit die produktion dieser compilations ja niemals endet."
5,"Da ich schon einige Alben von  Scooter besitze und mir auch diese gekauft habe, kann ich zum vergleich zu den anderen sagen, das dieses Album der beste Streich ist der Scooter gelungen ist. Es ""hämmert"" ohne Ende, ich kann ""The Satadium Techno Experience"" nur wärmstens weiter empfehlen."
5,"Ich habe das Lied bei den VMA 2001 im TV gesehen (als Premiere)abgesehen von ihrer Performances die auch wieder gut war,ist der Song "" I'm slave 4 U "" der absolute Hammer! Der Song ist sehr R'n'B lastig,ich finde den Song ein Highlight oder sogar der Highlight des Jahres 2001! Es ist ein neuer Stil bzw. ein weiter entwickelter Stil von Britney Spears! Bin auf das neue Album sehr gespannt nach dieser vorab Single,da kann man einiges erwarten und nicht nur das Duett mit ihrem Freund Justin Timberlake von NSync! Ich wuerde jeden raten diese Maxi zu kaufen,da kann ich mich nur wiederholen,weil der Song einfach nur richtig gut ist,und um die Zeit bis zum Album etwas zu versuessen und verkuerzen!"
5,Also ich hab mir die CD schon auf der Qlimax gekauft..und muss sagen für den preis lohtn es sich allemale....geile lieder..in nem fetten mix..KAUFEN KAUFEN KAUFEN!!!^^
5,"""Stomping Grounds"" ist meiner Meinung nach eines der besten Alben der kalifornischen Ska-Punk Band Goldfinger. Auf der CD befinden sich 13 wirklich hervorragende und sehr melodische Songs, die sich im Vergleich zu ihren älteren Alben ein wenig von dem klassischen Ska-Punk Stil entfernen und deutlich rockiger sind. Das Album ist sehr abwechslungsreich und es gibt kein Lied das mir nicht gut gefällt. Für Punk-Fans ist dieses Album ein absoluter Pflichtkauf!"
1,"..., ich weiß, das wird nur ""nicht hilfreiche"" Bewertungen geben: das Album ist wirklich Scheiße. Das klingt wie Die Ärzte! Texte auf Schlagerniveau."
2,"im ersten moment habe ich gar nicht so realisiert, dass auf dieser cd wirklich boysetsfire spielen.... gerade die ersten lieder hören sich im vergleich zu after the eulogy u.a. sehr anders an... wenn man sich ein bisschen auf die cd und vor allem auch auf die älteren lieder einlässt kann man sicherlich seine freude mit der cd haben, aber ich persönlich war ein wenig überrascht, denn einige lieder sind meiner meinung nach einfach schlecht...."
1,"nach dem ausstieg des früheren gitarristen und des schlagzeugers waren meine erwartungen an das neue opeth album nicht soooo hoch, da diese im Wesentlichen (bei lopez von den ersten zwei alben mal abgesehen) einen integralen bestandteil der band ausgemacht hatten. und genau diese erwartungen wurden auch erfüllt.leider.wer die opeth discographie bis zu ghost reveries im schrank hat, braucht hier nicht unbedingt zuzuschlagen. die smoothness und verspieltheit der älteren platten ist verlorengegangen, jetzt klingt es irgendwie nach marke ""fließbandmusik"". der neue drummer axenrot, der ja auch bei bloodbath trommelt, trommelt eben genau wie bei bloodbath, nur halt auf der neuen opeth platte. so gibts dann auch blastbeats zu hören, die so gar nicht zu opeth passen wollen.""toll"" werden einige sagen, ich finds total ausgelatscht.musste das sein?? aber abgesehen von dieser kleinen, nicht unbedingt positiven ""neuerungen"" ist die band auch in neuer besetzung eifrig dabei, sich selbst zu kopieren.  wer sich zu den diehard fans zählt, die gerne immer wieder gewohnte kost serviert bekommen wollen, wird hier trotzdem zuschlagen!neueinsteigern aber sind die wirklich endlos guten alben still life, blackwater park, deliverance und damnation zu empfehlen!und wer auf die große überraschung erwartet, sollte die finger hiervon lassen...und den stern gibts, weil ich als langjähriger opeth fan auch sehr gut ohne dieses album leben kann!"
5,"Das genau wieder eines der Alben bei denen man sich fragt, warum ein Mann wie Jackie Leven durch kleine Clubs tourt, während gleichzeitig musikalische Nullnummern wie Sarah Connor auf großen Bühnen ihre Belanglosigkeiten unters anspruchslose Volk bringen. ""Lovers at gunclub"" ist Qualitätsarbeit wie sie leider inzwischen nicht mehr selbstverständlich ist. Sowohl das Songwriting, als auch die Interpretation und die Aufnahmequalität heben sich angenehm vom Durchschnitt ab. Auch bringt es die warme Stimme Jackie Levens mit sich, dass man ihm jedes Wort das er singt auch glaubt. Für Puristen der Songwriterszene hat sich Jackie Leven inzwischen sicherlich schon sehr weit von seinen Wurzeln entfernt, aber Stagnation ist das Letzte was sich ein Künstler diesen Kalibers durchgehen lässt."
5,"Nicht nur dass auf diesem Meisterwerk der Musikgeschichte die großen Erfolge der Pretenders vertreten sind wie ""Precious"", ""Kid"", ""Brass in Pocket"" oder ""Stop your Sobbing"", hier spielen auch noch James Honeyman Scott, Peter Farndon und Martin Chambers die Instrunmente. Die Songs überzeugen: Rock der 60er Jahre wird grandios mit dem Punk der 70er Jahre vermischt und heraus kommen mitreißende und frisch klinge Pop Songs, die heute noch genau so begeistern wie vor fast 30 Jahren. Ein MUSS in jeder Plattensammlung"
1,"Tja...schlimm, schlimm was es heute alles gibt. Da meinen Leute dieser Bill könnte singen, aber über Geschmack lässt sich ja bekanntlich streiten. Aber ein tip an Tokio Hotel : Man sollte kein Album aufnehmen wenn der Sänger noch nich ma den Stimmbruch hinter sich hat!!! Hört auch Tobias Sammet von Edguy oder Joachim Cans von Hammerfall an!! Das sind Sänger..."
5,"Das nenn ich Soul mit viel Blues, abgeschmeckt mit einer ordentlichen Prise Folk und etwas Country! Herausgekommen ist dabei nicht ein Klangbrei, sondern glasklarer Soul der Oberklasse Jim Ford war mir zwar irgendwie immer ein Begriff, es sollte da auch eine LP ""Harlan County"" geben, und es schätzten ihn solche Größen wie Aretha Franklin, Bobby Womack oder Nick Lowe. ""The Sounds of Our Time"" enthält neben dem vollständigen Inventar von ""Harlan County"" (die ersten zehn Songs dieser CD) noch 15 teilweise seltene Single-Veröffentlichungen aus den frühen 70ern -- wow! Dieser bogenständige Soul geht einem ein wie Öl. Egal, ob etwa ""Dr Handy's Dandy Candy"" in rasendem Tempo rauhbeinigen Hillbilly-Sound mit viel Soul-Drive aufpoliert, einschließlich der ""Swing Low, Swing Chariot""-Einlage mittendrin, ob der einstmalige Titelsong ""Harlan County"" und ""Long Road Ahead"" Abräumer-Soul ohne Zuckerguss loslassen, ob ""To Make My Life Beautiful"" dem Soul viel Funk verpasst, ob ""To Make My Life Beautiful"" Folk und SOul kombiniert, oder ob Ford in ""Under Construction"" einen nach Country-Folk klingenden Melodie nach Art der Soul-Größen losbrettern lässt, einschließlich Edelpiano und Hintergrund-Sängerinnen ganz im Stil der 70er -- hier passt alles zusammen. Und sogar gelegentliche Streichergeschwader, z.B. in ""Love on My Brain"", passen hier haargenau, verbreiten genau diese Soul-Stimmung, die angeblich Weiße nicht zustandebringen können. Nicht nur die ersten 10 Songs (also das komplette ""Harlan County"") überzeugen restlos, auch wenn das schon diese CD zum Überflieger machen würde -- das unübertroffene Bear-Family-Label hat noch Alternativ-Versionen, Raritäten und ganz einfach Schönes obendrauf gepackt. Und ein dickes Booklet' ist auch dabei, das u.a. mitteilt, wer alles bei ""Harlan County"" mitgespielt hat: der Gitarrist war James Burton, dazu Jim Keltner, Mac Renneback (alias Dr John)... Das erklärt einiges. Was also die Zugaben angeht: Da kommt gleich als Höhepunkt das wunderbar ruhige, fast besinnliche ""Big Mouth USA"" mit dieser eindringlich-sanften, sparsamen Inszenierung -- und sowas verstaubte jahrzehntelang auf irgendwelchen Regalen! Eine der schönsten Soul-Interpretationen, die ich je gehört habe, die es mit dem Besten etwa von Solomon Burke aufnehmen kann. Überhaupt hat es dieser sanfte Soul der schier berstenden Zugabe in sich: Neben ""Big Mouth USA"" wären da noch ""36 Inches High"", ""Sounds Of Our Time"", ""Go Through Sunday"", ""Linda Comes Running"" -- bis ins Detail stimmt hier alles, und doch klingt das nie poliert, sogar wenn die Streicher in ""I Wonder What They'll do with Today"" etwas zu aufdringlich klingen. Richtig lebhaft wird's mit ""It Takes Two (To Make One)"", und die Uptempo-Version des ohnehin genialen ""Big Mouth USA"" legt noch ein Brikett drauf. Zum Reinhören für alle, die süchtig werden wollen, empfiehlt sich auch noch Fords Version des unverwüstlichen ""Chain Gang"" -- viel Seele packt Jim Ford da hinein, und bei ihm klingt das härter als z.B. bei Sam Cooke, weniger gefällig, und genauso schön, und bei aller Härte harmonisch, wie das bei guten Soul-Interpreten halt ist. Ähnlich stark: ""She Turns My Radio On"" -- das ist Soul, der alles wegfegt, was sich ihm in den Weg stellt. ""Rising Sign"" wiederum erklärt ohne viel Aufhebens, warum die Temptations so viel von Jim Ford hielten, und ""Ramona"" fegt energisch alle Genre-Definitionen hinweg, die nicht schnell genug wegrennen. Dass sich Soul am Ende auch noch mit Country kombinieren lässt, und dass diese Kombination hinreißend ist, das wiederum beweist ""Happy Songs Sell Records, Sad Songs Sell Beer"". Welcher Artikel sich zum ganzen Album besser verkauft, mag ich allerdings nicht entscheiden. Am besten schnappt man sich erst einmal die CD ""The Sounds of Our Time"", und dann sehmer weiter... wenn wir's den ganzen Mittag angehört haben, und den Abend lang bis in die Nacht hinein... wenn wir am nächsten Morgen nur aufstehen, weil da noch diese CD anzuhören wäre..."
4,"Und wieder eine traumhafte Platte aus dem Norden. Da lacht einem doch die liebe Sonne ins Herz. Wieder haben die 4 schwedischen Musiker ein Album abgeliefert. Und wieder kann ich sagen, besser denn je.  Diese Band ist eine der wenigen, die es wirklich jedes mal schafft, besser zu werden - ähnlich macht es In Flames. Wieder gibt es wuchtige Songs mit noch wuchtigeren Riffs. Genug der Worte - kaufen und genießen. Warum nur 4 Sterne - ganz einfach, 10 Lieder von dieser Band sind zu schnell durchgehört."
5,"""A fine day to exit"" war ein gutes Album. Doch richtig konsequent konnten und wollten Anathema ihren Hang zu Radiohead damals noch nicht ausleben. Dies machte ""AFDTE"" zu einem Monument des kreativen Schwebezustandes. Nicht mehr und nicht weniger.  ""A natural disaster"" ist da ein ganz anderes Kaliber. Schon die schwebenden Eingangstöne des Openers ""Harmonium"" machen klar, dass dies kein Album der halben Sachen ist. Bestechend gut komponiert schlängeln sich Anathema eine knappe Stunde lang durch die Musikgeschichte - ohne Durchhänger. Pink Floyd, die göttlichen Porcupine Tree, besagte Radiohead und (man höre ""Closer"") auch Air mögen hier als vage Referenzen dienen.  Melancholische Soundlandschaften umschweben das Ohr des geneigten Hörers, Stille wird zum Strukturprinzip. Das alles ist wunderbar in Szene gesetzt und geschmackvoll montiert.  Mit diesem Album könnten Anathema ganz groß werden - oder weiter ein sehr feiner Geheimtipp bleiben."
2,"Die ersten drei CD's sind wirklich recht gelungen, aber die Bonus-CD mit den interessanten raren Tracks läuft weder auf meinem PC noch auf meinem DVD-Player oder im Auto. Da ich neueste Geräte im Einsatz habe, bin ich schon sehr enttäuscht, da gerade diese vierte CD Lieder beinhaltet, die man nicht auf jeder ""Best of""-Sammlung findet."
5,"POST ist die beste platte von björk. tolle melodien, raffinierte arrangements und witzige performances. was will man mehr?"
5,"Ich bin nun wirklich kein Popmusik-Fan. Ganz im Gegenteil. Ich liebe klassische Filmmusik, Metal in all seinen Formen, Jazz und Ragtime.  Und dann sehe ich die geniale Isländerin einfach so des nächtens im Fernsehen. Und es war ausgerechnet auch noch ""Venus as a boy"" was mich da hypnotisiert und neugierig gemacht hatte.  Zugegeben, ich stoppte zunächst nur wegen der wunderschönen Sängerin für einen kurzen Moment. Doch der reichte aus um mich zum Fan zu machen.  Wenig später hatte ich die CD, und war begeistert! Was hatte ich da nur bisher verpasst?!  Die Musik strotzt nur so vor genialen Einfällen, schöner Musik und Texten! Ein Meisterwerk! Ich kann diese CD (und Björk im allgemeinen) nur jedem weiter empfehlen.  Manche hassen sie, manche lieben sie! Ich tue devinitiv letzteres!"
1,"ist schon, dass Rhianna auch noch letzte Woche bei den Awards ausgezeichnet wurde. Fakt ist, dass man wirklich auf keinerlei Verleihungen mehr hören sollte, und diese ja nicht als Qualitätsmaßstabe ansetzen darf. Heutzutage wird auch der totale Mist ausgezeichnet. Naja, also genau so wie der Kack Song und Nervtöter Umbrella ist das ganze Album. Für Janet Jackson Fans unerträglich!"
1,"Leider vertane Verbesserung der Optik, das Lied ist echt unterirdisch, eher was für die Unifete, aber da auch nicht wirklich, ein Sommersong mit unglaublich schlechtem Text, wenig Melodie und für mich einfach unsinnig. Schade, das wird nix werden. Mir und vielen anderen, die ich kenne, gefällt es gar nicht."
2,"Diese CD ist wirklich langweilig. Zwar sind gute Musiker vertreten, beherrschen alle ihre Instrumente, aber es fehlt die ganze CD über das Besondere, das Außergewöhnliche. Die Stücke sind langweilig und vorhersehbar. Nein, diese Platte ist keine Weltklasse. Zwar groovt es irgendwie, aber eben sehr gerade, nichts spannendes. Solche CDs gibt es zu dutzende. Im Vergleich zur Weltklasse, sei es Herbie Hancock, Stanley Clarke, Brecker Brother usw. zeigt sich, was fehlt: Esprit und Funk. Diese CD klingt ein wenig nach eine Jazzrock-Musikschul-Ensemble."
5,"Es gibt Alben, die legt man ein und schon die ersten Töne hauen einen dermaßen um, dass man denkt, man stünde im Windkanal (jetzt bitte einen arg verbogenen Rezensenten mit wehenden Haaren in arger Rücklage vorstellen). Bei ""Boys And Girls In America"" heißt dieser Windkanal ""Stuck between stations"". Besser hat schon lange kein Album mehr angefangen. Das ist Heartland-Rock, wie ihn Bruce Springsteen 1975 gemacht hat. Und an allen Ecken und Enden spürt man auf ""Boys And Girls In America"" den gleichen Spirit, den auch der Boss vor dreißig Jahren rüberbringen wollte, nur transportiert in das Jahr 2006. Dabei zeigen Craig Finn und seine Mannen im Grunde genommen nur die Oberflächlichkeit der amerikanischen Jugendlichen auf. Drogen, Alkohol, Sex. Das Leben ist eine einzige Party, nichts anderes. Und The Hold Steady liefern auch noch den Soundtrack dazu. Auch das erinnert an den Boss, dessen größter Hit, ""Born in the U.S.A."", 1984 komplett falsch verstanden worden war. Nach dem famosen Opener geht es mit dem nicht minder genialen ""Chips ahoy!"" weiter. Auch hier wieder die geniale Mischung aus Gitarre, Orgel, Bass, Schlagzeug - die typische Heartland-Rock-Besetzung eben, die gerne von einem Klavier vervollständigt wird. Dem furiosen Auftakt folgen zunächst mal zwei eher konventionelle Rocker, die nicht mehr ganz mit den vorangegangen Meisterwerken mithalten können, aber immer noch besser sind, als vieles, was 2006 erschienen ist. Erst mit der tollen Ballade ""First night"" gibt es endlich eine Atempause. Auch ""Party Pit"" eignet sich zum Verschnaufen, zieht aber die Zügel wieder ein wenig an und erinnert am meisten an Springsteen. Finn wiederholt hier unbeirrt das Mantra der amerikanischen Jugend: ""Gonna walk around and drink some more."" ""You can make him like you"" zeigt die Macht der holden Weiblichkeit, die jeden Jungen um den Finger wickeln kann (""There's always other boys, there's always other boyfriends""). Der textlich skurrilste Text ist aber definitiv ""Chillout tent"", wo sich ein Mädchen, das zuviele ""Magic Mushrooms"" zu sich genommen hat und ein Junge, der anstatt einer gleich vier Pillen eingeworfen hat, im Medizinzelt eines Musikfestivals im abgewrackten Zustand treffen, kennenlernen zwischen all den komatösen Patienten wild rummachen. Das seltsame Pärchen wird übrigens von Soul-Asylum-Sänger Dave Pirner und Reputation-Sängerin Elizabeth Elmore gesungen. Nach elf Songs in 40 Minuten endet ""Boys And Girls In America"". Und das beste ist, wenn man die Platte einfach wieder einlegt. Und wieder. Und wieder. Das beste Album 2006. Ein Meisterwerk."
5,"Diese Einspielung entstand zu einer Zeit, da viele - damals wie heute - den Stern von Maria Callas erlöschen sahen. Doch diese Aufnahme lässt eine Maria Callas vor dem geistigen Auge erscheinen, die nichts von ihrer Faszination und Interpretationskunst eingebüßt hat! Diese Carmen ist wunderbar mitreißend, schwungvoll gesungen und von einer wunderbar klaren Diktion. Ihre Stimme hat sie dabei sehr gut unter Kontrolle. Mit Nicolai Gedda steht ihr ein Don José mit einem wunderbaren, strahlenden Tenor zur Seite. Wer Carmen liebt muss! diese Aufnahme haben."
1,"Ich schließe mich voll der Wertung der bereits veröffentlichten Rezension an. Auch ich bedaure es sehr, daß zahlreiche Hits von Frank Schöbel wie z.B. ""Alt wie die Welt"", ""Bis ich dich wiederseh'"", ""Bitte komm wieder"", ""Bring dein Korn unter's Dach"" ""Dich zu lieben ist nicht immer leicht"", ""Dein letzter Brief"", ""Die wunderschöne Zeit mit dir"", ""Du, wer lacht so wie du"", ""Hier hab' ich mit dir gelebt"" ""Laß doch die grauen Wolken"", ""Noch ist nicht's gescheh'n"", ""Mit dir verlier' ich alles"", ""Schreibst du mir, schreib ich dir"", ""Und so trink' ich mienen Wein allein"" etc. nach wie vor fehlen."
4,"Canora zeigt auch mit ihrer zweiten Serie, dass mit Ihnen zu rechnen sein wird. Der große Wurf ist es noch nicht, was vielleicht an der Groschenromanvorlage liegt. Manche Dialoge sind doch sehr plump und hölzern. Aber die Umsetzung ist technisch deutlich besser als die vieler anderen kleinen Labels und zeigt, dass das Label generell auf dem richtigen Weg ist. Was fehlt ist ein innovativer Stoff, eine Serie, die etwas bewegt. Da war Der Orden näher dran. Ich hoffe, da geht es bald weiter. Denn im Moment wird man mit Hörspielreihen nach Groschenromanhelden des Gruselgenres geradewegs zugeschmissen (Tony Ballard, Dorian Hunter, Macabros, Gespensterkrimi). Irgendwann ist der Markt gesättigt."
2,"Während ich die alten Sleep-Platten liebe, und auch die neue Band des Sleep-Gitarristen, Higher on Fire sehr schätze, kann ich zumindest mit diesem Album gar nichts anfangen. &lt;&gt; ist ein vier Songs starkes Werk, das sowohl vom Gesang als auch vom instrumentalen her vor allem eins tut: Langweilen. Um so zu hypnotisieren, wie zum Beispiel bei &lt;&lt;Dopesmoker&gt;&gt; fehlt den Songstrukturen einfach die Kraft, dem Gesang einfach das Durchdringende. Abgesehen davon ist einer der Riffs ganz offensichtlich von Pink Floyds &lt;&lt;Set The Controls for the Hearts of the Sun&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;geliehen.&gt;&gt; Sorry, ich stehe wirklich auf langsame und eindringliche Sounds, aber diese Scheibe ist einfach nur einschläfernd."
2,"Ich hab das Album jetzt schon, seit 1,5 Jahren. Und was ist mir in Erinnerung geblieben. Eigentlich nichts. Schön und gut sich weiter zu entwickeln. Aber wenn dann richtig. Die Musik ist meistens langweilig. Tocotronic haben sich mit ihrer harten, direkten Musik eine Fangemeinde aufgebaut und kaum waren sie so richtig bekannt, machen sie genau das Gegenteil zu dem. Kann ja auch cool sein unberechenbar zu sein. Aber die Songs sind einfach nur Mittelmaß.  Unter anderem die Wichtigtuerei, nichts mehr auf einfache Art und Weise auszudrücken, sondern krampfhaft nach komplizierter Ausdrucksweise zu suchen geht einen tierisch auf den Sack.  Zwar hätten sich Tocotronic nach den ersten vier Alben nicht mehr übertreffen können, warum auch irgendeine Veränderung nötig war, aber doch nicht so eine. Schade, werdet einfach wieder einer von uns und dann wirds auch wieder."
5,"Ignite  - Our Darkest days - CD-Review 1.Intro (Our Darkest Days) Das ist kein Intro.Das ist eine Hymne.Mit einer länger von knapp einer Minute schafft es dieser Song mir immer wieder gansehaut zu verschaffen. Der mehrstimmige Gesang im Sing-Sang mit Zoli passt einfach.Dazu das Drum-Gewitter und der ""Song"" ist fast perfekt, da er zu kurz ist ;-) 4,5/5 2.Bleeding Man kannte den Song ja schon von der mai spaisch Seite von Ignite. Die Hip Hop ähnliche Strophe trifft zwar nicht ganz meinen Geschmack, allerdings lässt  der Refrain und die Bridge das Herz eines jeden melodic-Hardcore Fans höher schlagen.Spitzen Song. 4/5 3.Fear Is Our Tradition Hammer Gitarren-Intro,der Song ist vielleicht ein bischen Punkig.Aber das stört nicht wenn 500 Menschen auf einem Konzert zusammen ""Fear Is Our Tradition"", brüllen, als würden sie nie einen anderen Song gehört haben. 4,5/5 4.Let It Burn Nanu? Ignite=Emo "" I Thinking of you""? was soll das denn ? Naja wenn man sich ein bisschen die Lyrics anschaut merkt man schnell, das dieses Song für eine Verstorbenen Freundin ist? Bei so Situationen darf Ignite auch einen ""Emo"" Song schreiben. 3,5/5 5.Poverty For All Mit Abstand der beste Song der Platte. Schneller Hardcore ohne Schnick-Schnack PUNKT. Die Sozialkritischen Texte dürfen auch nicht fehlen, doch sie sind nicht gegen den Sündenbock der Amerekanischen HardcorePunk Szene , Georg W. Bush.Nein, der Song geht straight an die vergangenheit von Zoli und seiner Familie, die in einem kommunistischen Regime lebten.  7/5&lt;-- weil der song einfach nur Hammer ist. 6.My Judgement Day Für meinen geschmack etwas zu Poppig, ich könnte mir den Song bei MTV vorstellen aber dadurch würde das Niveau zu sehr in die höhe gepushed, und das kann sich MTV nunmal nicht leisten. 3/5 7.Slowdown Solider Song.Und schon wieder eine Persönliche Abrechnung mit Zoli Teglas leben. Der Song hat einen Hammer zwischen Part 4/5 8.Save Yourself Schon wieder Emo? Diesmal aber richtig, diese Lyrics könnten höchst Persönlich von Chris Carrabba stammen. Trotzdem regt das Lied nicht zum Weinen an , sondern zum Moshen bis der Arzt kommt. 4/5 9.Are You Listening Oldschool Hardcore In Ya Face.Dieser Song braucht nicht mehr als 1:22 Minuten.Er bringt alles auf den Punkt. 5/5 10.Three Years LoveSong müssen auch mal bei Ignite sein, ich weiß zwar nicht warum aber sie müssen nun mal auch sein. Immerhin versteckt sich gegen Song Mitte ein schönes Solo. 3,5/5 11.Know Your History Dieses Lied würde ich gern mal den meisten Schülern Weltweit zum auswendig lernen geben, um einen Beitrag gegen die Globale verdummung beizusteuern. Hammer HardcoreSong mit kurzem aber brachialen Solo. 5/5 12.Strength Sing-A-Song Alarm, denn immer wenn ich dieses Song höre, möcht ich einflach lautlos "" Strenghts"" schreien.Meiner Meinung könnte dieser Song auch gut aus den Anfängen von Ignite stammen. 5/5 13.Sunday Bloody Sunday Was soll man zu diesem Lied noch viel sagen? Eins der besten Cover aller Zeiten. Nun auch Weltweit auf Vinyl und CD zu hören und nicht nur noch auf dem Europa-Release von "" A Place Called Home"" 5/5 14.Live For Better Days Auch Acoustic können Ignite überzeugen.Achtung Gänsehaut Alarm. Und ein ungarischer Secret-Track im Anschluss. 5/5 Gesamt 63 von 70 möglichen Punkten Fazit: Ignite haben es geschaft und ""A Place Called Home""  mit ""Our Darkest Days"" einen würdigen Nachfolger zu schaffen. Unbedingt Kaufen , auch für nicht Hardcore Fans."
2,"Ruhiger und verhaltener als die mit beinahe unveränderter Besetzung eingespielte CD ""Überjam"". Leider kommt schon beim dritten Stück Langeweile auf, die sattsam bekannte Paarung IBANEZ JSM 100 und Chorus-Pedal ist schon auf zu vielen Scheiben zu hören; die instrumentalen Solobeiträge von John Scofield sind gering und schlaff, da schafft jeder DJ mehr Spannung. Die CD hält auch keinem Vergleich mit ""Überjam"" stand. Kommt davon, wenn man die ganze Nacht aufbleibt."
2,"Also, heute war es soweit, das neue Album landete in meinen cd player. Zuerst sollte ich noch erwähnen das ich auf jeden fall ein großer fan von offspring bin, obwohl CoO nicht der hammer war, aber trotzdem nicht schlecht. Aber was ich gerade eben hören musste überraschte mich leider äußerst negativ. Dexters stimme hat ganz klar an qualität verloren. Die schnelleren songs wirken wie einheitsbrei. Da klingt aber auch wirklich alles gleich, allerdings gleich schlecht und langweilig. Melodik ist leider auch nicht wirklich vorhanden die songs sind eben einfach nur schnell. Das geht ja alles gerade noch, wenn da nicht diese ""experimente"" wären. When your in prison ist ja nun wirklich das allerletzte, das hätte sich selbst in den 20er jahren keiner anhören wollen und jetzt wird das den fans einer punk rock band angetan, was soll das bitte ??? Und dann wäre da noch dieser ""a tribute to bob marley"" song. Was will ich auf einer von schlechten punk dominierten cd mit so einem zeug. das passt ja wohl überhaupt nicht und klingt zudem noch ober peinlich! Ach ja, Hit That, die single dürfte ja manchem bekannt sein. Und ich frage mich : Sind wir hier bei Ententanz oder was ??? Der song ansich wäre ja vielleicht wirklich gut aber die elektonischen elemente machen den song zum Kinderlied, und die enttäuschend schwache stimme von dexter tut ihr übriges. also lieber finger weg und von alten zeiten träumen, denn ich befürchte von offspring werden wir wohl nichts ordentliches mehr zu hören bekommen ..."
4,"Sehr schöne Zusammenstellung aus verschiedenen Programmen. Leider gehen ein paar Scherze verloren, da sie auf visuellem Humor beruhen. Wenn man das zugehörige Programm gesehen hat, ist es trotzdem lustig."
2,"Manuel Rosenthal - dieser Name sollte jeden Offenbach-Kenner auch in diesem Falle aufhorchen lassen. Unabhängig davon, was man von seinen Offenbach-Bearbeitungen Gaîté Parisienne"" und Offenbachiana"" denkt: Von einem Dirigenten, der sich derart intensiv mit dem offenbachschen Gesamtwerk beschäftigt hat, sollte man eigentlich mehr erwarten können: Schon in Pomme d'Api"", einem eher lyrischen, ruhigen Einakter, der meiner Meinung nach nicht gerade zu den Höhepunkten des Schaffens Offenbachs zählt, treten Rosenthals eigentümliche Vorstellungen einer gelungenen Interpretation recht deutlich zu Tage: Statt sich auf die eher lyrische Atmosphäre einzulassen, versucht er dem Werk einen buffonesken Ton aufzuzwingen und scheitert damit zwar nicht völlig, erreicht aber auch nicht sein Ziel. Daran ändert auch eine weitere Vorliebe Rosenthals, die deutlich hörbare - und auf Dauer ziemlich nervige! - Dominanz sämtlicher Schlaginstrumente, nichts.  Charles Burles und Jean-Philippe Lafont können angesichts der schon genannten Fehler im Konzept zwar nicht brillieren, liefern dennoch aber eine gute Leistung ab. Der recht positive Eindruck des Gesangsensembles wird leider durch Mady Mesplé getrübt, deren wenig voluminöse und meist schrille Stimme grundsätzlich schon wenig angenehm ist, in einem Werk wie Pomme d'Api aber völlig fehl am Platz ist.  Während die obige Einspielung von Pomme d'Api"" insgesamt noch durchaus akzeptabel ausfällt, wird Monsieur Choufleuri restera chez lui"" geradezu zur Geduldsprobe.  Dies beginnt schon damit, dass die wundervolle Ouvertüre, einer der besten Ouvertüren Offenbachs überhaupt, durch eine Amputation von mehr als Hälfte des Stückes grässlich verstümmelt wurde. Dieser nicht gerade positive erste Eindruck wird durch die schon in Pomme d'Api"" deutlich gewordene, unheilvolle Vorliebe Rosenthals für Schlaginstrumente noch weiter in den Keller gezogen. Dies geht soweit, dass die Aufnahme eine völlig unpassende, geradezu militärische Grundstimmung erhält. Rosenthals überaus schleppendes, an manchen Stellen geradezu langweiliges, Dirigat gibt dem Stück endgültig den Rest.  Die absolute Krönung des Übels erwartet den Hörer jedoch im vorletzten Stück des Einakters - dem Trio italien, das eigentlich eine erstklassige Parodie auf die italienische Oper darstellen sollte. Wie gesagt: sollte. Dazu kommt es nämlich aufgrund einer Neuorchestrierung der Nummer durch den Dirigenten nicht. Denn das, was nach dieser Bearbeitung übrig blieb, klingt, wenn es überhaupt noch nach etwas klingt, höchstens nach einer Parodie auf das offenbachsche Ausgangsstück und nicht nach einer Satire auf die Bellcantoära.  Das Gesangsensemble schlägt sich diesen eher unglücklichen Umständen entsprechend wacker, dennoch hätte man von Sängern wie Michel Hamel, Jean-Philippe Lafont und Charles Burles eigentlich mehr erwartet. Mady Mesplés schrille Stimme fällt in diesem Ensemble erneut negativ auf, bleibt aber im immer noch annehmbaren Bereich.  Insgesamt verpasst diese Einspielung jedoch bei Weitem ein annehmbares Gesamtergebnis: Charakter und Stimmung des Werkes geht aufgrund grober Fehler und Unachtsamkeiten schlichtweg verloren. Somit kann ich sowohl dem Offenbach-Kenner als auch dem Offenbach-Interessierten eigentlich nur raten, sich nach einer anderen Aufnahme des Werkes umzusehen. Wie mir die wundervolle, quellenkritische und insbesondere espritvolle Einspielung von 2005 aus Lyon (Dirigent: Benjamin Lévy) deutlich gezeigt hat, lohnt es sich!  Mit Mesdames de la Halle"" erwartet den von den beiden vorhergehenden Offenbach-Verunstaltungen strapazierten Zuhörer eine wahre Wohltat - die am besten gelungene der drei vorliegenden Aufnahmen.  Manuel Rosenthal lässt seiner Vorliebe für Schlaginstrumente trotz hörbarer Dominanz derselben keinen derart freien Lauf mehr wie in den vorigen Aufnahmen. Auch mit der Wahl der Tempi und Stimmungen liegt er weitaus richtiger als in Pomme d'Api"" oder Monsieur Choufleuri"". Sogar das ursprüngliche Konzept, sämtliche Markfrauen von männlichen Sängern verkörpern zu lassen, wurde (im Gegensatz zur Aufnahme des französischen Rundfunks) übernommen.   Somit kommt das Ensemble von Sängerinnen und Sängern, die sich durchaus sehen lassen können, endlich zu angemessener Geltung. Lediglich Mady Mesplé fällt aufgrund ihres schrillen Timbres erneut ein wenig unangenehm auf, was den insgesamt positiven Eindruck jedoch nicht trübt.  Die abschließende Frage, ob die vorliegende 3-CD-Box nun zu empfehlen oder nicht zu empfehlen ist, ist schwer zu beantworten. Um den Einakter Pomme d'Api"" kennen zu lernen, dürfte dies wohl aktuell die einzige Möglichkeit sein, denn die alternative Aufnahme unter Emmanuel Koch (erschienen beim Label Bourg) ist schon lange vergriffen. Wer jedoch Monsieur Choufleuri"", meiner Meinung nach einer der besten Einakter Offenbachs, genießen möchte, dem kann ich nur die schon genannte Alternative empfehlen. Lediglich in Sachen Mesdames de la Halle"" ist diese CD durchaus zu empfehlen."
1,"Nein! Bei dieser Gruppe fällt überhaupt nicht auf, dass geldgeile Produzenten das Land kreuz und quer durchsucht haben, um einen Nachfolger Von Tokio Hotel zu finden ( als ob das nicht schlimm genung wäre)!!! Die sind so richtig scheiße, leider aber nicht auf ne schöne Art und Weise. Die Texte sind meist völlig sinnfrei und die Melodie hat keinerlei Wiedererkennnungswert Ich habe fertig!"
4,"Kein Klassiker, aber auf jeden Fall das Geld wert. Die Handlung macht Sinn und wird intelligent aufgebaut. Die Sprecher agieren auf gewohntem Niveau. Gut!"
2,"vor allem die nervige Omi Amy, die beim tanzen umkippt und angeblich tot ist... Die ganze Folge ist eine Qual und lohnt ein zweites hören nicht.  Trotzdem 2 Sterne, weil ich unsere Drei so gerne höre und sie wirklich klasse sind."
5,"dieser hit macht süchtig.die lieder sind super .find you here ,ist das genialste was wolfsheim je geliefert hat.leider kam dieser hit in deutschland nie groß raus.weil es kaum einer kannte.spielt man es den leuten vor will es jeder haben....einfach toll"
1,"Dies ist meines Erachtens die mit Abstand schlechteste CD von Elton John. Die ganzen Titel klingen grauenvoll nach Bontempiorgel der 70er Jahre. Absoluter Tiefpunkt ist dann der letzte Titel ""Gulliver/Hay chewed/Reprise"", eine seltsame Aneinanderreihung verschiedener Einzeltitel, die schlicht und ergreifend nervt. Aber auch die anderen Stücke wie beispielsweise ""Val-hala"" oder vor allem auch ""Skyline pigeon"" zeigen nur billiges Orgelgedudel im Hintergrund und erinnern eher an Mambo Kurt, als an einen ernstzunehmenden Elton John. Zum Glück hat Elton John noch reihenweise andere LPs, die um ein Vielfaches besser sind."
1,"Was PUR diesmal zu bieten hat ist wirklich enttäuschend. Nachdem eher schwachen letzten Album, legt die Truppe um Hartmut Engler noch einen drauf: leider im negativen Sinne. Die Songs sind alle klischeehaft und ohne Witz. Es gibt keine originellen  Strukturen oder innovative Neuheiten. Alles ist irgendwie schon mal dagewesen und nun in schlechterer Form nochmal dageboten. *Gähn* Finger weg!"
2,"Hier ist er, der Anfang vom Ende! Partiell ein gutes Album, aber kein Vergleich mehr mit älteren Werken. Hat man damals live noch zu ""Superjeilezick"" gefeiert und nur von ""der Polka"" gesprochen, mutiert der Song heute zur Nervensäge! Schade eigentlich! Positiv bleiben Songs wie ""Dä Spanier"" und ""Ohne Dich"" zu erwähnen! Auch textliche Höhepunkte wie bei ""Einen Schritt Voraus"" kann man finden, leider driften diese etwas ab, durch eine mehr als seichte musikalische Untermalung! Es war - und die neueren Alben geben uns recht - der Anfang vom Ende!"
1,"Eigentlich finde ich Nico Gemba ja sehr gut, aber was uns da als Album verkauft wird ist der Witz. Gut, der Megamix ist sehr lang geworden, aber ansonsten - sehr magere Ausbeute. Da muss sogar ein paar Sekunden dauerndes Intro aufgelistet werden, damit es ""nach mehr"" aussieht. Warum man da nicht zumindest noch die letzte Single ""Lieb mich ein letztes Mal"" (die ja auf dem letzten Album nicht enthalten war) mit drauf nimmt, verstehe ich nicht so ganz. Und das Cover - grausam. Die letzten beiden Alben von Nico Gemba verdienen 5 Sterne - für dieses kann man allerdings nur 1 Stern geben. Leider ein Schritt zurück und nicht nach vorn - schade."
1,"Tja tja tja...wie war das noch mit Shockmuzik? Ja richtig! So mancher erinnert sich noch sehr, sehr dunkel an die letzten, die versucht haben sich im Schatten und mit dem Ruhm und Hype um AGGRO Berlin hochzuziehen...ja und wo sind die Mannen um Irie-D jetzt?? Hmm...ich weiß auch nicht! Ich habe die News schon vernommen, dass Selfmade auf dem neuen Sampler jetzt natürlich gegen Fler und Aggro schießt...naja wenn man so mehr CDs an den Mann bringen kann! Ein kleiner Diss hier, ein großer Diss da und fertig ist die Platte für den geneigten Hater!! Wer es nicht selber kann...der muss eben zu sehen wie er es macht!! Jungs, versucht doch mal mit Talent und vernünftigen Storys zu glänzen?!"
5,"diese cd rockt. cky zeigt wiedermal was sie drauf haben. mit ihrer zweiten cd (es gab soweit ich weiß noch n soundtrack zu den 3 cky-filmen, der unter cky vol.2 erschienen is, auf dem sind aber net nur cky zu hörn) ist den jungs wiedermal ein meisterstück gelungen, auch wenns meiner meinung nach net ganz an vol.1 rankommt, ist sie auf jeden fall den kauf wert. das album ist wiedermal sehr abwechslungsreich und hat nicht nur doch recht harten rock, sondern auch sehr schöne melodien zu bieten, und das alles im guten und unverkennbaren cky-stil. wer also ne abwechslung von dem ganzen mist haben will, der uns aufgetischt wird sollte sich dieses album auf jedenfall besorgen, und natürlich auch alle, die schon von vol.1 begeistert waren."
4,"Schon wer den Film sieht, wird merken wie gekonnt die Musik wieder einmal dazu passt. Der Charakter des Filmes wird musikalisch perfekt getroffen und dabei sind die Lieder doch so unterschiedlich, dass sie jeden Geschmack ansprechen sollten und den Soundtrack auch nicht langweilig werden lassen. Vielleicht nicht unbedingt eine CD, die man sich mehrmals täglich anhören kann, aber als Hintergrundmusik für eine Party ist sie wirklich perfekt geeignet und auch sonst zum Anhören und einfach mal die Gedanken kreisen lassen. Mein persönliches Lieblingsstück auf dieser CD ist ""69 Police"", welches meiner Meinung nach eines der besten Filmkompositionen überhaupt ist. Ich spiele es wirklich rauf und runter und kann gar nicht genug davon bekommen. Auch ist es bei diesem Soundtrack das ziemlich gut gelungen, was bei den meisten anderen doch eher störend ist: Textstellen aus dem Film wurden nicht geschnitten, sondern so beibehalten und nur an einigen Stellen konnte ich feststellen, dass der Cut zum nächsten Lied aufgrund gesprochener Texte nicht ganz reibungslos verlief. Einige der coolen Sprüche aus dem Film hat man so auch auf CD verewigt und von der filmtypisch coolen Art zu sprechen von George Clooney kann man sowieso nicht genug bekommen, vor allem bei ""69 Police"" nicht. Zusammenfassend wäre zu sagen, dass diese CD eine gekonnte Mischung aus den eigens für den Film komponierten Stücken und alteingessesenen Ohrwürmern Marke Elvis &amp; Co. ist, gekrönt mit einigen der besten Zitaten aus dem Film. Vor dem Kauf der CD würde ich aber dennoch empfehlen, den Film noch einmal anzuschauen und dabei genau auf die Musik zu achten, sie mag nicht jedermanns Geschmack treffen."
4,"Der Soundtrack hat mega groove, David holmes, der die meisten Songs geschrieben hat es geschafft dem Film ein irres tempo zu verleihen. Die songs sind überwiegend durch einen super-funkigen bass geprägt, der sehr gut zu samplen ist. Bei diesen Nummern möchte man am liebsten gleich ein Casino ausrauben, weil man einfach nicht still sitzen bleiben kann."
5,"zugegeben, die CD schmeckt erst nach wiederholtem Anhören, aber ist das nicht wieder genial von Mylene? Sie hat sich Zeit gelassen, viel Zeit. Viel Zeit für Gerüchte im Web und für zu hoch gesteckte Erwartungen. Da ich Mylenes Schaffen schon sehr lange schätze, weiß ich, dass sie sich bei allem etwas denkt. Das Album läutet die lang erwartete Tour ein. Was uns da geboten wird, kann noch keiner wissen und damit bleibt wieder Platz für die Spekulationen. Ich bin froh, dass ich Tickets habe und fahre sehr gerne nach Bercy. Gerne lasse ich mich überraschen, verzaubern und elektrisieren von Mylene und ihrer Welt. Nicht jedem erschließt sich die Musik sofort. Außerdem hatte sie mit den letzten beiden Studioalben enorm vorgelegt. Wer die fetzigen Stücke mag, dem sei auch die Anamorphose nahe gelegt. Auch von diesem Album wird es live was zu hören geben. Ganz sicher."
5,"- er feiert sein 30. buehnenjubilaeum im jahr 1993 (damit begeht er dieses jahr also sein 40. !!!) + laesst den grossteil der zwei stunden musik auf dieser doppel cd von anderen bestreiten. bzw. er stellt """"nur"""" seine songs zur verfuegung + davon hat er ja wahrlich eine menge. da er eigentlich eh nicht richtig singen kann, vom gitarre spielen mal gar nicht zu reden..., ist das hier eine sehr abwexlungsreiche und feine sache."
2,"Diese im Jahr 1999 veröffentlichte Aufnahme ist sehr verschieden von der im Jahre 1997 von Polydor veröffentlichten: - nur ein kleines Orchester - einige der besonders eingängigen Melodien fehlen (dafür sind - das muss man  hinzufügen - andere, aber wie ich meine nicht so eingängige -  hinzugekommen)."
5,"WOW, echt geiles Album, das warten hat sich wirklich gelohnt. Frau Setlur hat mal wieder gezeigt was für einen excellenten Musik Geschmack sie hat. Sie ist erwachsener und reifer, und dieses hört man deutlich. Sabrina hat es einfach drauf, das hat sie uns mit ROT mal richtig bewiesen. Die Songs sind teilweise schnell, und zum abtanzen,haben einen echt coolen groove. Dann gibt es auch ein paar langsamere Songs auf der CD die ebenfall super sind.  Ich liebe dieses Album es läuft den ganzen Tag in meinem CD Player, zu Hause sowie im Auto. 3P ist für mich Deutsche Musikgeschichte, das ganze Team was dahinter steht, angefangen von Moses Pelham, ist einfach das beste was Deutscher Sprechgesang zu bieten hat. Ich bin echt Stoltz aus so einer Hammerguten (Musiker)Stadt zu kommen. Diese CD kann ich absolut empfehlen, ihr werdet abgehen!!!"
5,"Streetpunk wurde schon oft, viel und vor allem auch oft schlecht gespielt... nicht so die distillers.  Die 2te Platte der Distillers ist ein Meisterwerk. Allerdings nach dem Prinzip ""lieb es oder hass es"" Man muss schon sehr auf punk abfahren um diese musik zu mögen, und vor allem auf den Punk in seiner etwas ursprünglicheren Form.  Denn mit dem zurzeit vor allem aktuellen Skatepunk a la Pennywise Millencolin usw(den ich auch sehr gern mag)hat ""sing sing death house"" nun wirklich nichts zu tun.  Die Produktion (falls es eine gab) ist spartanisch, die Musik ist die geballte Wut, sie kocht über vor emotionen, und die alles verdrängende abgöttisch gute Stimme von Brody Dalle haut einen einfach um. Schnörkellos,hart, wütend und ehrlich und dennoch mit einer unglaublichen menge an Ohrwürmern beladen. Nie gleitet die Band in unmelodiöse gefilde ab (wie etwa converge)vielmehr ist jeder Song eine (meist ziemlich melodische) Hymne an den Punk als solchen und vermittelt das Lebensgefühl das bei dieser Musik einfach dazugehört. Die Lieder sind trotz des dem Punk anhaftenden Images von einfach gestrickter Musik nie einfallslos sondern bieten immer eine Überraschung. FAZIT: gut geschriebene Songs toll rübergebracht und mit einer einfach tollen stimme gesungen die man nie wieder vergisst.  Punk wie Drecksau... wer drauf steht: Zuschlagen!"
5,"Ein guter Nachfolger von Christina Milian ist It's about time. Das Album macht Spaß, vor allem Dip it low, der nur ein Hit unter vielen ist. Someday one day ist eine Traumballade, Highway ist ebenfalls ruhiger und mein Lieblingslied. Der bereits bekannte Track L.O.V.E. ist auch hier wiederzufinden und einer der besten Tracks der CD. Get loose und I need more gehen total ab und sind ebenfalls sehr prägend. Nur Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly kann nicht überzeugen,da der Refrain relativ aggressiv klingt, obwohl die Strophen ein Treaum sind und der Refrain nicht ganz dazu passt. Sonst ein schönes Album."
5,Ich finde Brandy klasse. Ihre Soulstimme ist super und ihr neuer Song verbindet Soul und Pop. Man merkt das sie immer mehr über die Musik lernt und sich weier bildet ihre CD's und Songs werden immer besser und deswegen finde ich man sollte die CD umbedingt kaufen!!!!!
5,"Hier haben wir es mit einem absolut wegweisenden Weltklasse-Album aus dem Sektor Melodic-Speed-Metal zu tun. Obwohl sich dieses Werk gar nicht so einfach in eine Sparte einordnen läßt, da sehr geschickt Klassik- und auch Folkloreelemente in die Songs eingearbeitet sind. Dieses ergibt jedoch ein Album von unglaublicher Intensität und musikalischer Schönheit. Man wird vom ersten Ton des fantastischen Intros an in eine ferne Welt entführt. Schon mit diesem ersten Album, daß für mächtig Wirbel in Fan- und Medienkreisen sorgte, schafften es RHAPSODY ein enorm hohes musikalisches Niveau zu erreichen. Man braucht sich gar nicht die Mühe zu machen hier evtl. andere Bands zu Vergleichszwecken heranziehen zu wollen. Die Italiener etablierten sofort Ihren ureigenen bis heute unerreicht gebliebenen Stil. In Fabio Leone (vormals bei LABYRINTH) konnte man einen Sänger der Extraklasse vorweisen, und mit Mastermind Luca Turilli an der Gitarre, der in einigen Interviews unverhohlen seine Bewunderung für Yngwie Malmsteen und einige klassische Komponisten kundtat, hat man einen Songwriter der hier sein Meisterwerk erschuf! Obwohl es dieses überragende Werk einfach verdient hat in seiner Gesamtheit gehört zu werden, da ihm zudem noch ein Fantasy-Konzept zugrunde liegt, hier einige Anspieltipps: „Rage Of The Winter"", „Land Of Immortals"", das wunderschöne, rein akkustisch gehaltene „Forrest Of The Unicorns"" sowie „Lord Of The Thunder"". Besser geht's nicht mehr!"
5,"Und wieder was Neues aus dem Hause Maritim, wieder von Andreas Masruth, dem wir z.B. auch Preston Aberdeen zu verdanken haben. Diesmal ist es jedoch kein Krimihörspiel, sondern der Hörer wird in die Weiten des Alls entführt...bzw. so weit weg von der Erde geht die Reise auch nicht... Was sich im Klappentext schon interessant anließt, das wird auch im Hörspiel nicht uninteressant. Die wirklich gute Story wird durch die einwandfreie Vertonung perfekt dargestellt. Der Hörer wird von der ersten Minute an in das Hörspiel hineingezogen und in seinen Bann gezogen. Sehr gute Sprecherauswahl, mit durchweg bekannten Synchronsprechern, die stimmige musikalische Untermalung und die tolle Geräuschkulisse machen Spaß und vertonen die Story absolut stimmig und gekonnt! Gute Dialoge und der passende Rest sorgen hier für einen tollen Hörspaß, der hoffentlich bald fortgesetzt wird, ich will endlich wissen, wie's weitergeht! Von mir gibt's für SciFi-Fans eine Kaufempfehlung. Ein Hörspiel das bei den Effekten nicht auf Höher, Schneller, Weiter zielt, sondern auf eine solide Umsetzung setzt und damit überzeugen kann. Viel Spaß!"
2,"Nachdem Gabriel Yareds Score verworfen wurde (angeblich wirkte er altmodisch und ruinierte manche szenen sogar) mußte James Horner mal schnell und hastig einen Score schreiben...Was dabei herausgekommen ist? Ein Schluck lauwarmes Wasser oder eben ein überdurchschnittlich schlechter Score! Angesichts dieses Drucks kann man Horner eigentlich auch keinen Vorwurf machen; doch der Score ist nun mal da und er ist mau und fantasielos. Die ruhigen Passagen sind langweilig und unoriginell und besitzen eine sauschlechte melodie. Eigentlich eine Frechheit uns so etwas anzubieten! Überzeugen können die Action-Passagen, in denen Horner ordentlich Pauken und Trompeten benutzte. Das Intro kann man sich auch noch halbwegs anhören, was vor allem dem Frauenchor und der schönen Solostimme zu verdanken ist...aber der Rest...!!! Nun zum furchtbarsten überhaupt...: ""Remember Me"" ist der schlimmste Schmachtfetzen-Song den ich bisher gehört habe. Aber aus einer schlechten Melodie einen Song zu basteln, ist auch schon eine Kunst...!"
1,"Die Aufnahme ist unklar und alle Klänge verschwimmen ineinander. Manchmal läßt sich eine gute Spielweise heraushören, jedoch würde ich vom Kauf abraten wegen des dumpfen Klangs, der nur noch ""Brei"" wahrnehmen läßt."
5,"coronatus versteht es melodischen gothic metal zu machen.die beiden stimmen sind abwechslungsreich und voller power!gut auch, das man mal deutsche töne vernimmt.anspiel tips zu geben ist unnötig, weil alle titel ihre eigenen höhepunkte haben und somit ist dieses album absolut kaufwürdig.ich empfehle den mp3 download!"
5,"Die zweite CD von der Gruppe Edenbridge ist sogar noch besser als die erste CD ""Sunrise in Eden"". Wirklich zu empfehlen!"
5,"Die Cd an sich ist ja schon ein wahrliches Meisterwekr von NIN, aber der 5.1 macht aus diesem Album ein unvergessliches Erlebnis!!! Den vollen Genuss eines Dolby Surround Systems bekommt man ja nur selten. Speziell bei Filmen im dts-Format (welches leider noch recht selten genutzt wird). Doch mit dem Hören dieser CD konnte ich erstmal in den vollen Genuss der Anlage kommen (welche ich nun schon seit gut 3 Jahren besitze!). Man wird beim Hören der art von allen Seiten kontaktiert durch die verschiedensten Arten von Klängen, dass man nahezu eine Gänsehaut bekommt. Besser kann man mit dem 5.1 sound nicht mehr spielen. Man wird umkreist von Geräuschen, plötzlich von Hinten von einer gewaltigen Sound-Welle attackiert (""I do not want this"") Auch denen, die das ursprüngliche Album besitzen, kann ich nur raten diese CD zu kaufen, wenn sie über ein 5.1 System verfügen!!! Der Wahnsinn! Jedes Mal aufs neue ein Wahnsinnserlebnis!"
4,"...genau das beschreibt für mich den Charakter dieser CD. Eine easy-listening Cd mit ganz sanften Drum n bassigem background. Es kommt hierbei gar nicht auf komplizierte musikalische höchstleistungen oder texte an, im Vordergrund steht, dass die Cd wunderbar im Hintergrund laufen kann, ohne dabei zu eine dieser nichtssagenden geplänker-und gedüdel sounds zu werden."
5,"Jerry Douglas ist wirklich ein wahrer Könner. Dies war sicherlich mit Abstand die beste CD, die ich in letzter Zeit gehört habe. Jerry Douglas kommt ja eigentlich aus der Country- und Bluegrassecke. aber hier zeigt der Mann, was er alles kann. Von Track 1, einem klasse erdigen Southern Rock, über jazziges und natürlich auch Country, aber wirklich vom feinsten, wir hier alles geboten. Der Mann hat ja wirklich schon mit den Besten, Emmylou Harris, Bob Dylan, T-Bone Burnett (um nur einige wenige zu nennen) gespielt und auch hier hat er einige gute Musiker um sich geschart. So zum Beispiel: Bela Fleck, Bill Frisell, Derek Trucks. Mit dieser CD hat Jerry Douglas Türen aufgestossen, und ich bin wirklich auf seine nächste CD gespannt."
5,"Ich muss zugeben: Ein ganzes Album, das sich weitestgehend am Thema Kohle orientiert, war nicht unbedingt das, was ich mir von einer neuer CD von Kathy Mattea erhofft hatte. Die Künstlerin (hier trifft der Begriff endlich mal wieder voll zu) hat mich eines Besseren belehrt. Das Konzept geht auf. Das Thema Kohle (Frau Mattea kommt aus West-Virginia, einem der großen Kohlefördergebiete der USA) wird auf vielschichtige Art und Weise thematisiert. Dabei bleibt Gänsehaut nicht aus. Aufgrund der absolut gelungenen und obwohl anspruchvollen auch eingängigen Arrangements (Marty Stuart mischt hier kräftig mit), kommt Langeweile nie auf. Der fünfte Stern wird durch Kathy Matteas Stimme gerechtfertigt. Das ist der absolute Wahnsinn, wohl das Beste, was in Countrykreisen (der Begriff trifft hier auch, aber eben nicht nur zu) und vielleicht sogar darüber hinaus, zu finden sein dürfte."
4,"Ich besitze America's Sweatheart mitlerweile seit Release der CD, dürfte also schon längere Zeit hersein. Sicherlich sind einige dieser Songs recht gut, allerdings merkt man vorallem nach mehrmaligen hören der CD das die Echtheit von Courtney Love doch nicht mehr so da ist wie einst einmal."
4,"Zu diesem Plüschtier kann man eigentlich nur ein was sagen: Sieht total knuffig aus - jeder wird ihn lieben. Einziger Negativer Punkt: der Preis ist relativ hoch, habs aber gerne ausgegeben"
2,"Na ja, das ist sie also, die so sehr erwartete cdm 12! - Ewig lange darauf gewartet und dann so was - die neue Cdm kann bei weitem nicht mehr mit ihren Vorgängern mithalte. Galt die Cafe del mar-Serie vor einiger Zeit noch als Maßstab aller Dinge und schon nahezu als unerreichbar für andere Compilations, so wirkt die neue nur noch als Massenprodukt und wild zusammen gewürfelte Ansammlung von Noname-Tacks! Einzelne Stücke wie ""Jo Manji"" oder ""Blank &amp; Jones"" sind zwar in altbekannter Manier und ihrem unverfälschlichem Sound wieder da, aber die 3 oder 4 Tracks sind dann auch schon die einzigsten Höhepunkte! Die nächste CdM wird wahrscheinlich nicht mehr gekauft, als Ersatz für die Vol. 12 kann man hier dann die Cafe del Mar Aria empfehlen welche um Welten besser ist und durchaus mit den ältern CdM-Alben (Vol. 6,7 oder 9) mithalten kann, oder eben die Klassik Lounge Reihe von Klassik Radio, hier ist das Geld deutlich besser aufgehoben, auch wenn das ""Klassik"" im Titel etwas Verwirrung stiftet, hier findet man noch Lounge und Chillout vom feinsten! Gelungene mixes von sanften, sinnlichen downbeats, chilligen sounds und prickelnden grooves, die größtenteils erstmalig veröffentlicht werden."
5,"Man könnte diese Sammlung unter ""für die Leute, die sowieso schon alles von Bruce Hornsby haben"" verbuchen und läge damit meines Erachtens nicht einmal falsch. Wer sich aber zu dieser Kategorie zählt, sollte sich diese Zusammenstellung auf jeden Fall gönnen. Neben den größten Hits, die hier fast verzichtbar gewesen wären, gibt es jede Menge -- zum Teil auch etwas schräge -- Live-Aufnahmen und Kooperationen mit den üblichen Verdächtigen wie Bonnie Raitt oder Pat Metheny, an die man sonst nicht herankommen würde. Für meinen Geschmack zeigen diese besonders gut die Spontaneität und auch den Humor, mit der Hornsby zur Sache geht und die jedes Lied immer wieder neu entstehen lassen."
5,"was ich da höre! Seit zwei Wochen auf dauerrotation in meinem Auto. Vergesst die Skip Taste, denn diese Band macht süchtig. Wer auf zeitlose Musik steht ist mit diesem Album bestens bedient. Es wird einfach nicht langweilig. Sollte in keiner guten Sammlung fehlen. Genial...,traumhaft...,wunderschön..., John Henry Bonham würde vor Freude weinen könnte er den Schlagzeuger hören!"
1,"Kurz vor Erscheinen der Neuen Live habe ich mit einem Kumpel die besten Bands der Welt analysiert - (nicht im Vollrausch) dort habe ich LIVE als die Band erwähnt, die sich noch keinen Ausfall einer Neuerscheinung geleistet hatte - leider habe ich nicht mit so einem MIST wie dieser Platte gerechnet- so etwas seichtes und Belangloses ist LIVE nicht würdig. Wenn ich an die genialen Platten zurückdenke bekomme ich Gänsehaut - ich  habe dreimal nochmal auf die CD geschaut ob das wirklich LIVE ist oder doch (hoffentlich)nicht - bloss nicht kaufen."
5,"Die 6 Songs fangen langsam an... aber am Ende eines jeden von ihnen fühlt man sich wie nach einer emotionalen Achterbahnfahrt. Die Lieder werden immer gewaltiger, nach und nach kommen immer mehr Instrumente dazu: Streicher, Trommeln, Gitarren, Flöten... Dazu auf den ersten Blick gewöhnungsbedürftiger, jedoch ungemein interressanter Gesang. Das Album ist Ideal für meditative Stunden. Absolut empfehlenswert."
1,"Ich kann mich noch an die schönen Zeiten von ""The Velvet Rope"" oder ""All For You"" erinnern. Das war noch Janets Stil, schöner Soul und ein wenig R&amp;B. Aber schon das letzte Album ""Damita Jo"" war voll mit Hip Hop Dreck. Ich hatte mich schon so sehr auf die neue CD gefreut, aber als ich Sie mit anhörte war ich total erschrocken! Janet hat wohl wirklich ihren Stil geändert! Fast nur Hip Hop Schrott! Ich wollte auch mal wieder auf ein Konzert von ihr, aber wenn sie diesen Hip Hop Mist spielt, bleibe ich lieber zu Hause. Schade Janet du hast dich für mich sehr ins Negative verändert. Ich war 16 Jahre lang ein treuer Fan, aber mit den letzten beiden Alben hat du mich aus deiner Fangemeinde vergrault!"
5,"Ich habe mit dem Kauf dieses Albums lange gezögert, da ich im Radio ihren Song ""Nine million bicycles"" einige Male gehört hatte und ihn prinzipiell richtig geil finde, bis auf den hirnverbrannten Text, der mir Angst machte, das dieses Album voll mit derartigen Inhalten wäre. Das ist nun Gott sei Dank nicht der Fall! Musikalisch bewegt sich Katie Melua zwischen Jazz, Blues und Pop hin und her und weiß die Genres auch musikalisch zu verbinden. Die Songs sind allesamt wahnsinnig schön, haben Stil und Anspruch und wissen wirklich zu begeistern. Da fällt es dann auch leicht ""Nine million bicycles"" zu verzeihen!"
5,"The Cure haben hier eine richtig gute Platte abgeliefert. Es ist mir ein Rätsel, wie man das anders sehen kann."
2,"Den aktuellen Hype um ""La Dasch"" kann ich beim besten Willen nicht nachvollziehen - zumindest nicht, wenn man als Beurteilungsmaßstab ihre sängerischen Qualitäten auf dieser CD  heranzieht: Dasch hat eine recht dünne Stimme, eine mäßige Technik und ein wenig markantes Timbre - alles in allem ist sie eine ziemlich durchschnittlich begabte Sängerin. Diese Durchschnittlichkeit erklärt wohl auch die Auswahl des Repertoires: Schon beim Kauf habe ich mich gefragt, warum die doch relativ bekannte Rossini-Armida ebenso wie die Bravourarie der Jommelli-Armida fehlen. Die Antwort ist einfach: Sie hätten die Sängerin vermutlich überfordert.  Bei der Produktion der Aufnahme scheint die Optik von Frau Dasch die wesentliche Rolle gespielt zu haben, sodass das Cover  daher auch das Ansprechenste an der gesamten CD und damit leider wohl auch für den kommerziellen Erfolg das entscheidende Kriterium ist. Fazit: Eine durchschnittliche Produktion und daher überflüssig, zumal es fast alle Arien auf dem Recital in besseren Einspielungen gibt. Zwei Sterne gibt es nur, weil ich die Idee also solche, ein Album nur mit Armida-Arien herauszugeben, recht gelungen finde."
5,"....macht auch vor Bibi nicht halt. Ich bin 23 und höre Bibi seit Kindertagen. Inhaltsangaben haben die anderen bereits ausfürlich wiedergegeben, ich möchte nur zusätzlich eine positive Rezension verteilen, einfach weil diese es Folge wert ist. Die Geschichte passt auch so gut ins heutige Leben, keiner kann mehr ohne Computer, alle Kinder sitzen davor, dabei will Bibi doch viel lieber draußen spielen... Naja, es kommt wie es kommen muss Bibi verhext sich und dem Zuhörer wird am Rande vermittelt, dass die Computerwelt nicht nur rosig ist. Zum einschlafen eignet sich die Folge sehr gut, keine lauten Babys wie in ""BIBI als Babysitter"", aber auch nicht so langweilig, wie ""bibi- und das Schmusekätzchen"" Weitere TopFolgen: -Hexenberg -neue Freundin -Freitag der 13. -Hexenfluch"
5,Eine schöne Neuerung in der Bibi Serie. Ich habe sie bereit als Kind immer gehört und war schon immer von der Folge mit dem kleinen Hexer begeistert. Der hätte sich prima als Bibis Freund geeignet. Leider tauchte er nur in dieser Folge auf. Nun etlich Jahre später ist es endlich so weit. Bibi lernt einen sehr netten Jungen kennen und er wird ihr Freund. Allerdings passiert das nicht auf ganz normale Art und Weise. Alles beginnt mit geheimnissvollen Briefen. Bibi ist sofort Feuer und Flamme und versucht natürlich herrauszufinden was an den Briefen nicht stimmt oder sollte ich sagen an dem Absender. Hört euch die Folge einfach an - sie ist perfekt!
5,"So hört sich das also an, wenn ""Whitesnake"" sich sozusagen ""nackig"" macht! Da kann ich nur sagen: traumhaft schön! Eine CD für alle, die sich Songs der sonst so rockigen Band auch mal gerne ""unplugged"" anhören mögen. David Coverdale kann sich durchaus auch mal ""ausgezogen"" auf die Bühne wagen (was man beiweitem nicht von vielen behaupten kann). Umrahmt von wundervollen Klängen, die Adrian Vandenberg einer Gitarre entlocken kann, kann ich die beiden wirklich stundenlang geniessen! Einfach traumhaft schön!!!"
1,"Sry, aber besser lässt sich dieser Song nicht beschreiben! Laut Avril wurde der Song geschrieben als sie betrunken war, und das hört man ihm auch wirklich an. Könnte genausogut von Paris Hilton sein. Ich mochte Avril Lavigne zwar nie besonders (vor allem weil so mancher behauptet hat dass es sich hier um Punk handelt!!), und das ist so ziemlich das Peinlichste, was sie bisher abgeliefert hat."
2,"Die Verve Sampler waren für mich die Eingangstür durch die in den Jazz entdeckte. Selbst auf den letzten Sampler waren immer wieder Songs, die einem fernab von Mrs. Jones gezeigt haben, da ist gibt es Insel die man entdecken sollte. Doch was ist das ?? House Musik ist ja schon OK - warum nicht - nun aber diese Ansammlung von Langeweile und am schlimmsten Götzimausi - ohje. Sorry aber da kann man lieber den Sampler der Brigitte kaufen ... Kuscheljazz für Dinner oder für die zärtlichen Stunden mit den Traumman Nr. 7 aus dem Chatroom 99. Beliebigkeit war nie das Ding von Verve nur ihr werden Künstler aufgeführt die eher in die Pop als die Jazz Ecke zu suchen wären."
2,"Sein Vorgängeralbum war nicht schlecht obwohl es ziemlich düster war, aber es gab dort Lichtblicke die beim längeren hören sich offenbarten. Dieses mal bin ich aber enttäuscht. Jeder Song klingt irgendwie gleich, der Rhytmus die Melodie der Gesang... Kein richtiger Hit drauf. Etwas fröhlicher klingt sie, doch zu Balladenhaltig. Da hat der Herbert es wohl mit seiner 12 wohl zu eilig gehabt. Schade..."
2,"Erstmal Kompliment an Michael McDonald, ja, er kann's immer noch, und er kann es mit den alten Motown-Sängern aufnehmen. Soweit, so gut, ist ja auch nichts neues. Aber die Band! Als gelte es, den Supermarkt an der Ecke zu beschallen. Das Schlagzeug klingt billig nach Grabbelkiste, und der Bassist ist fast so groovy wie die Yamaha-Begleitautomatik. Wie man selbst eine Abgeh-Nummer wie ""Signed, sealed, delivered"" so langweilig und stumpf dahinklimpern kann, ist mir ein Rätsel. Der Drumcomputer ist unüberhörbar bei etwa der Hälfte der Stücke - an sich ja nicht verwerflich, aber es gibt Programmierer, die diesen mit mehr ""Seele"" füttern als hier geschehen... Mit Motown-Feeling hat das alles wenig zu tun. Und die einzige Nummer, die richtig schön groovt (""Too high""), bei der auch der Sound passt, findet sich nur auf dem UK-Import. Was soll der Geiz? Beim nächsten Mal bitte auch nicht an den Musikern sparen, Herr McDonald. So gibt's nur 2 Sterne für die Stimme..."
5,"Habe Bebe während meines Spanienaufenthalts öfters im Radio gehört, allerdings immer mit dem Song ""Malo"", den ich am wenigsten mag. Der Rest der Platte ist aber einfach unglaublich gut, insbesondere ""Men senara"" und ""Ella"". So kraftvoll und energiegeladen und absolut umwerfend. Bebe zaubert selbst beim üblichen deutschen Regenwetter immer noch ein fettes Grinsen in jedes Gesicht. Satte Musik einer starken Frau für lebenslustige Menschen und solche, die es werden wollen. Bebe ist eine wahre Bereichung!"
1,"Eins vorweg : Die vorhergehende Rezension ""Helge - What Happened?"" halte ich für außerordentlich gelungen und spiegelt teilweise bis ins Detail meine Meinung zu diesem neuen Helge-Album wieder ( ""scheißegal ... Text vergessen"" : einfach nur noch traurig ). Bis auf den Unterschied, dass ich mich zu 3 Sternen keinesfalls durchringen könnte. Helge Schneider ist ein toller Typ und angefangen von seinen Hörspielen über seine Bücher und CDs bis hin zu seinen Filmen ( auch die, in denen er ""nur"" mitgespielt"" hat ) pflastern ""Helge-Artikel"" meine Regale. ""I brake together"" ist jedoch neben ""Out of Kaktus"" die mit Abstand schlechteste Helge-Platte, die ich mir je gekauft habe. Ich habe mir die Platte drei mal komplett angehört ( war hart für mich ), um eine objektive Rezension schreiben zu können ( an dieser Stelle verweise ich noch einmal auf meine Vorgängerrezension ""Helge - what happened ?"" ). Bei jedem weiteren Durchhören bekomme ich den Finger nicht mehr von der Vorspul- oder Überspringentaste. Mein Fehler : Vor dem Kauf dieser CD habe ich mir die Hörproben bei Amazon angehört. Bereits da kam mir die CD schon schlecht vor. Ich wollte sie trotzdem haben, um auch den Rest zu hören. Es hat sich aber herausgestellt, dass die Hörproben im Prinzip ""der Rest"" sind. Wer also mit den Hörproben etwas anfangen kann, der macht mit dem Kauf der CD nix falsch. Ich für meinen Teil finde dieses Album jedoch traurig und frage mich schon seit einigen Tagen, ob Helge Schneider damit selbst zufrieden ist. Wenn ja, so hat er sich ( musikalisch ) in eine Richtung bewegt, der ich als Helge Schneider - Bewunderer nicht folgen kann und auch nicht folgen will."
1,"Die vorliegende CD hat die an sie gestellten Erwartungen aufgrund der in meinen Augen mangelhaften Zusammenstellung nicht erfüllen können. Tatsächliche drei Hits sind für eine Doppel-CD etwas dünn. Dann scheint man bei den ersten Titeln der ersten CD auch - vorsichtig formuliert - Schwierigkeiten mit der Zielgruppenfindung gehabt zu haben. Ist dies doch nicht die bierseelige Gesellschaft einer Kneipe, sondern junge Menschen, die aktuelle Hits auf einem Sampler erwerben wollen. Das schwammige ""wir haben unser Steckenpferd Techno verloren, Hilfe! Was machen wir jetz?"" Feeling einer Verunsichterten Produzentengruppe ist nicht zu übersehen. Ich empfehle den Besuch der einschlägigen Diskotheken, die Augen vor dem aktuellen Trend Rock nicht verschliessen - Vom Kauf dieser CD rate ich ab - vielleicht wird die 47 wieder besser :-)"
2,"Mobb Deep macht auf einmal Club Music, aha... Mobb Deep ist auf einmal bei G-Unit, aha... Mobb Deep ist nicht mehr Mobb Deep, yapp... So viel gibt es zum Album zu sagen...man hört, dass es G-Unit ist, wer den Sound mag, der wird auch das Album mögen... Wieso zur Hölle muss 50 Cent gleich auf 6 Tracks gefeatured werden? Das Album ist ein halbes G-Unit Album... Wer sich den Beat Creep mit 50 Cent einfallen lassen hat, der muss auch einen an der Waffel haben, aber was solls... Beste Tracks des Albums: Backstage Pass und der Outta Control Remix mit 50 Cent... Fazit: 2 Sterne!"
4,"Wunderbare Zusammenstellung einiger der besten Stücke von Newcleus die im Bereich Elektronik Funk zum Besten zählt was ich je gehört habe. 1984 und 1985 erschienen die beiden tollen LP`s  Jam on Revenge  und  Space is the Place. Soweit ich weiss, sind bis heute diese Scheiben nicht als CD`s erschienen (sehr schade). Von den Instrumenten her, an Kraftwerk erinnernd, allerdings viel mehr Funky und tanzbar, ist diese Musik nahezu zeitlos, einfach geil. Leider hat die Band viel zuwenig produziert. Von den beiden besagten LP`S finden sich mehrere Spitzentraks auf dieser Zusammenstellung hier.  76 Minuten lang, ausgefeilte Beats, geslappte Bassguitar, tolle Melodien, teilweise Sprechgesang. Jam on it ! Viel Spass wünscht Harald aus Köln 2009"
1,"Wenn ich erlich bin ,wird Bushido von mal zu mal langweiliger und schlechter.Der hat nichts abwechselungsreiches.Er rapt immer die gleichen,armen rhymes , immer die gleiche stimme , immer ein ähnlicher Beat. Bushido Fans verstehen nicht,aber ich hab selber mal seine Musik gehört und habe mir gedacht ""Das ist total langweilig"".Der rapt nichts neues . Achtet doch drauf : Immer das selbe. Es gibt sehr wenige Bushidolieder die ich mir anhören kann,aber das waren noch alte Zeiten wo der noch in AggroBerlin war. Also Kurzgefasst : Langweiliges Album ohne abwechselung"
1,Auf keinzten kaufen!!!ist nur noch ein komerz album mehr!!!...das lied erinnert von der art her an electro ghetto also an das album!!!doch fehlt die kraft !!!un der inhalt von bu's liedern is eh immer derselbe: krass ghetto...blablabla...laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaangweilig!!!!bushido was is nur aus dir gewroden???Ich antworte mal so frei:Ein geldgeiles komerz schwein!!!...echt schade...sehr enttäuschend...ich hab mehr von dir erwartet!!!
5,"Der Sampler ist wirklich gelungen! Alleine der Name ""Vendetta"" ließ schließen, was auf dem Sampler zu erwarten ist: düstere Beats, aggressive Lines. Das bietet der Sampler! Wer Partytracks oder ähnlich erwartet, der hat hier Pech gehabt! Die Beats hören sich zum Teil eintönig an, aber wenn es um eine BLUTRACHE geht kann man eben nicht jede Art von Beats verwenden. Wenn man sich die einzelnen Künstler anschaut stellt man fest, dass sich fast alle um einiges gesteigert haben! ich fange mal mit Nyze an. Auf den Tracks bei ""Nemesis"" ist er schon gut abgegangen, aber was er jetzt bringt, istd er  Wahnsinn!! Der Track ""Spotlight"",sein Part bei ""Der Pate"",""Korrekt"" und den anderen Tracks - alles übelst geil! Auf jeden Fall eine krasse Steigerung, man darf auf sein Solo gespannt sein! Dann ahben wir Saad, der mit ""Centercourt"" wohl den besten Track des Samplers abliefert. Das liegt nicht nur an Saad, der auch bei allen anderen Tracks richtig abgeht, sondern auch an dem genialen Beat, den Decay produziert hat! Leider hat Screwaholic für den Sampler selbst nichts produziert, lediglich den Beat für ""Anders"", der auf der Maxi CD ""Vendetta"" drauf ist.   Der nächste, den man unbedingt erwähnen sollte, ist Chakuza! Mit ""V wie Vendetta"" liefert er einen richtig aggressiven Track, womit er andere Rapper in den Schatten stellt! Auch die anderen Tracks wie ""Fliegen"",""Der  Bruchteil einer Minute"" oder ""Vendetta"" verdanken Chakuzas Lines ihr Niveau! Chakuaz hat sich richtig gesteigert, von Nemesis bis Suchen&amp;Zerstören, von da zu Blackout-und jetzt Vendetta! man darf auf sein Solo-Album gespannt sein, dass im März 2007 erscheinen soll! Auch D-Bo, der auf dem Track ""Ich fliege über Rap"" sein 4. Solo-Album ankündigt, liefert geile Tracks und geile Beats! Wer zum Beispiel ""Was ist das"" gehört hat, der weiß bescheid! Nun zu Bizzy Montana..anfangs hat er noch nicht viele überzeugt, nach ""Blackout"" waren dann FAST alle überzeugt, aber jetzt dürfte er wohl allen gezeigt haben, dass er es locker mit bekannteren wie Fler oder B-Tight aufnehmen kann! Bei ""Träne aus Blut"" oder ""Hustle&amp;Flow"" sieht man, wie geil Bizzy abgehen kann! Zu den beiden German Dream-Artists kann man sich nicht auf eine Aussage einigen. Während Eko mit hammer Lines abgeht, z.B. bei ""Was sein muss muss sein"", hält sich Summer Cem eher zurück, und bildet für mich den schwächsten Teil des Samplers! Was man aber zu Eko sagen muss- er wird IMMER BESSER! Bei ""Der Bruchteil einer Minute"", sowie bei ""Vendetta"" und seinem Solotrack zeigt er so richtig, was er drauf hat- weiter so! Zum King Bushido kann man nur sagen- gut, wie immer! Auch wenn er nicht DER Burner auf dem Sampler ist, hat er doch einige gute Lines. Wer also behauptet, dass Sonny Black Geschichte ist, der wird hier vom Gegenteil überzeugt. Der Sampler ist auf jeden Fall sehr vielversprechend, ich kann nur empfehlen ihn zu kaufen! Jeder der eine Ahnung von Deustchem Rap hat sollte diesen Sampler eigentlich kaufen, wenn er ihn noch nicht besitzt. Besonders für Freunde von Battletracks empfiehlt sich der Sampler. Die besten Tracks sind Vendetta,Centercourt,Was sein muss muss sein,V wie Vendetta,Träne aus Blut,Korrekt,Der Bruchteil einer Minute"". Bushidos ""gute Jungs"" verbessern sich von Release zu Release...man darf gespannt sein, was die Zukunft bringt! Bis dahin heißt es: VENDETTA KAUFEN!!!"
2,"Einigie mögen dieses Album mit Ironman oder Supreme Klientele auf eine Stufe stellen, ich tue es nicht! Im Gegenteil, was man hier hört hat fast nichts mehr mit raw sound zu tun. Die meissten songs hier drauf kann ich nicht fühlen, es fehlt an allen Ecken und Kanten. Rza the mastermind ist überhauptnicht vertreten, was schon schlimm genug ist. Und was ist mit den wu elements wie 4th Disciple, Tru Master oder Mathematics? Nee nee  wenn man sich den song Black Jesus vom Ironman Album reinzieht bangt der mehr als jeder einzelne song auf Fishscale word!! Ich bin schon Wu fan seit es den Wu Tang auch gibt, glaubt mir dieses Album ist leider eher nur Durchschnitt nichts besonderes."
1,"Ich hoffe, dass diese gesamte Aggro-Berlin-Nummer in absehbarer Zeit im Sande verlaufen wird, wenn ihre Fans das dreizehnte Lebensalter hinter sich gelassen haben. Erwachsenen Menschen kann man diesen musikalisch belanglosen und textlich indiskutablen Unfug kaum zumuten. Hip Hop ist ja gut und schön, aber dann doch lieber das Original aus der Bronx. Ich frag mich ernsthaft, wer sich diese Art von Mucke kauft??"
5,"Nach dem lyrisch etwas langweiligen, beattechnisch etwas faden und von den Features her extrem enttäuschenden ""Sparring"" wurde von Olli Banjo nun wieder ein Album von der Größe von ""Erste Hilfe"" erwartet, sprich: ein Meilenstein des Deutsch-Raps. Und Olli enttäuscht niemanden. Der gewohnte Mix aus Hardcore-Lyrics, ironisch-frivolen Stories und deepen Versen zusammen mit den abwechslungsreichen Beats und seinem einzigartig-genialen Flow ergeben neben ""One"" und ""Zukunftsmusik"" das beste Album 2005, und es gefällt mir sogar noch besser als die beiden eben genannten. Die Skits sind wirklich lustig, z.B. wird in ""Pimp My Rap"" die bekannte MTV-Sendung aufs Korn genommen (samt dem Moderator Xzibit) oder im ""Polizist""-Skit erinnert der Beamte an eine bekannte Person aus der jüngeren Geschichte... Zu den Liedern ist ganz einfach zu sagen, dass sie alle schlichtweg genial sind und zum Besten gehören, was in den letzten Jahren erschienen ist. Egal ob Olli in ""Nagelbombe"" und dem rockigen ""Wie ein Schuss"" seine Fähigkeiten im Battle-Rap beweist, ob er in ""Pistole"" humorvoll mit dem derzeitigen Gangsta-Rap aus Deutschland abrechnet (Aber wieso ist auf der Bonus-CD dann ein sido-Feature auf ""10 Minuten""?), ob er in ""AIDS"" und dem dazugehörigen Skit auf den Virus'in ironischer aber doch ernster Weise aufmerksam macht, ob er im wunderschön-hoffnungsvollen ""Ich wünsch mir"" mit Xavier Naidoo seine Wünsche erläutert oder im ebenfalls schönen ""Special"" die Menschen ermutigt, Olli überzeugt zu jeder Sekunde. Es ist letzendlich die Vielseitigkeit (neben dem genialen Flow, der für mich mindestens in die Top-5 aus Deutschland gehört, neben Savas, Curse, Samy und Azad), die Banjo auszeichnet und dieses Album zu einem absoluten Must-Have macht. Also: Kaufen, kaufen und nochmals kaufen! Übrigens: Nehmen sie unbedigt die ""Schizogenie Limited Edition"", da hier eine Bonus-CD mit 10 (!) Tracks ist, die allesamt denen vom regulären Album in nichts nachstehen..."
1,"Leider,leider muss ich sagen das die Mannen um Frontmann Johnny Hedlund ein ganz Schwaches Album Abgeliefert haben. Kein Einziger Track zündet. Man könnte meinen ihre Genialen vorgänger Album(Where no Life Dwells,Shadows in the Deep)Hätte es nie gegeben. Ich würde ja gerne euch wenigstens ein Track Empfehlen der dieses Album vielleicht interessant macht.Aber es gibt keinen!!!!!! Wenn ihr die Band nicht kennen solltet dann legt euch lieber die oben erwähnten Alben der Band zu.Den die sind Absolute Klassiker und mit Das beste was der Death Metal hergibt. Auch kann ich euch die neueren Outputs der Band(Sworn Allegiance,Midvinterblot)sehr empfehlen.Denn dort erlebt die Band ihren zweiten Frühling. My BrothersScream For me...Death Metal Victory"
5,"Nach dem in Europa sehr erfolgreichen ""Dynasty"" Album mit dem Megaghit ""I was made for lovin`you"" wartete man schon gespannt auf das nächste Album. Zwar trotz des Albumtitels ""Unmasked"" noch immer maskiert aber wie gewohnt ein erstklassiges Album.  Der Opener ""Is that you"" ist auch gleich einer der Highlights dieses Albums, gefolgt von der Hitsingle ""Shandi"" (absoluter Ohrwurm von paul Stanley). Es folgen ""Talk to me"" (gesungen von Ace) &amp; der beste Song von Gene auf dem Album ""Naked City"". Weitere Highlights sind ""Tomorrow"" &amp; ""What makes the world go round"" beide von paul gesungen. Alles in allem ist dieses Album zwar komerziell ausgefallen, aber meiner Ansicht nach besser als zB Albums wie Hotter than hell, Rock and Roll over &amp; Love Gun, da auf dieser Scheibe viele geniale Tracks oben sind u. zB nicht nur 2 Top Hits wie auf der Love Gun (Love Gun &amp; I stole your love)."
2,"... sondern eher wie ein laues Lüftchen kommt Beenie Man auf seinem neuesten Album daher. Mit dem Major Deal läßt auch die Qualität leider nach. Beeindrucken kann Beenie nur noch mit den Features ( Janet Jackson, Lil Kim), aber das macht die Musik auch nicht besser. Mit Dancehall hat dieses Album nicht mehr viel zu tun..."
5,"Im Januar 1999 brachte der damals noch recht unbekannte DJ, Kai Tracid, sein erstes Album „Skywalker 1999"" heraus. Seitdem ist viel passiert... Die ersten erfolgreichen Singles waren „Tiefenrausch"" und „Destinys path"", die weder auf der Dream Dance noch auf anderen CDs fehlen durften. Danach folgte „Too many times"", was nicht nur weibliche Discogänger vor Drogen warnen sollte (s. oben). Zudem kam die Single „Life is too short"", wobei die Melodie aus der ""Unendlichen Geschichte"" übernommen wurde, was aber dafür sehr gut ankam. Als letztes erschien „Trance &amp; acid"" als Single, blieb aber nur 5 Wochen in den Charts. Diese vier Songs und noch neun (acht ohne Intro) andere sind auf dem Album „Trance &amp; acid"" von Kai Tracid zu finden. Die Spielzeit liegt bei 62+ Minuten, was durchschnittlich bei Alben dieser Musikrichtung ist. Gut ist auch, dass ein Remix von einem anderen DJ (Warmduscher) dabei ist, was das Ganze abrundet. Aber spätestens nach dem Intro kann sich der Hörer nicht mehr von diesem Album reißen und muss es unbedingt zu Ende hören. Dies liegt vor allem an der unterschiedlichen Auswahl an Songs (zwischen ruhigem Trance und harten Acid = Tracid :-). Es folgt eine Titelauflistung, die dies verdeutlicht:"
4,"Im Vergleich zum letzen Album von The Clipse ist ""Hell hath no fury"" eine klare Verbesserung. Das liegt zum einen daran, dass die Jungs fleißig geübt haben und ihren Rapstil auf Vordermann gebracht haben. Vor allem Pusha T spielt auf Stücken wie ""Mr. Me Too"" und ""Ride Around Shining"" seine volle Klasse aus. Malice klingt dagegen leider stellenweise noch immer etwas unbeholfen. Zum anderen haben sich die Neptunes von ihrem sonst üblichen Sound weitgehend gelöst. Einzig ""We got it for cheap"" ist Neptunes-Standardware, allerdings auf sehr hohem Niveau. Der Rest klingt weitaus futuristischer und abwechslungsreicher. Zu den Highlights zählen das schaurige ""Keys Open Doors"", die erste Single ""Mr. Me Too"" und das geheimnisvolle ""Ride Around Shining"". Lahm sind dagegen ""Dirty Money"" und ""Ain't Cha"". ""Trill"", das vom amerikanischen XXL-Magazin zu einem der besten Songs des Jahres 2006 gewählt wurde, überrascht zwar mit einem für US-Hip-Hop ungewöhnlichen Elektrobeat, kann aber genau so wenig überzeugen. Insgesamt ist The Clipse dennoch eines der innovativsten und interessantesten Rap-Alben der letzten Jahre gelungen."
4,"Seitdem ""Let me love you"" auch in Deutschland läuft geht mir das Lied nicht mehr aus dem Kopf, obwohl es ein extrem massentaugliches RnB-Lied ist und somit beinahe dem Pop zugeschrieben werden könnte.  Schluss mit Schubladen!"
2,"Als ich hörte, dass die Jungs von De La Soul ein neues Album rausbringen hab ich mich tierisch darüber gefreut. Ich konnte es kaum abwarten es zu hören. ich habe mir aber eigendlich schon gedacht, dass es nicht so gut sein wird wie ich es mir vorgestellt habe, da meiner Meinung nach fast alles von den alten Leuten in der letzten Zeit rauskommt nicht so gut ist. Ich bin zut zeit echt sehr enttäuscht. Aber zur CD..ich finde, dass die Beats nicht so dem typischen Style entsprechen und auch die Raps nicht. das kann doch nicht sein, dass er da jetz schon halbwegs aggressiv Rap....meiner Meinung nach nich so der Bringer...."
5,"Wenn man auf souliges steht,wird man dieses Album lieben.Es sind aber auch partytaugliche Tracks drauf(Hell Yeah und der Remix). Mein Lieblingslied ist jedoch Big Plans mit Method Man. Ginuwine ist meiner Meinung nach einer der unterschätztesten Sänger im R&amp;B.In den USA steht seine momentane Single ""In Those Jeans"" weit oben,doch in Deutschland bekommt man davon leider nicht viel mit. Daumen hoch für's Album-Eindeutig 5 Sterne!"
1,"ich muss afrob und samy deluxe da schon ein riesen kompliment machen. noch niemals in meinem ganzen leben habe ich von einer cd gehört, zu der der titel so hervorragend passt wie hier. wer hätte das gedacht, dass es so schlechte musik geben kann? die jungs sind wenigstens ehrlich. die reime sind völliger schrott (sie kommen fast an die grauenhafte art und weise, wie samy uns die kunst des freestyle übermitteln will heran) und wenn mir jemand erzählt, dass hier großartige metaphern verwendet werden, dann kann ich dieser person beim besten willen nicht zustimemn. zu all dem übel, dass die beiden selber produzieren kommen auch noch völlig billige featurings, das beste beispiel dafür ist d-flame. man muss sich eigentlich dafür schämen, dass solche leute eine so große fangemeinde besitzen. eins bleibt aber noch zu sagen: es gibt leider noch sehr viel schlimmeres."
2,"Snoop's 2. Album bei No Limit und nur minimal besser als sein erstes. Einige Beats sind schwach, Snoop rappt mittelmäßig und hat seinen Biss von damals verloren. Leider Gottes musste Master P auch noch seine No Limit Soldier auf das Album lassen welche es unnötig nach unten ziehen. Wenigstens sind die Track mit Dr. Dre &amp; DJ Quik gelungen welche auch die Highlightes des kompletten Albums sind. Insbesondere ""Bitch Please"" mit Xzibit &amp; Nate Dogg sowie ""Don't Tell"" mit Warren G, Nate Dogg und dem bereits verstorbenem Mausberg (R.I.P.) sind hier die besten Tracks der CD. Snoop Fan's haben das Album sowieso und die anderen sollten vor dem Kauf gründlich reinhören und sich erst dann entscheiden, ob sie das Album kaufen."
2,"Diese Album hat mich nich wirklich überzeugt und kann weder mit Banks ""Hunger For More"" , noch mit Fiddys ""Massacre"" mithalten.Die Beats sind eintönig und schlecht.Schlicht langweilig.Ich habe mir zuerst YBs neueres Werk ""Buck The World"" gekauft und war hellauf begeistert, jedoch nach dem anhören dieses Album sehr enttäuscht.... Natürlich hängt die Beurteilung der Lieder auch vom Musikgeschmack des Käufers ab, dennoch kann ich vom Kauf des Albums nur abraten..... Auch wenn Buck als MC sehr begabt is und seine Lyrics nicht schlecht sind, wenn der Beat schlecht is kann ich mir den Track nich anhören..... Deshalb empfehle ich gleich ""Buck The World"" zu kaufen, da dieses Album der Hammmer is und wirklich mehr als 2 mal so gut wie ""Straight outta...."" 2*"
2,"Zwei Jahre Warten auf das neue Album von den Spice Girls haben sich nicht gelohnt- ""Forever"" ist bis auf drei Titel ( ""Goodbye"", ""If you wanna have some fun"" und das großartige ""Let love lead the way"") ein Totalausfall, was aber nach der mega-schwachen Comeback-Single ""Holler"" auch nicht anders zu erwarten war. Das die vier Mädels jetzt von Rodney Jerkins produziert werden wirkt sich auf das Album sehr negativ aus. ""Forever"" hat mit anspruchsvoller Pop-Musik, wie bei den ersten Alben , nichts mehr zu tun, hier gibt es langweiligen Pseudo-RnB ! Die Spice Girls hätten sich besser nach nur zwei Alben aus der Musik-Geschicht verabschieden sollen denn diese Cd braucht kein Mensch. Finger weg!"
1,"Bravo Black Hits 8.....nur... warum so alte Tracks von 2002 erst jetzt auf diesem Sampler..und wo ist Whitney Houston,Ashanti und all die grossen Black Hits Klassen ..unbedacht auf den Markt geschmissen,mit ein paar Tracks von Ende 2002 (bis Februar 2003)..das wars... Traurig aber wahr!Ausserdem waru, denkt Bravo immer Black Hits,gleich HIP HOP??? Black Hits auch Soul..doch den sucht man vergeblich...."
2,"Für den wahren Ambros-Fan mag die CD ja schön sein, aber ansonsten überzeugt sie überhaupt nicht. Bei &lt;Ambros singt Waits&gt; hatte sich Wolfgang Ambros so richtig ins Zeug gelegt, bei dieser Scheibe plätschert alles so dahin, ohne dass sich ein Song irgendwie einprägen würde. Sie ist nett aber eigentlich fad, und auch wenn man sie öfters anhört kommt nicht  der sogenannte Aha-Effekt. Eigentlich schade, denn das Können und das Gefühl hätte er eigentlich schon."
1,"Dass Rainhard Fendrich künsterlisch einmal so vor die Hunde geht, habe ich mir eigentlich nie so recht vorstellen können, muss dies aber offensichtlich als traurige Realität akzeptieren. Keine Spur mehr, von dem an ihm so geschätzten dritten Weg zwischen Liedermacher und Schlager, nichts mehr zu merken von dem unverkrampften Humor früherer Jahre und auch nichts mehr zu spüren, von einem Bemühen nach künstlerischer Aufrichtigkeit. Alles klingt inzwischen maßlos gezwungen und gekünztelt. Ob das eine Folge des fortschreitenden Alterungsprozesses des Künstlers ist, wage ich nicht zu beurteilen, muss allerding feststellen, das bei Musikerkollegen wie Reinhard Mey, altern nicht automatisch mit dem Verlust des künstlerischen Anspruchs einhergeht."
5,"Dies ist mein 1. CD von R. Fendrich, obwohl ich ihm immer sehr gerne gehört habe. Vorallem das 1. Song trifft 100% meine letzte Erfahrung mit dem ""starken"" Geschlecht. ""Nur die Liebe zählt"" ist mein 2. Lieblingslied auf diesem CD, es entspricht genau meine Gedanken, meine Empfindungen. ""Die Geisterbahn"", finde ich musikalisch und auch hier den Text, schön, gefühlvoll, romantisch einfach schön. Die Mischung der Musik und der Texte sind m.E. sehr gelungen, dieses CD ist ein Muss, wenn man schöne, unterhaltsame aber auch anspruchsvolle Musik mag."
2,"Ich kann mich dem ein-oder anderen Vorredner nur anschließen. Es ist immer wieder dasselbe bei Mariah Carey. Ein Einheitsbrei hauptsächlich gemacht für die US-amerikanischen Charts. Furchtbar langweilig und einfallslos. Mainstream a la US ohne Innovation und niemals mit Mut und neuer Inspiration. Eine Weiterentwicklung kann man bei ihr nicht feststellen. So stapft sie auf ihren alten Trampelpfaden dahin und ich bin mir fast sicher, dass sie diese auch nicht mehr verlassen wird. Fazit: Langweilig, wie schon seit vielen Jahren."
4,"Wunderbare Musik gespielt von einem Könner seines Insrumets. Einziges Minus - zu viel Programming. Ein Harvey Mason am Schlagzeug wäre vielleicht nicht schlecht gewesen, aber dann wär`s auch schon fast wieder Fourplay. Trotzdem Klasse!!!"
4,"Das ist sie nun also. Die ""Neue"" von Cat Stevens. Warum ich nach wie vor von Cat Stevens und nicht von Yusuf schreibe? Nun, weil ""An other Cup"" eben ein echtes Cat-Stevens-Album ist. In bester Tradition der 70er, also der Zeit der wunderbarsten Cat-Stevens-Alben, von ""Mona Bone Jakon"" bis hin zu ""Numbers"" ist diese neue Scheibe produziert. Wenn man auf die ""Thanks to my musician friends"" schaut wird klar: Die neuen Mitstreiter sind zum Teil die von damals. Alun Daves und Jean Roussel sind z.B. auf der erst letzen Jahr veröffentlichten ""Majikat"" Live-CD/DVD von 1976 zu sehen und zu hören. So sind denn auch die Songs entspannte Folk-, Singer/Songwriter Perlen, die sich hinter aktuellen Titeln der jungen Singer/Songwriter Generation etwa eines Damien Rice,eines James Blunt oder eines James Morrison nicht verstecken braucht. Aber auch in die Reihe von wunderbaren Spätwerken eines Bob Dylan lässt sich die CD problemlos einreihen. ""Midday"" ist ein Opener, der Lust auf Weiteres macht, ""Heaven/Where true Love Goes"" ist er potentielle Hit im Stil eines ""Banapple Gas"", mit den alt bekannten Backgroundchören, dem bekannten Piano und der allgegenwärtigen-Folk-Gitarre ""Maybe There`s A World"" eine einfache, fast schon an Kinderlied erinnende Komposition und so geht`s weiter zurück in die Zeit. Dass diese auch nicht spurlos an Yusuf vorbeigeht, merkt man in Songs wie ""One Day OF A Time"" oder im zumindest musikalisch überflüssigen ""Don`t Let Me Be Misunderstood"", in denen die Stimme schon ein wenig brüchig und etwas wacklig wirkt. Inhaltlich wird das Ganze garniert mit etwas multi-religiöser Philosopie, mit Versatzstücken aus den Weltreligionen, die, so allgemein gehalten, eher das ksomopolitische Anliegen nach ""Liebe"" deutlich machen, denn als Mission für den Islam da zu stehen - Gut so!! Wie gut, dass in dieser hektischen Zeit die Zeit doch noch still stehen kann, und sei es auch nur für knapp 42 Minuten (auch diese Kürze hat Tradition)."
2,"Das Tarja singen kann wissen wir aus alten tagen, in denen Sie mit Nightwish große Erfolge feierte. Die Vorfreude auf ihre CD war dementsprechend umso größer. Voller Erwartung hörte ich mir die ersten Tracks der CD an, nur leider stellte sich kein großer Aha Efekt ein, keine Gänsehaut lief mir den Rücken runter... nein eher Enttäuscht war ich nach dem ersten durchhören.  Über Tarjas Stimme kann man nicht schimpfen. Erstklassig gesungen und in alter Manier. Gesanglich befindet sich dieses Album auf altem Niveau. Aber musikalisch ist es ganz großer Mist. Es ist traurig was dem Hörer da geboten wird. Die Gitarre wirkt so aufgesetzt, es ist fast schon peinlich. Die selben 08/15 Parts, das monotone Spiel durchzieht das gesamte Album. Gute, eingängige Riffs bzw Soli sucht man vergebens, jeder Vorschüler kann das besser. Besonders bei ""My Little Phoenix"" merkt man wie wenig Wert auf gute Musiker gelegt wurde. Ein weiteres Beispiel ist die Coverversion Poison von Alice Cooper. Dieser Song ist eine einzige Frechheit. Nicht nur die Stimme wirkt hier einfach fehl am Platz, auch musikalisch habe ich selten etwas schlechteres gehört als hier. Hier macht sich Tarja lächerlich. So kann man Poison nicht singen und spätestens wenn die Gitarre einsetzt überkommt einen der Drang weiter zu schalten. Es wurde einfach viel zu viel Wert darauf gelegt das Tarja im Mittelpunkt steht. Selbstverständlich bei einem Soloalbum, nur dem aufmerksamen Hörer wird nicht entgangen sein das Nightwish nicht nur aufgrund ihrer Frontfrau so berühmt wurden, auf die sie so oft reduziert wurden. Natürlich kann man hier Tarja nicht mit Nightwish vergleichen. Aber eins ist gewiss: ""Dark Passion Play"" ist musikalisch sehr gut. Ob einem der neue Gesang gefällt ist reine Ansichtssache, während ""My Winter Storm"" sich schlicht im hinteren Mittelfeld befindet. Da kann auch Tarjas Stimme nichts dran ändern. Wiedererkennungswert hat hier lediglich die Stimme und ihr Nachname. Doch gute Musik braucht mehr als das. Ganz zerreißen will ich das Album nun auch nicht. ""Calling Grace"" oder ""Boy and the Ghost"" sind wunderschöne Balladen die durch Piano oder Streicher deutlich an tiefe gewinnen. Doch diese ""harten"" Gitarreneinlagen passen nicht zu dieser Art von Musik.  Wer damit leben kann und nicht etwa die Hoffnung hat etwas auf der CD zu finden was etwa so wie Nightwish klingen könnte der soll sich diese CD kaufen. Jedem anderen der wirklich gute Musik will soll sich an die alten Nightwish - Alben halten. Auf denen ist mehr als genug von Tarja drauf, doch da stimmt das Gesamtpaket. Zur Bewertung:  Gesang: 4 - 5 Sterne Musikalisch: 1 - 2 Sterne da ihr die Balladen durchaus liegen. Die Gesamtbewertung ist mit 2 Sternen ziemlich wohlwollend ausgefallen."
5,"Wer Nightwish mag, der sollte mal unbedingt in ein Album von After Forever reinhören.  Auch wenn ich die Musik Anfangs zwar gut, aber nicht überragend fand, vertiefte sich das Musikerlebnis mit jedem Hören.  Die Abwechslung, die After Forever in ihren Liedern hat, sucht man bei Nightwish vergebens.  So kommt man in ein Wechselbad der (positiven) Gefühle. Mal schnell und laut, dann wieder leise und melancholisch.  Ich kann eigentlich keinen wirklichen Anspieltip geben, da ich alle Lieder sehr gelungen finde und sich das Musikerlebnis erst im Gesamtwerk wirklich entfaltet. Leider sind die CDs von After Forever extrem limitiert. So ist es echt schwierig, überhaupt an eine solche heranzukommen.  Deshalb steigen die Preise für ""Decipher"" in astronomische Höhen, aber es lohnt sich - hört mal rein."
1,"Xandria haben sich eigentlich von Album zu Album immer gesteigert aber ""Salomé - The Seventh Veil"" ist der erste Rückschritt der Band. Das Album soll rockiger und härter sein???? Sorry aber im Vergleich zu ""India"" wurde der Härtegrad auf ""Salomé - The Seventh Veil"" ordentlich zurückgeschraubt, man kehrt zu den Popsounds der ersten beiden Alben zurück was prinzipiell nix schlechtes sein muss allerdings hatten diese beiden Alben eindeutig die besseren Songs. ""Salomé - The Seventh Veil"" klingt einfach in vielen Punkten belanglos und langweilig, gerade diese orientalische Ausrichtung des Albums nervt mich einfach auf Dauer und lässt einen glauben man befindet sich am Kölner Karneval und das ist wahrlich kein Kompliment. Unerträglicher Tiefpunkt ist das peinliche und schlimme ""Sisters Of The Night"" das mit seiner Melodie ohne weiteres als eine Bierzeltnummer durchgeht. Sorry aber sowas will ich von einer Band wie Xandria sicher nicht hören. Auch die groß angekündigt Growls von Lisa in ""Firestorm"" wirken lächerlich (gerade mal für vielleicht mal 5 Sekunden hört man diese) noch dazu da der Song selber sich genauso den langweiligen Ausrichtung des Albums anpasst. Lediglich ""Save My Life"" kann halbwegs überzeugen auch wenn der Song wie eine B-Seite von ""Ravenheart"" klingt aber immer noch besser als der Rest des Albums. Ach ja mit ""Only For The Stars In Your Eyes"" gibt es zumindest noch einen zweiten Song der überzeugen kann was man aber auch den Gastsänger Mika Tauriainen von Entwine verdankt der diesen Song zweifellos zu den interessantesten macht.  Ansonsten kann ich ""Salomé - The Seventh Veil"" nicht wirklich empfehlen, 2  halbwegs gute Songs (die allerdings auch nicht gerade zu den besten von Xandria gehören) sind einfach zu wenig da ist auch nicht mehr als 1 Stern von mir drinnen"
2,"zu allererst: Dies ist keine Rezension im eigentliche sinne. Die Scheibe hat glatte 5 Sterne verdient und ich schreibe das hier nur um auf die beiden anderen 2 Sterne rezensionen eingehen zu können weil es mich rasend macht wenn irgendwelche Leute die höchstwarscheinlich gerade zuhause sitzen und jonas brothers hören hier Mist reinschreiben 1. Das ist kein MH album wie jedes andere. die ersten beiden waren klarer thrash metal und die beieden darauffolgenden nu metal. Das hier ist zwar immernoch thrash ist aber sehr viel grooviger und rythmisch abwechslungsreicher als BME und TMTC 2. Heul und Flenn einleitung und dann bloargh? Machine Head haben in diesem Album wohl noch komplexere songstrukturen aufgefahren als in BME. etwa 95% alle bands können von soviel Ideenreichtum nur träumen. Springt einem nur nicht gleich beim ersten mal hören ins Auge 3. der song heißt ""All fall Down"" 4. Überlang? ich kann mir entweder 3 in massentaugliche länge geschnittene songs anhören oder einen track dieses Albums. Der Ideenreichtum dürfte der selbe sein. Dabei ist nur anzumerken dass auf einem durchschnittlichen Album nicht 30 lieder drauf sind 5. Hype folgen? bitte! seit wann exestiert den ein MH-hype? Außerdem möchte ich noch ein bisschen schleichwerbung für the Blackening machen und darauf hinweisen dass hier im Amazon Musicsampler ein Fehler aufgetretenist: Der song Seasons Wither ist nicht in der Liste Aufgeführt wird aber anstelle von All fall Down gespielt! --&gt; die ganze liste verschiebt sich nach unten und die letzten 3 Songs sind unter falschem Namen! Der 11. track, das geniale Descend the shades of night ist überhaupt nicht zu hören!"
5,"Tja was soll man sagen... Besser waren sie nie und werden sie mit dem ""neuen"" Frontman auch nie sein. Geniale Liveperformance der Fab Four aus Brasilien. MAX IST UND WAR SEPULTURA. Punkt!"
5,"Unglaublich farbige Aufnahme, voller Kontraste und dabei technisch einwandfrei eingespielt.  Tolle Solisten und ein klangvoller, lebendiger und inspiriert singender Nederlands Kamerkoor! Mein persönlicher Favorit. Spannend vor allem, wenn man noch andere Aufnahmen desselben (und doch teilweise so anderen, weil anders musizierten) Stückes als Kontrast hört. Gardiner oder Bernius zum Beispiel.. Darüber hinaus noch ein umfangreiches Booklet, was will man mehr?"
5,"Manchmal braucht es Abstand,um bestimmte Meisterwerke einer Band ausreichend würdigen zu können.Heute einige Jahre später,nach dem grottenschlechten 'Reinventing the Steele',ist Pantera bekanntermaßen am Ende.Das letzte Album war der verzweifelte Versuch,verlorene Fans zurückzugewinnen,die The Great Southern Trendkill nicht nachvollziehen konnten.TGST hat damals was den Härtegrad betrifft neue Maßstäbe gesetzt.Viele moderne Bands aus der Metalcore-Szene bedienen sich folgerichtig heute ausgiebig gerade bei diesem Album,dass bei Erscheinung in den neunzigern doch für einige Verstörung gesorgt hat.Und so spaltet dieses Album auch heute noch die Pantera-Fangemeinde.Heute gibt es auch von anderen Protagonisten der ganz harten Mucke, wie Hatebreed,Mudvayne,The Black Daliah Murder,All that Remains und anderen genug abgespacten Stoff.Doch die tollen Elektronik Arrangements auf 'Living through me' und 'Floods' erzeugen eine vollkommen eigene,abgedrehte und kranke Atmosphäre.Etwas ähnlich beklemmendes und düsteres,habe ich seitdem nicht wieder gehört.Diese Album ist für mich,das wichtigste Referenzalbum der Metalcore-Urväter."
5,"Muss man haben. Die scheibe knallt von vorne bis hinten. Schlägt meilenweit das letzte grässliche St. Anger von Metallica und alles von Pantera. Hätten Pantera so geil geklungen, hätte ich den Hype damals um die Band auch verstanden. So kommen Hellyeah genau richtig und zeigen selbst bei etwas langsameren Songs wo der Hammer hängt, da jeder Song anders ist und nichts eintönig klingt wie manche Möchtergernmetalbands. Also: Supergeil!!! Kaufen!-und besitzen!!!"
5,"Man kann zum melodischen Metal oder Power Metal stehen wie man will. Natürlich reden wir hier von einem mittlerweile völlig überladenem Genre, dessen Reiz im Laufe der Zeit gehörig verloren ging, einige Alben kann, soll und darf man aber einfach nicht übersehen und genau dazu gehören vor allem die Outputs von Tobias Sammet, an dessen überzeugender Kunst, an dessen Genie man einfach nicht vorbeikommt! So ist auch *The Scarecorw* völlig unumgänglich und genial! Sammet befriedigt den Metal Fan mit Anspruch einmal mehr restlos, bietet unverzichtbare Power- Melodic Kost wie sie bereits die ersten beiden ersten Teile des #Avantasia# Projektes ausmachte, zeigt sich darüber hinaus gar musikalisch reifer denn je.  Man muss gar nicht mehr viel erklären, *The Scarecrow* ist unaufdringlich üppig und opulent, ist voll von zwingend grandiosen Melodien und Refrains für die Ewigkeit. Ein wenig düsterer und auch druckvoller geht der Mastermind diesmal zu Werke, webt das kleine Genie aus Deutschland seine hochkarätig und überragend agierenden Gaststars homogen wie eh und je in die ihnen zugedachten Rollen ein. *The Scarecrow* ist ein Meisterwerk, daran gibts nix zu rütteln! Neben einem ein facettenreich wie nie zuvor agierendem Mastemind Sammet, der alle Register der Vocalkunst zieht, brillieren in den Titelrollen der Story ein wie immer grandioser Jorn Lande, ein beschwörender Roy Khan, ein perfekter Michael Kiske, ein kompakter Oliver Hartmann und ein gewohnt charismatischer Bob Catley. Darüber hinaus gibts bei der bombastischen Rock Ballade +What Kind Of Love+ ein superbes und hitverdächtiges Duett mit Fräulein Somerville und einen +Toy Master+ namens #Alice Cooper#, der beim gleichnamig düster und überlangen Megasong mit für eine der besten und stimmungsvollsten Metal Nummern seit langen verantwortlich ist, bei der allein der musical artige Schlussteil Höhepunktsgarantie bietet. Sich in alle Details dieses, aufwändig, abwechslungsreichen und mit tollen Ideen gespickten Werkes zu verlieren scheint völlig unmachbar. Allein der Einstieg würde den Kauf rechtfertigen, allein +Twisted Mind+ und der 12-minütige Titelsong bieten alles was das Herz begehrt. Atmosphäre, Härte, orchestralen Bombast und in die Knie zwingende, völlig kitschfreie mehrstimmige Refrains. Bereits hier muss der Unschlüssige in die Knie gehen und das Testhören zum sofortigen Kaufargument kehren. Wo #Avantasia# drauf steht ist einmal mehr überdurchschnittliche Qualität drin. Es folgt ein um die andere Demonstration großen Songwritings. Egal ob typische Ohrwürmer der Marek +Shelter From The Rain+, +Another Angel Down+ oder der oberfett bombastische Hit +Devil In The Belfry+, es sitzt jeder Ton, es rappelt jeder Chorus im Kleinhirn. Wenn überhaupt kann man an diesem rundum gelungenen Album höchstens die typische Sammetsche Bombastballade +Carry Me Over+ und das zugegeben poppige +Lost In Space+ $(das ein wenig an #Helloween#s viel gescholtenes *Chamäleon* Machwerk erinnert)$ beanstanden. Im Gesamtkontext haben aber auch diese Songs ihre Wirkung und Berechtigung! Genau so muss ein Heavy Metal Konzeptalbum heute klingen, genau so muss man heutzutage fette Chöre, mehrstimmige Passagen und stimmungsvolle Refrains in ausufernde Metal Epen voll orchestraler Diskretion einbauen! *The Scarecrow* klingt düsterer und erwachsener, als seine beiden nicht minder genialen Vorgänger, ist ein perfekt produziertes und in schöner Artwork verpacktes Album, das am Stück gehört seine ganze Pracht entfaltet, dessen Songs aber auch einzeln perfekt funktionieren. Ein weiterer absolute Geniestreich aus dem Hause Sammet und das nunmehr dritte, völlig unumgängliche #Avantasia# Meisterwerk und einer der ersten heißen Anwärter auf die Stockerlplätze des Jahrespolls!  Mehr Kaufargument geht eigentlich kaum!"
4,"Raging Silence klingt nach langer Zeit endlich einmal wieder nach Uriah Heep. Als Bernie Shaw zur Band stieß, erschien erstmal das Live-Album ""Live In Moscow"".  Erst 1989 erschien ungewöhnlicherweise das erste Studiowerk der neuen Heep-Besetzung, die bis heute standgehalten hat. Mit ""Raging Silence"" legen sie einen guten Start hin. Auf dem Album befinden sich genau 4 Top-Songs, die alles das was vorher war (einschließlich ""Equator"") vergessen lassen. Als Heep-Fan also unbedingt zu empfehlen sind: Hold Your Head Up (sehr stark, wenn auch ""nur"" gecovert..., Cry Freedom, Rough Justice und vor allem das erstklassige More Fool You ! Auch ""Rich Kid"" und ""Bad Bad Man"" sind nicht von schlechten Eltern. Wären nur diese Songs auf Raging Silence, würde ich dem Album 5 Sterne geben. Der Rest ist leider sehr ""mainstreamig"", wenn ich dass mal so bezeichnen darf.  Auch geht der Sound auf weite Strecken in Richtung geglätteten USA - Rock.  Zu viel Synthesizer und Keyboard - Kleister. Dies ist heute nicht mehr so mein Ding.  Es passte aber in die Zeit der späten 80er damals. Insofern ist der Mainstream-Touch zu verzeihen. Außerdem hat Mick Box hier definitiv endlich seine Band gefunden, mit dem guten alten Lee Kerslake und dem alten Mitstreiter Trevor Bolder.  Das passt und klingt wieder nach Heep !  Und wie wir heute wissen, ja immer noch !"
2,". . . .,das ""X"" Album von Leppard!! Ich bin seit Jahren ein riesen Fan und habe mich so sehr auf das neue Album gefreut!! Habe sie, die ganzen Jahre, nicht aus den Augen gelassen! Als ich X gehört habe und das Produzenten-Team gesehen habe, wurde mir ganz anders . . . .Britney &amp; Co!! Das darf doch nicht wahr sein??!! So hört es sich auch an : N*SYNC auf Metal!! Jungs, wollt ihr eure Fans veräppeln??? Rober ""Mutt"" Lange war schon genial, oder??? Gebt euch beim nächsten Album mehr Mühe und schreibt eure eigenen Songs, ihr habt es nicht nötig!!! Steven Clark würde sich im Grabe umdrehen!!!! Warte auf das nächste Album, aber behalte es in meiner Sammlung!!"
2,"Es ist immer die gleiche Geschichte mit den verheissungsvollen neuen britischen Bands. Mit ihren Debüts werden sie von der britischen Presse (meist zurecht) in den Pop-Himmel gelobt und schon wenige Jahre später stellt sich das gehypte Ding dann nur als Strohfeuer heraus. So geschehen in den Achtzigern mit den Stone Roses und in den Neunzigern bei Oasis. Kaiser Chiefs gehörten vor 2 Jahren zusammen mit Franz Ferdinand zu den Zugpferden der neuen Punk-Wave-Renaissance-Welle. Und ihr Debüt  ""employment"" war fulminant. Eine Sammlung von famosen Ohrwürmern von fast schon frappierender Einfachheit. Es war ein schmaler Grat zwischen Genialität und Banalität. Aber es funktionierte. Das nun vorliegende 2.Album funktioniert überhaupt nicht mehr. Die Frische des Debüts ist vollständig verloren gegangen, das Genie der Routine und Langeweile gewichen. Es ist keine musikalische Weiterentwicklung, sondern nur uninspiriertes Songwriting.   Selbst die besseren Songs wie ""heat dies down"" klingen wie B-Sides der frühreren Singles. Und wieder einmal hat sich die Tatsache bestätigt, dass ein tolles Debüt-Album noch lange keine tolle Band ausmacht."
5,"Raue Spree Live ist das erste Album das ich mir von InEx gekauft habe und ich bin Ihnen völlig verfallen. Wobei ich sagen muß, daß mir die dazugehörige DVD noch besser gefällt, eben weil mehr Songs drauf sind und das Live-Feeling noch besser rüber kommt. Was kann das noch toppen?? Vielleicht das Konzert am 25.08. das ich kaum noch abwarten kann."
5,"U.K. waren mehr als nur ein Abklatsch von den damals schon verblassten ELP. Die Mannen um John Wetton hatten es allesamt drauf. Da wären Eddie Jobson, einen Mittzwanziger, der es vorher schon mit Curved Air und Roxy Music versucht hat, da aber wohl musikalisch unterfordert war. Außerdem brillieren Alan Holdsworth(ex-Tempest) und Mr. ""Überall-schon-mal-gespielt""Bill Bruford an ihren Instrumenten par excellence. Die Stärke der Platte liegt in der Geschlossenheit der Band, die ihre stärksten Momente natürlich in den Instrumentalpassagen hat. Einen Prog-Klassiker wie ""In The Dead Of Night"" schreibt man nicht an einem Abend...! Die Stücke verleihen dem mitten im Punk erstickten Progessiverock noch einmal wirklche Größe und müssen zum Besten gezählt werden, was jemals in diesem Genre das Licht des Planeten erblicken durfte. Volle Punkte für eines der lebendigsten Progalben!"
2,"...und Neal Morse ist sein Prophet. Lassen wir die Kirche mal im Dorf: man kann es ja persönlich gut oder schlecht finden, dass Neal Morse quasi-missionarisch seine Gottesfürchtigkeit unter die Progisten bringen will; bei der Bewertung von ""Sola Scriptura"" kann dies dem Album schlechterdings nicht zum Nachteil gereichen, denn ""Sola Scriptura"" ist ja gerade ein religiöses Album (oder ein aufklärerisches?).  Bewerten wir daher nur die Musik: was mir als langjährigem Alan-Parsons-Fan sehr gut gefallen hat, ist der Umstand, dass Neal Morse bald hier, bald da Ausflüge in das Musical-Genre macht. Das erinnert teilweise an ""Freudiana"" vom ehemaligen parsonischen Weggefährten Eric Woolfson. Bereits im ersten Stück beginnt ab ca. 9:55min. ein sehr fluffiger Teil. Einfache Gemütern ficht das Arrangement auch nicht an. Nihct so gut gefällt mir allerdings, dass - und da widerspreche ich der Amazon-Bewertung ausdrücklich - die Tempo- und Harmoniewechsel stimmig sind. Ganz im Gegenteil: für die meisten Wechsel gibt es schlicht keinen musikalischen Grund, sie wirken nicht moduliert sondern äußerst gerückt. Wenn man böse wäre könnte man auch sagen: sie sind zweckfrei konstruiert.  Einer meiner Professoren sagte mal: ""getretener Quark wird breit nicht stark"" - da ist was dran. Viele Progger sind offenbar der Ansicht, dass die Stücke alleine dadurch an Qualität gewinnen, dass man sie einfach nur schön lange macht. Hmm, wer hat das längste Stück...? Aus ein paar aneinander gerückten Ideen wird aber noch lange kein guter Song. Dass das Gegenteil möglich ist, hat er doch eigentlich selbst schon mit Transatlantic gezeigt, aber offensichtlich geht ihm nunmehr ein wenig die kreative Puste aus.  Fazit: den Kauf der Platte kann man sich getrost sparen, die Uninspiriertheit der Musiker quillt förmlich durch den Äther. Besser man kauft sich die Transantlantic-Alben: DAS ist großes Kino!"
2,"Mit dieser durchaus respektablen Werkschau hätte endlich einmal die Möglichkeit bestanden, auch in klangtechnischer Hinsicht dieser, in ihrer kreativsten Phase Mitte der 70iger wirklich großartigen Band gerecht zu werden. Leider hat man wieder die in der Branche mittlerweile üblich gewordenen Standards bezüglich des Remasterings zur Maxime gemacht, was heißt: Hauptsache laut, grell tönend, jede Menge Rauschunterdrückung und Kompressoren und damit die Musik jeglicher Dynamik beraubt. Mag schon sein, daß so etwas auf einer 08/15-Anlage oder im Auto nicht auffällt oder gar stört. Es gibt aber auch noch Musikliebhaber, die auf natürlichen, unaufdringlichen Klang Wert legen. Diese Menschen haben sich in der Regel eine entsprechende (nicht unbedingt teure, daß ist nicht das Kriterium !)Anlage zusammengestellt und würden ihre Lieblingsmusik auch gerne in einer guten Qualität hören. Technisch ist das möglich, erfordert aber Sorgfalt. Leider ist das den Plattenfirmen herzlich egal, obwohl ich mal davon ausgehe, daß diese Leute in der Regel die Tonträger auch wirklich kaufen und sich die Musik nicht einfach brennen oder herunterladen. Kommt jetzt möglicherweise arrogant rüber, ist aber nicht so gemeint und mir auch egal. Mein Fazit: Titelzusammenstellung: sehr gut Klang: enttäuschend unterirdisch"
2,"......dachte ich mir, als ich das Vergnügen hatte, dieses Hörspiel dann zu hören. Leider wurden meine Befürchtungen bestätigt. Ich hatte auch nach mehrfachen hören das Gefühl, es hier mit einem Produkt zu tun zu haben, das mehr auch ältere Kinder oder jüngere Jugendliche ausgerichtet ist - aber niemals auch die typische Klientel der DSA-Spieler und Leser, welche meist erst Abiturientenalter oder später zum Rollenspiel kommen. Was aberist die Zielgruppe eines DSA-Hörspiels? Eben - hauptsächlich DSA-Spieler. In dem Zusammenhang hat man ungefähr so daneben gegriffen, wie das ZDF in den 70er Jahren mit der unsäglichen Synchro von Star Trek, das man als Kinderserie behandelte. Dazu kommt dann, das die Sprecher nicht sonderlich motiviert wirken, und der Ton im ganzen nicht so wirkt. Sehr schade, das man eine starke und bekannte Lizenz so an die Wand klatschen kann.  Wie man es richtig macht, sieht man bei den Mark Brandis-Vertonungen. Zwar ist die Kritik beim Hersteller angekommen, aber da letztlich alle 3 bisherigen Hörspiele diese Schwächen haben, bin ich nicht geneigt,einem 4. Hörspiel noch eine Chance zu geben. Schade, das für diese Machwerke die wirklich sehr guten Hörbücher eines anderen Anbieters eingestellt werden mussten."
5,"Wie man bereits meiner Überschrift entnehmen kann, ich fand Carolin war die beste an diesen Abend und hätte es mehr als verdient gehabt Deutschland beim Eurovision Songcontest 2008 in Belgrad zu vertreten, leider kam es anders. Was die No Angels bei mir nie geschafft haben und auch niemals schaffen werden, gleich nach der Veranstaltung habe ich meinen Computer hochgefahren und mir bei Amazon die Singleauskoppelung zu besorgen. Zumindest wollte ich das ursprünglich, als ich jedoch auf deiner Homepage (habe dir einen Gästebucheintrag dort hinterlassen) und auch hier feststellen durfte das man von dir sogar ein neues Album vorbestellen konnte, habe ich nicht lange gezögert und gleich zugeschlagen, denn von dieser wunderschönen - sympathischen Frau mit unglaublich angenehmer Stimme wollte ich unbedingt mehr hören. Heute kam endlich der Briefträger bei mir vorbei und brachte mir unter anderem das Amazon Paket mit deiner Drama CD, habe es anschließend sofort ausgepackt und in den CD Player gelegt. Mein Resume: Wie du schon selbst in der Videozuspielung von Amazon ausgeführt hattest, das Album Drama ist ganz großes Kino  dicke Hose! Sehr zu empfehlen, unbedingt kaufen!"
5,"Mit dieser Singleauskopplung holen sich die vier verbliebenen Engel selbst wieder aus ihrem Tief. Mit der eingängigen Ballade ""Amaze me"", die man zu dieser Jahreszeit wunderbar hören kann und der Covercersion des 80er Klassikers ""Teardrops"", bedienen sie verschiedene Geschmäcker. Weiter ist das Video zu ""Amaze me"" zu sehen. Nicht zu vergessen ""Ain't gonna look the other way"". Dieser Song hat mich doch schon positiv überrascht. Nachdem ich das Album ""Destiny"" eher als altbacken empfunden habe, wartet dieser Song mit überraschender Frische auf. Die Stimmen kommen einem vor, wie zum ersten Mal gehört. Der Song liegt den Mädels wie angegossen und der Ohrwurm ist vorprogrammiert! Nach dem Flop von ""Maybe"" hab ich mir schon Gedanken gemacht, wie es um die Zukunft der Mädels steht und als dann ""Amaze me""/""Teardrops"" als 2-Track angekündigt wurde, habe ich nur noch schwarz gesehen. Aber mit neuem Manager, 2 Editionen der Single, toller Musik, treuen Fans und interessierten Musikkennern, sollte es ihnen machbar sein endlich wieder einen Hit zu landen, der nicht schon nach 2 Wochen aus den Top 10 bzw. Top 20 fliegt. Finde es echt bemerkenswert, dass sich diesmal wirklich Gedanken gemacht wurden. 1 Maxi-CD, 2 Songs und 1 Bonustrack, nicht zu vergessen der schöne Remix von ""Amaze me"" und das Instrumental."
1,"Wenn ich vor die Wahl gestellt würde, was ich hergebe, meine Augen oder meine Ohren, hätte ich im Fall von Tokio Hotel ein massives Entscheidungsproblem, da sie akustisch und optisch schwer zu ertragen sind. Ein zusammen gecasteter Haufen an minderjährigen 3-Groschen-Punkern, denen man kurz vor ihrem ersten Auftritt erklärt hat was eine Gitarre ist und wie man sie richtig rum hält. Rein äußerlich könnte man meinen sie hätten die jungs direkt von der letzten Halloween-Party der Unterstufe entführt. (Eine Mischung aus der Adams-Family, dem kleinen Vampir und Edward mit den Scheerenhänden) Musikalisch passen sich die Windel-Rocker ihrem Look an.. gruselig! Man könnte frei nach Shakespeare sagen ""Viel Lärm um Nichts"" und genauso hört sich die Musik auch an, viel Getöse, viel Lärm, viel Show und nichts dahinter.  Unfassbar, wie dreist unsere Musikindustrie versucht unseren Kids dieses Instant-Image von unabhängigen Rebellen zu verkaufen. Bei einer Casting-Boy-Band!!! Die können froh sein wenn sie alleine entscheiden dürfen, wann sie auf die Toilette gehen und sich glücklich schätzen wenn der Produzent nicht mitgeht. An dieser Band ist nichts echt oder dem Zufall überlassen, das Aussehen, das Image, die Musik.. alles ein Produkt der PR-Abteilung der Plattenfirma. Dann lieber richtige Musik von echten Musikern! Wenn das die Charts anführt, fürchte ich haben die meisten bei der Frage ""Ohr oder Auge"", die Ohren hergegeben!"
2,"...von mir aus hat der eine gute Stimme, und damit umgehen kann er ja wirklich auch. Aber warum motzt die Jury dauernd bei Leuten wie Max Buskohl und Co rum, daß die immer in die selbe Richtung gehen, und dann lobpreisen sie einen Medlock, der ja nu nicht mehr und nicht weniger singt als Soul, Soul, Soul? Cocker, Lionel Richie, und wo ist das breitgefächerte Spektrum, das sie von anderen immer erwarten? Und, entschuldigung, ich kann leider nicht anders als denken, daß die ganze Show getürkt ist, wenn eine wie Lisa Bund, die zwar nicht sonderlich sympatisch ist, dafür aber hammermäßig gut singt (in allen möglichen Genres), gegen einen Martin Stosch rausfliegt? Oder wurde sie etwa nicht gegangen, damit Medlocks Sieg garantiert nichts im Wege steht? Der Song selbst ist ganz eingängig, aber seltsamerweise kaum soulig, daher bringt Medlock ihn nicht sonderlich gut."
2,"also was soll man sagen, ist ja ganz nett gemacht, aber ob bald da noch ein hahn danach kräht bleibt abzuwarten. markybaby soll doch was eigenes machen, bitte schön."
4,"Also ich bin wirklich kein Fan dieser Serie, aber ich muss zugeben, diese Folge gehört zu den besten! Nach der völlig misslungenen Folge mit dem Panik Ferkel, legen die dr3i Detektive jetzt so einen guten Fall vor?! Wahnsinn! Der langjährige Fan wird gewisse Parallelen zu den drei ??? Folgen der rote Pirat, das Geisterschiff und Feuermond entdeckt haben, besonders das mit den  Zombiefilmen und dem Dreck ist ne lustige Anspielung gewesen! Mich wundert ein bisschen mit welcher Lockerheit und Coolness diese Folge daher kommt, als wäre die Folge davor nie gewesen: Humor an jeder Stelle (Peter: ""Grrrrazie"") und (oh, oh, oh) sogar etwas Spannung kommt auf. Ich habe mich sogar diese Mal dabei ertappt, dass ich in Gedanken mitgeknobelt habe, wer jetzt der Täüter seien könnte. Das zeichnet für mich ein gutes Hörspiel aus, man denkt sich in das Geschehen hinein und auch wenn es hier und da noch Verbessungsmöglichkeiten gäbe, ist diese Folge doch eine der besten bisher veröffentlichten, wenn nicht sogar die beste insgesamt?!"
2,"Lieber Produzent, lieber Dieter, ich bin wahrscheinlich einer Deiner größten Fans auf diesem Planeten, aber diese ewigen Balladen machen mich mürbe. Ich bin sicher, dass sich die Stimme von Mark Medlock außergewöhnlich gut mit High-Energy Songs vertragen würde, wie wir sie von Dir aus den 80ern und 90ern her kennen. Und wenn Du uns Fans schon den wirklich großen Gefallen tust Dich wieder selbst vor's Mikro zu stellen, dann mach mehr aus den Tonspuren als in den Hintergrund gemischte Backing Vocals für den Refrain Deines Schützlinges. Bei ""You can get it"" ging es doch auch. Bitte Dieter...laß diese Balldaden sein...das ist nicht das was wir hören wollen, ehrlich. Du kannst es besser...viel besser."
1,"Als Besitzer sämtlicher alten sowie neuen Folgen und treuer Hörer habe ich schon einige Ausrutscher tolerieren müssen. Aber Panic Porky schlägt dem Fass den Boden aus. Es ist die erste Folge, die ich nicht zu Ende hören konnte und auch nicht mehr will. Dieser Panic-Porky-Murks und die nervtötende Stimme entspricht alles andere als einer gelungenen Hörspielfassung. Nur dadurch, dass wir nun neue Namen für die drei ??? haben muss auch nicht gleich die Qualität dermaßen in den Keller gehen. Ich frage mich, ob es keine Person bei Europa gibt, die für die Einhaltung des normalerweise höherern Niveaus Sorge trägt."
1,"Dieser Fall ist eigentlich gar kein Fall. Zumindest kein klassischer Kriminalfall. Es werden Rätsel aufgetischt, mal knifflig, mal banal, die nacheinander abgehandelt werden. Dialoglastig, ohne Action, ohne erkennbaren Gegenspieler. Irgendwann wird dann die Lösung präsentiert und die ist auch noch sehr dürftig ausgefallen. Dieser Plot überzeugt nicht. Die Sprechen spulen das alles souverän und routiniert runter, können aber die dünne Geschichte leider nicht retten. Buchna, der zur Selbstdarstellung neigende Hauptautor der neuen Serie, bleibt auch nach insgesamt drei Folgen eine richtig gelungene schuldig. Schade!"
5,"Wenn man einmal mit dieser Reihe angefangen hat, dann wird man süchtig. 90 Prozent der Lieder laden zum Kuscheln ein und die restlichen 10 Prozent zum Träumen!"
1,"Wenn es noch eines Beweises bedurfte hätte, dass die Skala der musikalischen Geschmacklosigkeiten nach unten völlig offen ist und immer wieder neue Tiefststände anpeilt, hier ist er... Hirnlos trifft es eigentlich nur zum Teil, weil diesem Album darüber hinaus auch noch jeder Funke Inspiration, Musikalität, Orginalität und Feeling abgeht. Erschreckend, dass sich so ein Zeug verkaufen lässt."
5,Ich steh ja voll auf Shrek Filme und die CD zum Film ist echt der Hammer ! Ich muss sie immer wieder hören eine gute Laune Musik für jederman !!Super Titel Auswahl !
2,"Man entkommt ihm kaum, dem Regenbogenfisch. Irgendwann kommt er in jeder Kindergartenkarriere daher, mit seiner Botschaft vom stolzen Schönling, der deshalb von den normalen Fischen gemieden wird. In seiner Trauer darüber geht er zum weisen Tintenfisch, der ihm rät, seine Glitzerschuppen zu verschenken. Zuerst weist er diesen Vorschlag stolz zurück, doch aus unerfindlichen Gründen entscheidet er sich schließlich doch anders und verteilt seine Schuppen. Die anderen Fische freuen sich und tanzen mit ihm. Das war`s. So einfach wie die Geschichte kommt auch die Musik daher. Es ist ein eher einförmiges Tralala in immer dem gleichen, stampfenden Rhythmus. Ja, den Kindern wird hier wenig abverlangt. Sicher, sie können schnell einsteigen und mitsingen, aber die Musik müsste nicht so simpel gestrickt sein. Kinder sind viel musikalischer als Jöcker es ihnen zutraut."
1,"Ich dachte wirklich, dass es nicht mehr schlimmer geht. Nach Songs wie ""All alone"" und ""I#m lovin' l.r.h.p."" dachte ich, das es nicht schlimmer geht. Leider hab ich mich geirrt. Der Song basiert auf einem sich immer wiederholenden Rhytmus und der Refrain ist gut ( nicht von ihm gesungen ). Der Ohrwurmfaktor ist hoch. Das ""STOP"" seiner kleinen Schwester nervt fast so sehr wie er selbst! Ich kann mioch nu wiederholen in dem ich sage, das der Jung einfach kein Talent hat und das Singen lassen soll und zwar SOFORT!!! ----&gt; NICHT KAUFEN!!!"
1,"gehts bei U2 stetig und konstant bergab. Als Fan der ersten Stunde sage ich: Bitte kein neues U2 Album mehr! Harmloses, belangloses Gegniedel, das die Welt nicht braucht. Unverschämte dumme Aaahhhhs und Uuuuhhhs an jeder zweiten Stelle wie man es von alternden Rockstars aller Orten kennt. Ich bin einfach nur noch enttäuscht und gebe nach Jahren (seit Achtung Baby) des Wartens entgültig die Hoffnung auf. R.I.P. U2!"
2,"Ich bin nicht nur Fan der ersten Stunde, sondern habe auch so ziemlich alle Veröffentlichungen inklusive aller Maxis und und und. Die aktuelle CD ist ein Meilenstein in der Geschichte von The Mission. Ein Meilenstein im negativen Sinne.  So sehr ich es mir gewünscht hätte und als Fan eine enorme Frusttoleranz habe: Dieses Album ist einfach schlecht! Es lässt all das vermissen, was die Band um Wayne Hussey ausmacht und immer ausgemacht hat. Es hat keine ansprechenden Melodien (statt dessen weichgespülte Supermarktsounds), es hat keine Härte (statt dessen fällt es im negativen Sinne schlicht nicht auf), es hat keine guten Songs (nach mehrmaligen Durchhören bleibt kein Titel positiv oder negativ hängen), es ist nicht eigen und missiontypisch, die Gitarrenarbeit kaum zu erkennen (statt dessen kopiert sich die Band ein, zweimal ziemlich schlecht selbst und versucht es mit Anleihen an alte Klassiker) und es ist nicht besonders gut produziert (es kling alles nach einem leicht überfrachteten Matschsound, der die einzelnen Instrumente nicht ausreichend unterstützt). Es ist ein Jammer, dass The Mission nicht am positiven Richtungswechsel des letzten Albums festhalten, sondern mit diesem Werk in die Belanglosigkeit des musikalischen Nirvanas eingehen werden. Ich hoffe ganz, ganz stark, dass es ein weiteres Album geben wird. Eins, das an die alten Stärken zumindest erinnert. Viel schlimmer als dieses kann es kaum werden. Die zwei Punkte setzen sich für den Fan wie folgt zusammen: Einer dafür, dass sie noch da sind, einer für Hoffnung auf Besseres."
1,"Ich bezeichne mich selbst schon als ""abgehärtet"", mit den meisten Folgen gehe ich nicht ganz so kritisch um, da ich weiß, dass die Geschichten in erster Linie noch für jüngere Menschen sind. Aber (!) diese Folge hat mir tatsächlich den Atem geraubt - so schlecht war sie.  Die Geschichte um eine Art MMORPG (massiv mulitplayer online role-play game) ist ansich gar nicht schlecht, die Sache mit den Brillen ist mir jedoch noch ein bisschen zu futuristisch. Dann ist es einfach nicht sonderlich spannend, den drei Fragezeichen zu zu hören, wie sie ein Computerspiel spielen. Eine echte Gefahr kommt in diesem nämlich nicht auf. Man weiß auch genau, wie es Enden wird und das nimmt der Story das bisschen Spannung.  Manch einer mag es als ""Neuerung"" ansehen, dass man hier quasi eine Geschichte hat, die mal etwas neues bietet, allerding ist dies derart schlecht umgesetzt, dass ich mich gefragt habe, ob dies überhaupt noch als ""Detektivgeschichte"" zu bezeichnen ist.  Auch die eigentlich nicht schlechte Story um das Spiel und die Finanzierung wird durch das Spiel und seine Umsetzung sehr in Mittleidenschaft gezogen.  Einzig die Musik ist gut."
2,"""Islands"" ist wohl eines der umstrittensten Werke von King Crimson. Bei nicht wenigen KC-Fans rangiert es ganz unten auf der Beliebtheitsskala. ""Islands"" ein ungewöhnlich ruhiges, geradezu zerbrechlich wirkendes Album, seine ""radikale Stille"" ist sicherlich nicht jedermanns Sache. Es gibt einige starke Kompositionen und einige, die wirklich banal sind. Das Album ist ruhig, trotzdem gelegentlich brachial."
1,"Auch nach dem x-ten Hören lässt mich das Lied völlig kalt. Der Rhytmus ist völlig langweilig und der Song bietet kaum Abwechslung. Außerdem hatten sie in ihrer Vergangenheit mehr als genug bessere Ohrwürmer. Ohrwurmpotential ist nicht gleich Qualität. Nach Mutyas Ausstieg befürchtete ich, dass die Band sich künstlerisch auf ein niedrige(re)s Niveau begeben würde, wo die Schlüsselstimme weg war und die Nachfolgerin an diese nicht herankam (damals mit Siobhan und Heidi war es zum Glück anders). Doch ""Easy"" vor einem Jahr überzeugte mich völlig positiv, obwohl Amelle es weiterhin nicht tut. Bei ""About You Now"" kommen meine Befürchtungen zurück. Wenn die Damen nach neuen Stilelementen suchen, dann sollen sie es tun - taten sie schon immer - aber ganz schwache Leistung ist dabei, wenn man seinen Individualismus ablegt und plötzlich versucht, wie andere gerade angesagte Künstler zu klingen (Kelly Clarkson). Klone brauchen wir keine und lieber hört man sich sowieso das Original an. Zum Glück gehört das Lied nicht zu den Höhepunkten des Albums, aber sehr viel besser ist sein restlicher Inhalt auch nicht. Ganz sicher ist, hätten sie mit dieser öden Nummer und nicht ""Overload"" debüttiert, wäre ich nie auf sie aufmerksam geworden."
5,Eine Super CD. Höre die Musik sehr gern. Habe sogar bei meiner eigenen Hochzeit im August bei der Trauung diese Musik spielen lassen. Es war einfach nur traumhaft. Im Dezember besuchen wir das Konzert in Berlin. Freue mich schon das ganze Jahr darauf.Die Musik ist Klasse!!!
1,"Das Rezept ist einfach: von allem ein bißchen was, misch-masch, misch-masch, misch-masch...und fertig ist die Lauge! Zu durchsichtig, rein kommerziell angelegt, aber die Leut' kaufen's! Jo, wos wolln mer denn mehr?"
2,"Niemand, der hier niedrige Bewertungen verteilt, möchte ernsthaft am Denkmal Reinhard Mey rütteln. Das sind alles Fans, die Dutzende CDs besitzen und bereits ähnlich viele Konzerte besucht haben. Aber ich bitte euch Fünf-Sterne-Verteiler! Dieses Album kann doch wahrlich nicht als großer oder sogar größter Wurf bezeichnet werden. Damit tut man doch vielen alten Alben brachiales Unrecht! Dass sich Mey thematisch im Kreis dreht, wissen wir ja nicht erst seit diesem Album, das hat sich schon die ganzen letzten 20 Jahre von Album zu Album deutlicher abgezeichnet, und es sind auch nicht die Texte schlecht, die er schreibt. Aber was ist denn das melodiemäßig? Es ist doch jammerschade, wenn ein guter Text nicht im Ohr kleben bleibt, und das tut er eben nun mal durch sein primäres Transportmittel, die Melodie. Die Melodien auf diesem Album sind so stinklangweilig, dass einem der Staub aus der Nase fällt. Schön, die Alben der späten Siebziger mögen pseudo-perfektionistisch arrangiert gewesen sein, aber sie hatten tolle Melodien in schillernden Arrangements - zugegeben, richtig abwechslungsreich wurden diese erst mit Manni Leuchter. Und auch puristische Arrangements können toll sein, wenn die Melodie stimmt (ich erinnere an das überragende ""Viertel vor sieben""). Aber wer in diesem beliebigen Töne-Aneinandergereihe einen Meilenstein meyscher Studioalben sieht, dem möchte ich zwei Lieder des Meysters entgegenhalten: ""Bei allem, wo keiner weiß, was es bedeuten soll, sagen wir vorsichtshalber erstmal: Das ist anspruchsvoll"" und die brilliante Allegorie: ""Was mich betrifft, ich hab die Faxen satt. Sieht denn hier keiner, dass der Kaiser keine Kleider an hat. Das ist weder neu noch originell, das ist nur beknackt. Seht doch mal richtig hin, der arme Kerl ist splitternackt!"" Nein, beknackt ist Reinhard Mey natürlich nicht, war er nie! Aber er war schon um Klassen besser!"
1,"....und das genau unterscheidet auch die einen von den anderen: Volkslieder sind aus dem Volk heraus entstanden, sie sind somit Volkes Seele und Stimme im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes.  Freuden und Leiden, Wehmut, Sehnsucht, Liebe, Tod und Glaube kommen darin zum Ausdruck - im Text und (!) in der Melodie. Achim Reichel verleugnet letztlich diese Tatsache mit seiner musikalischen Interpretation, bewußt oder unbewußt, gewollt oder ungewollt aber eigentlich auch schon mit dem Titel ""Volxlieder"". Die wunderbare Dynamik, mit der Volkslieder gesungen werden können, wird heutzutage in Unwissenheit leider oftmals einfach nur als ""Kitsch"" abgetan, nur weil unsere Zeit heute allgemein gefühlskälter, liebesärmer, materialistischer und damit insgesamt nüchterner geworden ist und die Gesellschaft damit zunehmend genau den Verlust an Werten erfährt, die in Volksliedern meist besungen wurden. Statt sich offen zu Volksliedern und ihrer schlichten, auch ""inneren"" Schönheit zu bekennen, wird dann aber z.B. Franz Schuberts ""Am Brunnen vor dem Tore"" - wie auf der CD von Reichel - schlichtweg ""verhunzt"", die Stimme klingt dabei noch nach mindestens 1,3 Promille.  ""Der Mond ist aufgegangen"" , eines der wunderbarsten Gedichte der deutschen Romantik überhaupt wird brutal ""verschnulzt"". Das Lied taugt dann nur ncoh als ""Knutschsong"". Mit solchen Versionen der beiden Volkslieder, die hier beispielhaft sind, soll aber wohl auch den Ansprüchen der von Schlagzeug-Geräuschen dauerbetäubten und dadurch in musikalischer Hinsicht ungewollt bescheidener gewordenen Menschen genügt werden.  Damit aber jetzt keine Mißverständnisse entstehen: Hier wird keineswegs eine Lanze für den Musikantenstadl u.ä. Veranstaltungen gebrochen, in denen wieder eine andere ""Klientel"" bedient wird. Nein, es geht darum, daß Volkslieder nicht ""verflacht"" werden sollten.  Aber die Geschmäcker sind halt verschieden - und es sind ja auch nur Volxlieder.... Immerhin verdient Achim Reichel einen Pluspunkt, weil er die alten Lieder wieder aufgegriffen hat."
5,"Willie Nelson, der ursprünglichste Chaot der Country-Musik wirkt auf dieser CD traurig, manchmal müde, resignierend und doch überzeugend gut. Ich kann dieses Werk nur echten Willie Fans empfehlen, für Einsteiger ist es denkbar ungeeignet. Als Fan jedoch gefällt mir der nachdenkliche Willie sehr gut. Wahrscheinlich kommt jeder Star nach 20, 30 oder mehr Jahren im Geschäft an den Punkt wo er sooooo tief wird und diese Gedanken auch musikalisch mitteilt. Prima! Zurücklehnen, entspannen und einfach wirkenlassen. Diese CD wird ihrem Titel äußerst gerecht."
5,"Gut einem Jahr nach dem De/vision mit ihrem Erfolgsalbum ""TWO"" wieder zurück zur voll-synthetischen Musik gefunden haben, gibt's jetzt wieder einen absoluten Synthie-PoP Knüller der feinsten Art. Nach guter De/vision Manier klingen die Songs wieder sehr einfühlsam and ruhig.  Gleich beim Eröffnungstitel ""Sadness"" erlebt der Zuhörer eine kleine Überraschung, da sich bei ca. 02:00 die ruhigen Melodien abrupt zu einem bass-starken, auf einem massiven Fundament basierenden, Sound wandeln. Nach dem Adrenalin-Kick ""Sadness"" folgen einige sehr gute Ohrwürmer die den Herzschlag wieder auf ein ruhiges Maß regeln, bis dann ""Drifting Sideways"" zum Tanzen auffordert. Der Folgetitel „New Dawn"" beruhigt dann wieder und leitet eine Phase der Entspannung und Erholung ein. Hier ist genaues Zuhören angesagt, um die wunderschönen Sounds und Melodien im Hintergrund nicht zu verpassen. Tja und so bleibts dann bis zum Schluss. Im Großen und Ganzen zeigen De/vision mit „Devolution"" was sie einfach am besten können - ruhige, einfühlsame Songs basierend auf wunderschönen Melodien gepaart mit intelligenten Texten zu produzieren. Ein Album, daß perfekt zur doch etwas langsameren und ruhigen Winterzeit passt."
2,"Was gibt es nicht für Coverversionen von Pink Floyd: im Stile von Bossa Nova, Kinderliedern, Reggae, akustischer Gitarre, a capella und und und. Und hier nun die bluesige Version diverser PF-Tracks. Einmal abgesehen von der bescheidenen Aufnahmequalität jamen hier ""Vollblutblueser"" in/von/nach/mit PF-Titeln. Und so ist das hier in erster Linie eine Blues-CD bestenfalls ""based upon the music of PF"". Das ist per se auch gar nicht schlecht, bliebe da bei mir nicht der Eindruck, es hätte auch (fast) jede andere Band ""treffen"" können. Und das wiederum ist mir als Pink Floyd Fan einfach zu wenig."
2,"Ich finde die Folge längst nicht so schlecht wie viele anderen TKKG Fans der alten Schule.Es kommt so etwas wie Pfadfinderstimmung auf. Die Sache mit dem ""ist der Gangster im Haus oder nicht"" finde ich durchaus spannend. Das Yokototi ist zwar etwas abgedreht, aber ein bisschen TRASH Faktor ist ganz unterhaltsam. Was mich eher stört, ist der Spannungsbogen. Zuerst ziemlich lahm, dann ein abruptes Ende. Aus der Stunde Spielzeit hätte man mehr machen können. Ausserdem nervt der Sprecher, der den Steinmetz spricht. Auch die Gangsterdialoge sind natürlich viel zu lang bzw überflüssig. Insgesamt ist sie einfach nur schlechter unteres Mittelfeld, aber keine totale Katastrofe."
4,"Dieses Album zeigt mal wieder, dass Mary von kaum einem Sänger/in zu übertrumpfen ist. Das einzige negative was mir bei diesem Album aufgefallen ist, ist dass Mary bei manchen Songs sehr wenig Musik im Hintergrund hat, und so manchen Songs ""das gewisse etwas"" fehlt. Trotzdem merkt man, dass sie jeden Song lebt und ich kann vor allem ""One"" mit U2 empfehlen, wo sie aus ihrer Stimme alles rausgeholt hat, aber auch Songs wie ""I Found My Everything"", ""MJB Da MVP"", oder ""Be Without You"" sind echte Highlights."
5,"Ich hatte mir erst "" Devil's Ground"" geholt und nun diese Scheibe hier. Muss sagen, dass die hier mir viel besser gefällt. Eine absolute Knallerscheibe und einige richtige Wirbelknacker. Meine persönlichen Anspieltipps: - Rollercoaster - Carniwar - Diabolus"
5,"An alle die immer noch zweifeln, dieses Album ist eines der Besten Alben von Blind Guardian!!! Alle Songs sind von erlesenster Qualität, und erstrecken sich über alle musikalischen Entwicklungsphasen der Band. Selbst die ""barocken"", stark verzierten Songs vom letzten Album, von denen man denken könnte, sie seien zu komplex, um sie Live zu spielen, kommen live erst so richtig rüber. Also,wenn ihr ein besonders gutes Album sucht, dann seid ihr hier richtig!!!"
1,"Nachdem Shaman auch schon gegenüber Supernatural stark abfiel, ist die neue Santana-CD ein Sturz in den Abgrund. Belanglosigkeit jagt die nächste, ""Pop-Sternchen"" geben sich die Hand und ab zum nächsten ""Songchen"". Die CD tut weh."
5,"Diese Cd war für mich das erste Mal dass ich bewusst mit Moby in Kontakt kam, und so ging es wohl vielen! Ich hab sie rauf und runtergehört und inzwischen eine ganze Sammlung an Moby Cds zusammengekriegt; sie hat mir also definitiv gefallen *g* Ja, die Songs wurden ja alle recht bekannt, auch durch die Werbung oder im Kino, vor allem ""Why does my heart..."" steigerte Mobys Bekanntheitsgrad sprunghaft! Witzigerweise wollte am Anfang keiner etwas von der ""Play"" wissen, sie kam erst knapp ein Jahr nach der Veröffentlichung in die Charts! Nun, neben den ""Samplesongs""(mein Favourit ist dabei ""Run On"") finden sich noch weitere sehr ruhige Gitarrensongs darauf. Um das Ambiente gut einzufangen hat Moby den Ton an manchen Stellen sogar ""verschlechtert""; man kann ein leißes Rauschen des Tapes hören sowie seine Mikrostecker und andere Hintergrundgeräusche. Für seine alten Fans eventuell ein wenig enttäuschend, da er keine richtige Richtung mehr verfolgt; er macht sich seine eigene! Und die kann man für sich gestellt wirklich jedem mal empfehlen!"
5,"Zuerst die Klangqualität: Bei allen bisher gehörten Stücken erste Klasse. Die gesamte Sammlung anzuhören dauert natürlich etwas länger. Über die Ausführung der Musik möchte ich nichts sagen, da hier doch zu sehr eigene Empfindungen einwirken und das ein Anderer völlig anders sehen kann. Ich habe bisher alle Interpretationen außergewöhnlich gut gefunden. Froh bin ich über die Verpackung in Papiertaschen, da nimmt das Ganze nicht so endlos viel Platz weg. Nach den ersten genussvollen Stunden kann ich sagen - eine absolute Empfehlung - fast ein Muss. Viel Spaß denen, die sowas in der Sammlung haben. HD"
5,"Normalerweise bin ich nicht gerade Fan der Musik von Blank &amp; Jones, aber dieses Album hat mich neugierig gemacht. Zu Recht! Zum Entspannen - neudeutsch: Chill out - gibt es vermutlich kaum was besseres... Allein die Intros zu den Stücken (Wellen, Vögel, Wasserrauschen,...)  versetzen den Hörer schon an andere Orte. Die Musik passt dann dazu. Meine Favoriten: Breezin' und Angel. Äußerst gelungen!"
1,"Ich kaufe CS seit es sie gibt. Und bin von dem, was in letzter Zeit so abegegeben wurde echt enttäuscht. Volume 42 toppt jedoch nochmal alles. Keine eingängigen Beats mehr, nur noch unmelodiöses Gefiepe!"
5,"D.k sind entlich wieder da,Super.Das Album ist zur hälfte ganz neu und zur anderen hälfte handelt es sich um ein neu gemischtes und aufgenommendes grosse Erfolge Album. Über die Lieder kann ich nur eines sagen,reinhören lohnt sich auf jeden Fall. Einige Titel sind schwungvoll wie früher und andere sehr langsam einige erinnern an '79 andere sind eben etwas Schlagerhafter.Aber ich finde es ist für jeden geschmack etwas dabei. Auf jeden fall sind Dschinghis Khan wieder da und das ist super."
4,"Diese HoP Platte unterscheidet sich im Stil deutlich von denen seiner Vorgänger. Statt heftigen Beats a la ""Same as it ever was"" oder ""Life goes on"", fährt die Everlast Combo hier eher die ruhige und smoothe Schiene. Deshalb würde ich dieses ,vorerst letzte HoP-Album, aber nicht weniger empfehlen. Es ist eben mehr der relaxte Stil, vergleichbar mit dem von Soundsystem. Anspieltip ""Shut the door""."
2,Tja was soll man von dieser CD halten. Der Beastie Boy Fan wird entäuscht sein. Nur instrumental. Kein Lied das herausragt. Kein Lied das man sich merken wird. Wird auch nach mehrmaligen Durchlauf nicht besser. Einfach nur Laaaaaaaangweilig!!!!!!
4,"Der `Prince Of Darkness' ist zurück! Mit `Along Came A Spider' kehrt Alice Cooper wieder zur Konzeptkunst zurück, von der die beiden Vorgängeralben `Dirty Diamonds' und `The Eyes Of Alice Cooper' abgekommen waren. Herausgekommen ist dieses Mal ein schöner Rocker rund um den fiktiven Serienkiller Spider, verkörpert natürlich von Alice selbst. Das Album hat alles, was man vom König des Schock-Rock erwartet: coolen Hard Rock, mit `Killed By Love' und `Salvation' die obligatorischen Balladen und - ganz wichtig - Alice' ausgezeichneten Humor, der sich in verschiedenen Textstellen findet. Mit dabei sind auch Gastauftritte von Ozzy an der Mundharmonika bei `Wake Up The Dead' und bei `Vengeance Is Mine' rifft Slash höchstperönlich. Möglicherweise dem Konzept geschuldet, fehlt der Platte zwar der Über-Hit und vielleicht auch hier und da noch ein bisschen mehr kompositiorischer Feinschliff, spätestens nach ein paar Durchläufen ist man aber auch bei diesem Album wieder im Banne Alice'. Denn eins macht das Date mit Spider auf alle Fälle: Spaß! Die LP selbst kommt im schicken Gatefold mit von der CD verschiedenem Cover. Zum Album stimmungsvoll wunderbar passende Bilder im Innenteil runden das Außen ab. Die LP selbst ist in schicker Milchglas-Optik gehalten. Alles in allem bereits vor dem Hören ein Genuß!"
5,"Durch Zufall habe ich Nils Landgren entdeckt. Eine überaus gute Wiederholung eines Konzerts im TV hatte mich gefesselt. Und nun sind Bilder und reines Hören durchaus unterschiedlich zu sehen. Die Atmosphäre wird in Nachhinein komprimiert und auf das Wesentliche zusammen gefasst. Und diese CD lohnt sich, der Hörgenuss steigt und nun gehört Nils Landgren zu den besten Alben in meiner Sammlung. Jedes Stück bringt Emotion pur in einer wunderbaren Intertretation bekannter Stücke. Die Stücke gehen unter die Haut, so dass der Igel auf dem Cover als eine Warnung zu verstehen ist.  Der Kauf ist ein Muss, nicht nur für Fans des Jazz oder Funk. Absolut empfehlenswert."
1,"Aus Sicht einer Plattenfirma sollen solche Kompilationen die Käufer dazu bringen, weitere CD's zu kaufen - nämlich die einzelnen Alben. Für den Käufer aber soll so eine Zusammenstellung möglichst viele Alben wenn schon nicht ersetzen, so doch zumindest die Favouriten in kompakterer Form auf eine (in diesem Fall mehrere) CD's zusammenbringen. Der ewige Intressenkonflikt, wenn es um ""Greatest Hits"" (wie auch immer sie heißen mögen) geht. Unmöglich die Mitte zu finden, unnötig sich darüber zu ärgern. Man kann es nun mal nicht jedem Recht machen."
2,"Irgendwie denkt man das Cicero dahinter steckt. Einige Lieder zeigen wie Frau wirklich tickt, ansonsten schwach gegenüber den ersten beiden Alben. Ich hatte mehr erwartet....."
5,"die scheibe ist heute bei mir eingetrudelt und dudelt seitdem ununterbrochen. prinzipiell gibt's da relativ wenig zu sagen - einfach nur lässig, das groovt und swingt das es eine wahre freude ist, von scheibe blue bis scheibe green, von les is mo bis evening news. uneingeschränkt zu empfehlen."
1,"...ist eine der erfolgreichsten Reihe des deutschen Fehrnsehns von heute auf morgen quasi :-/ den Bach runter gegangen. Aber was Sie hier sehen oder probehören hat nichts mehr mit der traditionellen und fantastischen Symbiose von BR Space Night - Elektrolux zu tun. Vorbei sind die Zeiten wo einst damals noch recht unbekannte Musikgruppen wie ""Aural Float, Full Moon Fashions, The Sushi Club, usw"" uns mit Erd-Weltraumansichten und elektronischer Musik gemischt um 3 uhr morgens zu faszinieren und träumen wussten! Es wäre darum echt schön gewesen, zumindest eine Abschieds CD unter der Space Night Reihe von diesem Label zu veröffentlichen, aber dieses hat man uns ja leider trostlos vorbehalten. Ende dieser Reihe, die mich zumindest geweckt hat was Fehrnsehn eigentlich bedeutet! Für mich war es deshalb auch ""eine Erlösung vom Fehrnsehn durch das Fehrnsehn!"""
4,"Ella Fitzgerald, eine der grössten Jazzsängerinnen aller Zeiten, im Zusammenspiel mit DER ""one man band"" Joe Pass an der Gitarre. Die CD ist ein Zusammenschnitt aus zwei Livekonzerten in Hamburg (1975 ) und Tokyo ( 1983 ). Swingende Jazzstandards und BossaNovas auf höchsten Niveau, welches Standards setzte im Zusammenspiel zwischen Gitarre und Gesang. Dies ist bis heute bis auf wenige Ausnahmen unerreicht. Zudem sind noch einige Soloaufnahmen von Joe Pass zu hören ( z.B. Wave, Cherokee ). Jazzgitarre auf höchstem virtuosem Niveau. Hörenswert auch das Frage und Antwort- Spiel zwischen Ella und Joe in Once I loved. Allerdings gefallen mir andere Aufnahmen der beiden noch besser. Daher nur vier Sterne."
5,"Also, mir ist es egal, ob auf dem Cover David Gilmour oder Pink Floyd steht. Wichtig ist, was drin ist. Und da kommt mir beim Anhören dieser Musik nur eins in den Sinn: Pink Floyd!! Die beste Pink Floyd Scheibe seit 20 Jahren. Anknüpfend an die Vergangenheit aber diesen typischen und unnachahmlichen Musikstil weiterentwickelnd, schenkt uns Gilmour ein Stück zeitlos traumhafte Musik. Ein Meisterwerk eines großen Musikers, dessen virtuoses Gitarenspiel und wunderbarer Gesang einen verzaubern und entspannen läßt. Alle Songs eine Ohrenweide, von denen ""A Pocketful Of Stones"" und ""On An Island"" und The Blue"" es mir besonders angetan haben.  Großartig!"
1,"ACHTUNG !!! diese cd enthält nicht die originalaufnahmen,sondern dubiose live-versionen in grottiger tonqualität.es wird dringend vom kauf abgeraten.die bewertung wäre wenn möglich gar kein stern."
1,"Nicht dass ich nach so langer Zeit noch auf das dritte Album gewartet hätte, aber Portishead hat mit Dummy nun mal mein Leben verändert und mir neue Musik-Dimensionen erschlossen. Dafür bin ich ihnen heute noch dankbar. Aber die Zeit läuft weiter und Zeit bedeutet eben auch Veränderung. So hat sich mein Geschmack verändert, ich habe mich entwickelt. Trotz alledem gefällt mir Dummy heute noch, es ist zeitlos und einzigartig! Nichts davon ist Third. Portishead klingen hier wie eine x-beliebige Band, nichts mehr zu hören von den einzigartigen Samples früherer Zeiten. Belanglos und uninspiriert."
2,"Was hier im Rahmen von MTV`s Ultimate Mash-Up präsentiert wird, ist schon des längeren als Bastardpop bekannt. Die bekanntesten Vertreter sind ""2 Many DJ`s"", die schon Destinys Child mit 10CC kreuzten. Nichts neues also mit der Kooperation von Jay-Z und LP. Bis auf die Tatsache, dass neben ""Numb/Encore"" nichts mehr interessantes kommt und das Album mit nur sechs Tracks (und einer Bonus-DVD - wer will das sehen?) und 21 Minuten Spielzeit viel zu kurz ist. Und das als teure Neuveröffentlichung. Da kommt man sich echt verschaukelt vor. Wenig Qualität, wenig Masse - aber der Hype funktioniert offensichtlich."
4,"Seit diesem Album hat sich im Elektronikbereich doch sehr viel verändert. Die Rezeptur ist eigentlich simpel: Gesampelte Retrosounds gekoppelt mit neuartigen Synths, Voice Samples und stark verzerrten Rhythmen, die auch wieder am Retrofeeling nagen. Doch alles zusammen ist absolut partytauglich und im Gegensatz zu manch anderen ""ernsten"" Elektroproduktionen sehr leicht verdaubar. Norman Cook (Fatboy Slim) hat für dieses Album wahrscheinlich seine komplette Vinylsammlung auf den Kopf gestellt und das Ergebnis kann  sich auch heute noch gut hören lassen. Fast jeder ""Song"" hat irgendwie einen Hitcharakter und DAS ist heutzutage schwer. Einziger Minuspunkt, nach spätestens vier Tracks ist seine Handschrift zu eindeutig lesbar."
5,"Habe mich eigentlich verkauft und wollte die somewhere in Time kaufen. Als ich die CD bekam habe ich es allerdings nicht bereut. Ich muss dazu sagen, dass ich noch nicht lange Maiden Fan bin. Mir hat sie jedenfalls Lust auf mehr gemacht. Die Titel die darauf sind, haben mir alle gefallen und die CD selber sieht wirklich Klasse aus."
5,"Metal, ganz sicher. Aber wohin genau man diese Gruppe einorden soll/muß (Black-, Death-, Power-,...) ist mir letztendlich egal. Denn ihre Musik ist was Außergewöhnliches. Schwermetal + Alphorn(?) verdeutlichen das. Sie vermitteln eine derart dichte Atmosphäre, das man die Wälder und Berge Transylvaniens vor sich aus dem Nebel auftauchen sieht. Das die Scheibe überwiegend instrumental ist, kommt mir entgegen, weil ich halt auch keine rumänisch kann. :-)"
2,"Ich war sehr gespannt, wohin die Reise von Apoptygma Berzerk nach der zuweilen arg poppigen aber insgesamt recht gelungenen CD ""You and Me Against the World"" (Cambodia ist immer noch eine der besten Cover-Versionen der letzten Jahre!) geht. Schon seit 1993 (""Soli Deo Gloria"") verfolge ich das Schaffen der Band mit regem Interesse, spätestens seit ""7"" (1996) ist die Band nicht mehr aus meinem CD-Player wegzudenken. Dabei hat die Band (oder vielmehr S. Groth) über die Jahre einige Kurskorrekturen in der musikalischen Richtung vorgenommen, ist sich letztlich in ihrer Einzigartigkeit und zuweilen Genialität aber immer treu geblieben. Der Wechsel vom klassischen EBM über trance- und techno-beeinflussten Future-Pop hin zum Mainstream-tauglichen Synthie-Pop war dabei kein Problem. Jedes der Albem für sich genommen war schlüssig und einfach nur gut gemacht. Angefangen beim Songwriting über den Gesang bis hin zum Arrangement hat immer alles gestimmt und ragten weit über das hinaus, was man sonst in der jeweiligen Richtung hören konnte. Nun also das heiss erwartete neue Album ""Rocket Science"". Erst war die Single zu hören, die ich eher zurückhaltend aufgenommen habe. Im Gegensatz zu früherem Material erscheint mir der Song ein wenig zu plump, zu wenig raffiniert und zu einfach und zu sehr auf Erfolg getrimmt. Trotz sehr häufigen Hörens konnte ich nicht so richtig warm werden. Nun gut, ähnlich erging es mir seinerzteit mit ""Kathys Song"", der mir auch eine Spur zu süßlich daher kam. Also Warten und Hoffen auf das Album. Gestern bekam ich dann mit, dass man dank der Segnungen des Internets die Platte schon vor dem offiziellen Start im Internet im Rahmen eines Pre-Listenings bei einm großen, amerikanischen Musiksender (der mit ""m..."") ausgiebig Probe hören darf. Das habe ich nun einige Male getan. Und was mir da zu Ohren kommt, gefällt mir (obwohl ich mich sehr bemühe) leider gar nicht mehr so gut. Was die Wahl der musikalischen Mittel angeht, hat sich im Vergleich zum letzten Album nicht all zu viel geändert und man knüpft klanglich dort an, wo man bei der ""You and Me Against the World"" aufgehört hat. Hier und da kommen die Gittarren noch ein wenig stärker zur Geltung, was auch so angekündigt war, und meine Erwartungen noch ein wenig verstärkt hatte. Auch gesanglich wandelt Groth auf bekannt guten Pfaden. Also alles beim Alten. Fast. Entscheidend ist nämlich das Salz in der Suppe, das man diesmal völlig vergessen hat: Das Songwriting. Die Songs sind weitgehend austauschbar und in der Reihenfolge frei von Höhepunkten. Auch nach mehrmaligem Durchhören bleiben neben der Single nur wenig Lieder hängen, z.B. Pitchblack/Heat Death. Die Songs sind sich einfach zu ähnlich, schematisch zu gleich aufgebaut und einfach nicht ""catchy"" oder abwechslungreich genug. Kaufen werde ich die Platte trotzdem, und sei es aus alter Verbundenheit. Und die Platte wird dank der (mir ein wenig zu) eingängigen Single auch ihren Platz in der Charts bekommen. Im Kanon aller Alben von Apoptygma Berzerk ist es meiner Meinung nach aber dennoch mit Abstand das Schwächste. Zwei Sterne. Einer für die Musik, und einer, weil Apoptygma Berzerk drauf steht. Mehr geht nicht. Schade."
2,"Schade , denn nach dem durchaus und stellenweise sehr gelungenen ""Welcome to Goodbye"" verfallen Rotersand langsam auch in die Belanglosigkeit! War der Vorgänger noch eine innovative neue Sichtweise des EBM machen Rotersand auf ihrem aktuellen Album lediglich EBM Pop und sind daher näher an dieser ekeligen Future Pop Geschichte als an ihren EBM Wurzeln! Sicherlich hört man die EBM Wurzeln noch deutlich an einigen Stellen raus doch während das letzte Album noch stellenweise wirklich Drive hatte ist dieses viel zu zahm geraten! Doch eines ist auch bei diesem Album geblieben: Eine perfekte Produktion mit absolut fortschreitender Soundwand , leider nur nicht packend umgesetzt!"
5,"Echt klasse Single, die Kylie da rausgebracht hat - wesentlich stärker und eingängiger als ""2Hearts"" (obwohl die Single schon klasse war!). Es ist die perfekte Mischung aus Elektro-Pop und Disco-House - das Teil geht zuerst ins Ohr und dann in die Beine! Ein richtiger Ohr- und Tanzwurm! ;o))) Mehr gibt es eigentlich nicht zu sagen - Kylie is back! Und sie ist genial! Kann das Teil jedem nur empfehlen, der auf Diso-Elektro-Pop mit House-Einschlägen steht! Top!!!"
1,"Da es sich auch bei ""So heiß"" und ""Es gibt kein nächstes Mal"" - letzteres eines der besten Lieder der Band überhaupt - um Liebeslieder handelt, welche einen Teil der hier versammelten Titel ganz erheblich übertreffen, ist diese Zusammenstellung nicht nachvollziehbar. Ich kann deshalb nur jedem Interessenten empfehlen, vor einer Kaufentscheidung sämtliche Zusammenfassungen von Liedern der Münchener Freiheit miteinander zu vergleichen, um sich nicht für irgendwelche langweilige Grütze einige der besten Titel der Band vorenthalten zu lassen."
1,"Tja,"
5,"Ich kann diese Doppel-CD einfach nur jedem empfehlen, ich finde alle Songs auf diesem Album einfach nur der Hammer. Für mich absolut kein Fehlkauf!!"
2,"Von dem Bee Gees mochte ich den Song auf jeden Fall, er war super schön zum Anhören. Aber hier muss ich sagen, ist er etwas langweilig! US 5 haben einen Neuen, und ich hätte erhofft, dass sie es ihren Fans noch mal richtig zeigen, indem sie auch einen Megahit machen. Aber ich muss sagen, dass war ein Griff ins Klo! Auch Robin Gibb kann da nichts mehr retten. Vincent wird so in der Vordergrund gestellt, was ich aber auch nicht verstehe, er hat nämlich eine der schwächeren Stimmen der Band.  Fazit: Man kann den Song anhören, trotzdem total öde!"
1,"Was bei der ersten CD noch erstaunlich gut funktionierte - sperrige deutsche Texte und eine ausgefallene Orchestrierung - geht bei Zombi nicht mehr auf. Zu spröde und gewollt sind die Texte, oft mit hölzernen Stilblüten. Vielleicht liegt es auch an der glatten Produktion: man merkt, hier konnte eine Band im Studio einmal so richtig vom Leder ziehen. In der Summe bleibt ein Werk zwischen Kitsch, Empfindsamkeit und Jazzelementen. Schade, hatte mit einer Weiterentwicklung gerechnet."
5,"Diese Musik ist genau das richtige, wenn einem so gar nichts mehr gefällt und die Seele einen Ankerplatz braucht - der Chor singt wunderbar, die Musiker unterstützen auf angenehme Weise, nichts ist schrill oder unharmonisch - eine kleine Auszeit von der Welt, in die man dann wieder gestärkt und mit einem Lächeln im Gesicht zurück kehren kann."
2,"Leider keine Originale, wie alle Ausgaben dieser CD-Serie ""TV Hits Vol..."". Die Nachspielungen erinnern zwar dran, werden Sie aber nicht umhauen. Auch hier kann ich TV-Melodien-Fans nur die Compilation ""Kabel1-Die Originale"" TV-Hits empfehlen. Da finden sich zu 95 % WIRKLICH die Originale drauf."
1,"Hans Zimmer hat ja schon einige gute Scores mit Ohrwurmqualitäten serviert aber was er uns mit Fluch der Karibik 2 auftischen will ist einfach nur noch daneben. Der Sound ist grottig, die Partituren lassen noch nichtmal ansatzweise irgendwelche Themes erkennen und die wenigen Versuche, Themes des ersten Teils mit zu übernehmen scheitern kläglich, vom Timing her als auch von der Orchestrierung.  Ich werde mir morgen den Film in der Vorpremiere anschauen, vielleicht funktioniert der Score ja im Film, auf CD jedenfalls tut er es nicht, im Gegenteil, hier kann man schon bald von Lärmbelästigung sprechen...lol"
1,"Wer nicht genau hinschaut, hat leider Pech mit der DVD. Sie ist nur am PC abspielbar. Wir hatten uns so auf eine schöne Live-DVD gefreut und wurden mit Videos in einer unterirdischen Qualität ""überrascht"". Wer etwas arbeit investiert und die Dateien in ein DVD-Format umwandelt kann sie zwar auf dem TV ansehen aber bei der Bildqualität sollte man lieber auf ein Handy-Display ausweichen."
5,"...so mein Urteil über dieses Album. Was es so besonders macht, sind nicht nur die besonderen, von vielen Einflüssen geprägten Melodien und vielfältigen Arrangements, nein, insbesondere sind es die Texte, die gleichzeitig hochintelligent und doch immer emotional und anrührend sind.  Lieder, die berühren und vieles sagen - so muss Musik sein."
5,"Ihr Auftritt mit ihrem einzigen Riesenhit ""Puppet On A String"" beim Songcontest ist unvergesslich : blossfüssig hüpfte sie frech im Minikleidchen herum und - gewann. Die ""Best of"" war für mich ein überraschend erfreulicher Blindkauf. Ihre einzigartiger fröhlich-unbekümmerter Gesangsstil macht auch all die anderen Lieder zu einem Genuss - und man hört sie ebenso gerne wie ""Puppet""."
5,"Auf der offiziellen Hompage der Rita habe ich bestätigt bekommen, was meinen weihnachtlichen Aufenthalt in Frankreich überschattet hat: Fred Chinchin ist tod! Das Mastermind der Rita ist am 28.11.2007 von uns gegangen! Danke Fred für diese letzte musiklaische Hinterlassenschaft, Du hast einen Platz in unserem Herzen! Hier die Originalmeldung von der Homepage: ""Nous avons la tristesse de vous annoncer la disparition de FRED CHICHIN des RITA MITSOUKO survenue le 28 novembre, des suites d'un cancer fulgurant.Les Rita Mitsouko étaient encore en tournée ces dernières semaines, en France et dans toute l'Europe. Sur la scène de l'Olympia, ce 13 novembre, Catherine Ringer a chanté sans Fred Chichin à ses côtés. C'était le vaeu de Fred."""
2,"Reggae mit irischem Akzent? Bislang hat Sinead O`Connor kaum eine Gelegenheit ausgelassen, ihre Karriere zu ruinieren. So ist auch Bob Marleys ""War"" auf diesem Album zu hören, zu dem sie vor einigen Jahren ein Papstfoto auf der Bühne zerriss."
2,"Diesmal hat es nicht so gut geklappt wie bei seinen letzten CDs. Nach Abhören der Songs stellt sich spätestens beim 8. Titel große Gleichförmigkeit ein, und das betrifft besonders  die unspirierte Begleitung, diese Schrumm-schrumm Arrangements.  Robbies neuer Produzent  ( keine gute Wahl) wollte ihn mit dieser CD  etwas stärker auf die Rockbühne wiefen.... aber nach einer gewissen Zeit ist man nur noch genervt vom gleichmässig lauten, gitarrenlastigem Gedröhne. Der Sound ist weder "" progressiv"" , noch wirklich "" rockig"" . Es fällt auf, dass viele Titel interessant beginnen, aber leider nach kurzer Zeit sofort wieder in dieses schrummschrumm-Fahrwasser fallen. Ein paar  passable Balladen retten das Album nicht vor unzweifelhafter Mittelmäßigkeit. Robbie hat ja durchaus seine Qualitäten, die zum Beispiel bei dem großartigen Song ""Me and My Monkey"" von der  ""Escapology"" CD deutlich werden."
1,"Gut aufgemachtes Cover, tja da riskiert man als Mann dann doch schon mal ein Auge, aber um ehrlich zu sein, was bringt uns ein schönes CD-Cover, wenn die Musik wie ein Rohrkrepierer aus den 80er und 90er Jahren klingt. Die CD-Gestaltung läßt es bereits erahnen, hier wird viiiiel Wert auf Äußerlichkeiten gelegt. Die Musik klingt dann auch sehr tanzbar und hitparadentauglich, und man schreibt sich mal wieder das Wort Retro auf die Popfahne (vor 15 Jahren sagte man dazu noch ""geschickt geklaut""), aber das Produzententeam erarbeitet die Songs mit einer Leidenschaftslosigkeit, die einem glatt an die billig produzierten Sampler aus den 80er und 90er Jahren erinnern... FAZIT: das CD-Cover läßt es schon erahnen, aber die Musik ist dann noch nebensächlicher..."
1,"wem eifert sandylein denn jetzt nach?! bei der single ""unnutural blonde"" sah sie auf dem cover aus wie ""anastacia"" und genauso klang sie, bzw. sie versuchte so zu klingen... nun gehts in die hippe dance/rapecke - da muesste doch auch geld zu verdienen sein. dazu nehme man ein rapper der irgendwas faselt was keiner versteht, aber darum gehts ja nicht. es ist ja sooooo trendy."
1,"1 Stern für das CD-Cover, und nur dafür ! Shania, immer wieder eine wunderschöne Frau. Meine Empfehlung : The Platinium Collection und natürlich UP ! Live in Chicago."
1,"so deutlich wie selten zuvor hatte ich soeben die erkenntnis, dass das ""reinhören"" desto aufschlussreicher ist, desto mieser die CD ist! wie kann man nur die gregorianische musik derartig missbrauchen und verunstalten?"
5,"Also Leute, mir ist schon klar, dass einige von euch anfangs vielleicht etwas enttäuscht über das neue Album seid, wenn ihr den ""gewöhnlichen"" Manson-Stil, wie er z.B. auf Holywood zu finden ist, erwartet. Dennoch sollte man sich die Platte öfters anhören, denn beim 2., 3. Mal (so wars bei mir jedenfalls), wird man förmlich von der enormen Kreativität dieses Ausnahmekünstlers mitgerissen. Die Songs haben Tiefgang, die Texte sind wirklich sehr emotional und ehrlich und beschränken sich diesmal nicht wie früher auf ""gesellschaftskritische"" Äußerungen und religionsfeindliche Beschimpfungen, um es etwas softer auszudrücken. Das war ja auch der Stil, der ihn berühmt gemacht hat und genau das respektiere ich ja an Brian Warner,dass er macht, was er will und sein Ding beinhart durchzieht. Jedoch zeigt sich die Qualität eines Künstlers nicht nur durch ständiges Wiederholen des Stils, sondern dass sich der Artist ständig neuentdeckt, was Marilyn Manson hier wirklich grandios geglückt ist. Zur Platte selbst möchte ich sagen, dass ich der Aussage mancher hier zustimme, dass dieses Album poppiger und kommerzieller als seine Werke zuvor gestaltet ist, aber dennoch besitzen die Songs die alt gewöhnliche und Manson typische Eigenschaft, erst nach mehrmaligem Anhören so richtig zu gefallen, obwohl zwei bis drei Songs (wie z.B. ""Heart-Shaped Glasses"", ""They Said That Hell's Not Hot"" oder ""Just A Car Crash Away"") durchaus beim ersten Anhören schon auf Begeisterung stoßen werden. Ganz groß möchte ich noch die klasse Leistung von Tim Skold, dem Gitarristen und Studio-Bassisten von Manson, herrausheben, der die Abwesenheit von John 5 meiner Meinung nach mit Bravur ersetzt hat. Er ist nicht nur Ersatz für John, nein, er gibt der Musik durch wirklich hörenswerte und virtuose Soli ein ganz neues Gesicht. Doch auch der bekannte düstere Hintergrund ist immer noch vorhanden und ergänzt sich perfekt mit den teils poppigen Melodien. Die einzigartige Stimme Mansons, kombiniert mit dem völlige neuen Gitarrensound, setzt der neuen Stilrichtung noch die Krone auf. Ich kann nur raten: nicht beim ersten Mal Schlüsse zu ziehen, sondern geduldig öfters anhören und sich vor allem nicht vor all den Vorurteilen abschrecken zu lassen, die es über diese LP gegeben hat. Einfach zu Hause bequem machen, den CD-Spieler einschalten und sich vom neuen Gesicht dieses Genies beeindrucken lassen und schon bald werden die hitverdächtigen Songs ins Ohr des Zuhörers vordringen, in dem sie auch ( nach eigener Erfahrung) länger verbleiben werden!"
5,"Dieses Album ist nicht direkt mit seinem Vorgänger zu vergleichen, sehr viele langsame Beladen und eher wenig Rock lastig. Doch die Songs lassen sich alle sehr gut anhören und man kann sehr wohl raushören das die Band was von ihrem Handwerk versteht ! Vor allem der Gesang kann durchaus Überzeugen !"
2,"Soloalben lassen Marketingherzen knüpfen. Im Fall von Destinys Child wurden eng gestaffelt drei Soloalben in umgekehrter Reihenfolge des zu erwartenden Erfolges produziert. Jede der Damen hat dabei etwas aus dem Bandkuchen herausgeschnitten: Michelle gibt die gottesfürchtige, Kelly macht auf bubblegum; und Beyonce?"
5,"In dieser Aufnahme passt einfach alles: von der ersten Note an eine überwältigende Interpretation. Mit Recht ist dieser Tristan die Referenzaufnahme, an der sich alle anderen zu messen haben. Was Windgassen hier auf die Bühne bringt ist bei Gott der empfindsamste, verzweifeltste und berührendste Tristan. Nilssons Isolde ist überirdisch - am Ende verglüht sie förmlich im Liebestod. Brangäne - ludwig atemberaubend usw. Wenn es etwas zu kritisieren gibt, dann vielleicht der Kurwenal von Wächter - der (wienerisch ausgedrückt) etwas ""koffert"" (sprich die Höhen attackiert, dass es schmerzt). Was allerdings wiederum Böhm aus den Bayreuthern (die ja kein richtiges Orchester sind) heraushohlt, das ist einfach - Magie..."
2,"Leider ist der Soundtrack zu 'The last Samurai' nicht in der von Hans Zimmer gewohnten Qualität ausgefallen. Diese Musik wirkt nur während man den Film sieht, nicht wenn man sich die CD einfach nur so anhört. Die Lieder plätschern nur so dahin und wirken wie ein Potpouri seiner bisher veröffentlichten Kompositionen. Diese CD wird wohl in meinem Regal verstauben."
2,"Als ultimativer L.R.B.-Fan habe ich auch zu diesem Werk gegriffen, da ich alle nur erdenklichen CDs der Gruppe incl. Japan-Importe und Greatest Hits in verschiedenen Zusammensetzungen sowie Solo-Alben gesammelt habe. Aber der Knaller ist diese kastrierte Version der Little River Band weiss Gott nicht - es fehlen ganz klar die eindrucksvollen und durch nichts zu ersetzenden Stimmen von Glenn Shorrock, Graham Goble und Beep Birtles. Die unvergleichliche Gesangsharmonie dieser drei Gründungsmitglieder hat Little River Band zu dem gemacht, was ihre Fans so lieben und an der Musik der Ur-Formation festhalten lassen. Also für Neu- /Quereinsteiger besser auf die Originale zurückgreifen - selbst B.S.G. (Birtles - Shorrock - Goble) klingt da noch um Welten besser."
5,"Auf welch kulturellem Niveau sich die Weimarer Republik und insbesondere das Berlin der 20er Jahre bis 1933 befanden, kann man hier nachempfinden. Der Obertitel ""Schwule Lieder"" ist etwas missverständlich, da die Sammlung zwar hauptsächlich schwule Lieder enthält, die Sammlung aber darüber hinaus geht. Man hat bisweilen den Eindruck, dass hier eine ganze Reihe der Perlen an Chansonaufnahmen der Weimarer Republik versammelt sind. So gehören Otto Reutters berühmtes ""Hirschfeld Lied"", die ""ofenrohr-Verse"" von Hans Blädel sowie auch die Persiflage auf Bizets Habanera ""An allem sind die Juden schuld"" wie ""Der Marsch ins dritte Reich"" von Ernst Busch zu den kulturellen Eckpunkten der Zeitgeschichte (Blädels Aufnahme stammt gar von 1906). Aber auch die schwulen Lieder sind nicht nur für Schwule interessant, im Gegenteil. Selten hat man so erfrischende Arrangements (meist Bläser) voller Witz und Esprit auf einer Platte gehört. ""Ich reiß mir eine Wimper aus"" oder ""So ein Jägersmann"" haben absolute Ohrwurmqualitäten. Den Aufnahmen hört man natürlich an, dass sie nicht frisch abgemischt wurden, aber die Klangqualität ist einwandfrei, was man von anderen Aufnahmen dieser Zeit nicht immer behaupten kann. Kurz: ein ungetrübtes Vergnügen, unbedingt zu empfehlen."
4,"Erst kürzlich wurde der 75. Geburtstag von Karl Ridderbusch mit viel zu wenig öffentlicher Beachtung begangen. Auf dieser CD sind viele der besten Aufnahmen des Sängers enthalten. Alles stimmschön gesungen. Was fehlt und vielleicht zur unterschätzten Bedeutung des Bassisten führt ist das Spezielle, Charakteristische, Besondere in Vortrag, Ausstrahlung und Darstellung, Qualitäten, die Kurt Moll und vor allem der überragende Gottlob Frick eindrucksvoll verkörperten."
5,"Bevor sie als international anerkannte Jazzinterpretin Riesenerfolge feierte, war Greetje Kauffeld nicht nur ihn ihrer niederländischen Heimat, sondern auch in Deutschland eine gefragte Schlagersängerin. Die Compact Disc JEDEN TAG DA LIEB ICH DICH EIN KLEINES BISSCHEN MEHR versammelt Greetjes erfolgreichste deutsche Hits aus ihren Polydor- und Columbia-Jahren, darunter auch das unvergessene WIR KÖNNEN UNS NUR BRIEFE SCHREIBEN. Abgerundet wird die CD durch einige reine Albumtracks, die bereits damals Greetjes Neigungen zum Jazz erkennen ließen, sowie durch einige Duette mit Paul Kuhn (u. a. I LOVE YOU - VERGISS NICHT ICH LIEB DICH und JA NUR BEI DIR FÜHL ICH MICH ZUHAUS), durch die beide Stars zwar weit unter Wert verkauft werden, die aber dennoch ganz amüsant sind. Insgesamt ist diese CD das Porträt einer Sängerin, die es wie nur wenige geschafft hat, neben den wirklichen Glanznummern (Anspieltipp: NUR EINE SCHLECHTE KOPIE) auch die von Produzentenseite aufdiktieren schwächeren Songs ihres Repertoires überzeugend zu verkaufen. Und von diesen Sängerinnen gab (und gibt) es leider viel zu wenige."
5,"Das ist sie also ... die anderthalb Jahrzenhnte unter Verschluß gehaltene ""Silberne Cassette""."
5,"Das Album ist ohne Worte, EIN GEILES STÜCK! Stück bezogen aufs Album! Ich finde es super und total gelungen!"
4,"""Beethoven's Last Night"" ist das 3. Projekt des Savatage-Ablegers Trans Siberian Orchestra. Wer schon die beiden Weihnachtsplatten ""Christmas Eve and other Stories""(*****) und  ""The Christmas Attic""(***1/2) mochte, wird hier wieder bestens  bedient: bekannte klassische Versatzstücke werden gekonnt zitiert, neu  arrangiert und von einer exzellenten Musikercrew perfekt im bombastischen  Hardrock-Sound präsentiert. Lediglich die Auswahl der Sänger/innen ist  nicht mehr so vielseitig wie bei den Vorgängerplatten - Jody Ashworth als  Beethoven und Jon Oliva als Mephistopheles sind brilliant, aber die Songs  in denen Patti Russo als Theresa auftritt klingen doch etwas zusehr nach  Bonnie Tyler/Jim Steinman/Meat Loaf. Da ihre 3 Auftritte zwischen Track 10  und 15 kurz hintereinander liegen, hängt da die Scheibe etwas durch (daher  auch nur 4 Sterne). Jeder der Rockopern und Rockmusicals mag ist diese CD  wärmstens ans Herz gelegt - wer es weniger theatralisch und dafür etwas  härter mag, sollte mal die SAVATAGE Konzeptalben ""Dead Winter  Dead"" und ""The Wake Of Magellan"" (gleiche Komponisten und  Musiker, aber nur zwei Lead-Sänger) antesten."
5,"Closing Time ist Tom Waits Debut-Album, doch obwohl ich dazu schon ganz anderes gehört habe, besitzt es viele Qualitätsmerkmale seiner späteren Werke, wenngleich hier seine Stimme noch nicht vom Suff und Zigarettenkonsum zerfressen ist. Aber er präsentiert sich darauf bereits als grandioser Songwriter, der wunderschöne und unendlich traurige Songs schreiben kann. Herausragend in dieser Hinsicht sind sicherlich ""I Hope That I Don't Fall In Love With You"", ""Martha"" und ""Grapefruit Moon""."
1,"Es ist wieder mal Ballermann-Zeit, aber die so getaufte CD lässt im nüchternen Zusatdn doch sehr zu wünschen übrig."
5,"War von der Lieferung total begeistert. Wie beschrieben. Nichts kaputt. Wie neu. Der Verkäufer bekommt von mir die beste Rezension. Bin wirklich fasziniert. Verkäufer hat gehalten, was er über die CD versprochen hat. Kann man zu 100 % weiterempfehlen."
1,"Jetzt denken mansche,Die hat doch an allem was auszusetzen.Nunja ist eigentlich echt so.Ich Wünsche Britney echr nur das beste,aber sowas geht nicht.In Ihrem Video ludert sie echt nurnoch rum bei diesem song.Sie sollte sich Hilfe nehmen und die Musik erstmal aufgeben.Man sieht einfach auch bei ihrem gesang das es nicht die alte britney ist."
5,"Mir persönlich gefielen die bisherigen Songs immer super, deswegen erwarte ich das von den neuen Songs auch. Das ist zwar nur ne Maxi, aber das Album soll laut meinen Infos auch nicht lang auf sich warten lassen! Diese CD hat brandneue Songs, keine Remixes, die aber auch vom Feinsten waren!Ich erwarte kaum noch den Release!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Wer Paul Oakenfold als DJ aus der Trance-Szene kennengelernt hat, wird von dieser Platte sehr enttäuscht sein. Herr Oakenfold geht hier viele neue Wege, die seinen alten Fans sonderbar vorkommen werden."
1,"Wer diese CD unbedingt haben will soll sie sich kaufen, er darf sich aber anschließend nicht darüber beschweren das seine Restmülltonne voller wird. Nicht wirklich für mich überzeugend."
2,"Als ich zum ersten Mal von Sigur Ros hörte, dachte ich ihre Musik könnte die heutige, triste Popkultur wirklich bereichern. Radiohead Frontmann Thom Yorke äußerte sich begeistert, Medienhype überall."
1,"Meisterwerk? Nee, es kommt totale Langeweile auf. Die Melodiestruktur des ersten Stückes zieht sich über die gesamte CD. Klingt wie eine XXL-Maxi-CD. Und dieser stoische Gesang: Ebenso langweilig. Von Harmonien keine Spur."
2,"Es stimmt schon: Wer Blur mag, wird diese CD lieben. Das ist zwar nicht bei jeder Best Of CD einer Band so, dennoch generell recht wahrscheinlich. Ich fragte mich nun: Was ist mit jenen, die Blur (noch) nicht mögen bzw. gar nicht so richtig kennen. So ließ ich mich auf das Experiment ein, Blur eine faire Chance zu geben. Ich war enttäuscht. Viel zu poppig mit nur vereinzelten Lichtblicken auf der ganzen CD. Wie gesagt: Diese CD gefällt einem Blur-Fan mit Sicherheit. Ich bin aber leider noch immer kein solcher."
2,"50 % der Scheibe sind Glanz (die Lieder vor Quarry) und die restlichen 50 % stammen von Quarry und Ringleader - die beiden schwächsten Alben Morrisseys überhaupt, beide auch mit einem bekloppten Cover. Die letzte wirklich sehr gute Morrissey-Platte war Maladjusted - hier war Morrissey noch sophisticated, hier war er noch unser MOZ. Wenn schon eine Das-Beste-Platte dann empfehle ich ganz klar The Best of, weil man hier wunderbare Lieder wie Boxers oder Sunny aus Morrisseys bester Zeit nach The Smiths findet. Auch die beiden neuen Lieder sind eher eine Enttäuschung. Sie erreichen nicht einmal B-Seiten Qualität, vor Quarry wohlgemerkt! Zumindest werden die Cover wieder besser. Nach lächerlichen Posen mit Knarre, Geige oder Softeis, sieht man nun wieder schöne Schwarz-Weiß-Aufnahmen, ältere zwar aber sehr schön.  MEINE MORRISSEY CHARTS, inkl. Live Alben 1. Vauxhall &amp; I 2. Maladjusted 3. Viva Hate 4. Bona Drag 5. Kill Uncle 6. Your Arsenal 7. Southpaw Grammar 8. World Of Morrissey 9. Beethoven Was Deaf 10. You Are The Quarry 11. Live At Earls Court 12. Ringleader Of The Tormentors"
4,"Als Wessi habe ich meist leichte Probleme mit den...na ja sagen wir mal etwas gewollt tiefsinnigen Texten der Bands aus der früheren DDR. Nicht dass die Texte der im Westen gängigen Bands unbedingt besser waren, aber sie waren meist auf englisch und daher nur teilweise verständlich. Bei ""Lift"" und hier insbesondere bei dem Album ""Meeresfahrt"" ist aber die Musik von einer solch hohen Qualität, dass die Texte ohnehin kaum ins Gewicht fallen. Wer daher auf progressive Rockmusik mit starkem Akkustikanteil wie ""Anyones daughter"" oder ""Novalis"" steht, wird auch an ""Lift"" durchaus Gefallen finden."
5,"Hammer das Teil...Ich Persöhnlich finde sie besser als die 93-95(wobei auch die 93-96 fette Tracks zu bieten hatte)...cd2 bevorzuge ich zwar ein weng mehr aber finde das die Erste auch net zu wünschen übrig lässt nur am Anfang 6 lieder drauf sind die mir net so gefallen haben 1,5,6 und 7 aber das ist Geschmackssache daher kein Einfluss auf meine Bewertung. Kann sie nur empfehlen KAUFEN KAUFEN KAUFEN!!!!! '''''TUNNEL4EVER'''''"
1,"Ich hab mir die Gigi Alben vielleicht in der falschen Reihenfolge gekauft ( zuerst die aktuellen Alben, danach das ""alte TecnoFes1"""
5,"Die neueste Single ""Das erste Mal tat's noch weh"" ist eine wunderschöne Single à la Oli P.Wirklich sehr sehr gut,vergleichbar mit ""Flugzeuge im Bauch"". Also, nicht nur für Oli P. Fans ein Kauf wert!!! TOP!!!"
5,"Mir persönlich gefällt die Platin Edition des Megasellers  Nena feat. Nena besser als die erste Auflage. Zum einen ist ""Carpe diem"" nicht mit drauf. Was für ein Glück, das Stück mochte ich nie besonders. Ersetzt wurde es vom vorzüglichen ""Wunder geschehen"" in der ""Nena and Friends"" Version. Zum Zweiten gefällt mir das blaue Cover wesentlich besser als das Rote."
1,"Na da hat man uns mal wieder ein Casting Ei geschenkt. Bereits bum zusehen der Popstars Sendungen wurde mir teils übel. Ich fand es diesmal nur nervig, künstlich und total in die Länge gezogen. Dazu kam, wenn man die Kanditaten zb. mit Stefan Raabs Suche nach guten Stimmen vergleicht, total abstinken. Kein einziger Kandidat hat ein richtig herausragende Stimme. Bei Monrose ist das immerhin noch Mandy. Monrose bekommen auch gute Kompositionen aufgelegt, die Spaß machen. Haunted klingt wie JUstin Timberlake für arme. Die Wahl des Bandnamens grenzte schon an einen Witz. Zu offensichtlich die Anlehnung an Room 483, das Album von Tokio Hotel.  Fazit: Haunted ist langweilig, teils sogar nervend plus: Es gibt kein einziges Bandmitglied, dass man sich aufgrund toller stimmlicher Fähigkeiten merken wird.  Abstürzfaktor aller Preluders, Overground und co.... Schönen Dank auch"
2,"Ich möchste die Band wirklich nicht schlecht machen, aber 'Haunted' ist mit Abstand die schwächste erste Single einer Popstars-Band, die ich kenne. Beispielsweise dieses Geheule am Anfang ... schrecklich; auch der Chorus geht null ins Ohr. Der einzige Lichblick, meines Erachtens ist Tjalda. Viel Erfolg, man darf gespannt sein."
1,"Der Name des Songs ist leider Programm. Im Vergleich zu den sonstigen talentfreien Castingsternchen schaffen es die Mädels ja sogar halbwegs ordentlich einen Ton zu treffen, aber zu viel mehr reicht es bei Ihnen dann leider auch wieder nicht. Ein extrem schwacher Song, von drei konturlosen Interpretinnen, wer braucht so etwas ?"
5,"Also ganz zu Anfang: Ich bin kein Sarah Connar Fan und auch kein Fann von Balladen, doch diese Single ist wirklich super Produziert und auf der Single ist auch eine R&amp;B Nummer ""Change"" drauf die auch sehr gut ist!! Bin mir ziemlich sicher dass dieser Song bald die neue Nummer 1 in den deutschen Verkaufscharts werden wird!! Also auf jedenfall einen Kauf wert^^"
2,"Sarah Connor war vor einigen Jahren wirklich gut, coole Musik aus Deutschland. Seit sie allerdings so extrem auf dieser Balladen-Welle reitet, finde ich sie nur noch langweilig. Habe das sichere Gefühl diesen Song schon zum 1000mal von ihr gehört zu haben. Sarah sollte sich neue Songschreiber suchen, die ihr entweder einen neuen Balladen-Stil verpassen oder ihr mal wieder etwas mehr  RnB und Pop einflößen. Gute Stimme, extrem schwacher Song, ergeben magere 2-Sterne!!!"
2,"Die CD ist schlichtweg enttäuschend. Man findet (außer 'Love Don't Cost A Thing') weder Ohrwürmer noch eingängige Balladen. Die Arrangements erwecken allesamt den Eindruck, auf die Schnelle zusammengeschustert worden zu sein. Wenn einem wenigstens noch Jennifers tolle Stimme über dieses Manko hinweghelfen würde... Aber nein! Ein paar schwache Tonleitern à l Mariah Carey - jedoch lange nicht mit einer so starken, mitreißenden Stimme. Schade Jennifer! Ich drücke dennoch zwei Augen zu... und gebe dir den ersten Stern fürs wirklich gelungene CD-Layout und Dein gutes Aussehen *g*, den zweiten Stern für das einzige gute Lied auf Deiner CD: 'Love Don't Cost A Thing'! Zeige uns bitte bei Deiner nächsten CD (wenn es denn noch eine gibt!), daß Du das Singen nicht verlernt hast..."
1,"Alle Leute, die die Songs im Original kennen, werden wohl anfangen zu heulen, wenn sie hören, was die Preluders daraus gemacht haben! Zwar sind die Songs aus den 50ern und 60ern, dennoch kenn ich den ein oder andren Song! Zum Mitsingen mag die CD zwar ganz okay sein, künsterlich ist sie allerdings unterste Schublade! Wer auch immer den Preluders gesagt hat, sie sollen eine CD mit Coversongs machen, gehört hinter Gittern! Es ist sowieso schon schwer, als Castingband ernst genommen zu werden und mit dieser CD voll mit Coversong schießen sich die Preluders selbst ins Aus! Sie hätten lieber mal ein paar Songs selbst schreiben sollen, vielleicht würde man sie dann als eigenständige Band aktzeptieren! Für alle, die die Preluders mögen, wird das natürlich die beste CD 2004 sein, für alle andren ist es wieder ein unnötiger Silberling einer Castingband..."
4,"Wie begeistert war ich damals (und bin es heute noch) von Britney Spears' Album ""In the Zone"", das vor Vielfalt so strotzte. Elekro-Pop-Tracks mit Ohrwurmfaktor treffen auf schöne, radiotaugliche Balladen ohne großartig Effekte besitzen zu müssen. Genau das war bei Britney Spears in der Vergangenheit die perfekte Mischung aus totaler Aufgedrehtheit und gefühlvoller Schlichtheit. Deshalb war ich so erstaunt, keine einzige waschechte Ballade auf ""Blackout"" zu finden. Selbst das ruhige Abschlusslied ""Why Should I Be Sad"" kommt nicht ohne Beats aus. Gegen die ganzen Up-Tempo-Nummern habe ich ja nichts, sie sind im Wesentlichen sehr gut anzuhören. Hit-Garant Nate Hills, der unter Anderem auch für Nelly Furtados Überalbum ""Loose"" zuständig war, sorgt für ein ausgewogenes, solides Klangbett mit Beats, das Ohrwurmqualität aufweist. Eine besondere Perle auf dem Album ist sicherlich die zweite Singleauskopplung ""Piece of Me"", bei dem Britney auf ihre früheren Abstürze eingeht und dabei die Presse verhöhnt. ""Hot as Ice"", produziert von US-Rapper T-Pain, bleibt durch den geraden Gesangstil und dem eingängigen Refrain im Kopf hängen. Schlechte Songs gibt es auf ""Blackout"" nur geringfügig, einzig und allein das nervenaufreibend furchtbare Chaosstück ""Freakshow"" liegt schwer im Gehörgang und steht allein als Totalausfall auf dem Album. Mit ""Heaven on Earth"" reist man sogar mit wohlbekannten und typischen Synthies zurück in die 80er. Doch die schönen Balladen ohne Schnickschnack aus der Vergangenheit (z.B. ""Everytime"" oder ""Shadow"") vermisst man. Dabei kann Britney so gut Liebeslieder singen, ohne auf Beats zurückgreifen zu müssen, damit es funzt. Das enttäuscht mich ein bisschen und deswegen bin ich nicht gewillt, ""Blackout"" volle fünf Sterne zu vergeben. Zum Abtanzen oder selbst als Beschallung während des Badputzens ist dieses Album aber durchaus geeignet. Ich hoffe aber wieder mehr von den ruhigen Britney-Nummern auf ihrem demnächst in den Handel kommendem Werk ""Circus"" zu hören."
1,"die songs, die ok bis gut waren sind schon als singles verbraten. der rest ist höchstens mittelmaß. nicht zu vergleichen mit den alten alben :-/ ich habe leider keinen potentiellen kracher mehr entdecken können. vielleicht wirds nächste album wieder besser(hoffentlich :-)"
2,"Ich habe alle Popstarsstaffeln gesehen, bis auf diese und ich scheine nicht wirklich was verpasst zu haben. Nun halte ich das Album in den Händen und finde, dass 5 der 13 Titel unter die Top Ten kommen könnten. Aber mehr hat dieser Longplayer wirklich nicht zu bieten.  Ich habe lediglich ein Teil des Finales gesehen, gerade als Patricia ""i can t stop feeling"" sang. Schöner Song, klasse Stimme!!  Dann kam Antonella. Der Gesang ist höchstens für die Dusche gut, aber nicht für mehr.... Hier die fünf durchaus hörbaren Titel: (alles andere, ab in die Tonne)! 1. No Smoke 2. Bike 3. Over it 4. Sprung 5. I can t stop feeling Bitte nicht kaufen, spart euch das Geld!!!"
5,"Als ich die Soundfiles zur Vorabprobe gehört habe, war ich ehrlich gesagt enttäuscht und erwartete nur ein mittelmäßiges Album. Mit solch niedrigen Erwartungen hat mich bei 'Who's Got The Last Laugh Now?' der Schlag getroffen. Das Album ist fantastisch geworden, die aktuelle Single ""Hello!"" würde ich sogar noch als eines der schwächsten Stücke ansehen. Nach dem (ebenfalls sehr guten) Intro geht es mit ""Hello!"" los, gleich darauf folgt ""Privileged To Witness"", das vom Stil her an ""weekend!"" erinnert, im Gegensatz zu ""Hello!"" aber keinesfalls älteren ähnelt oder gar gleicht. ""Rock Bottom"" ist ganz klar von ""Maria"" inspiriert, die Melodie ist aber noch viel schöner und wie im Übrigen auch der Rest des Albums viel ""detaillierter"". Man merkt wirklich, dass in diesem Album Arbeit steckt. Es folgt das meiner Meinung nach zusammen mit ""Hello!"" schwächste Lied, ""The Leading Horse"". Dieses ist zwar wiederum schön anzuhören, passt aber nicht so ganz zum Rest des Albums, der insgesamt schnell und ""treibend"" ist, anders kann man es nicht sagen. Man kann beim Hören kaum ruhig sitzen, so toll sind die Tracks teilweise. ""Take Me Baby"" ist so einer. Zwar etwas ruhiger, aber mit einem genialen Hintergundbeat, der mich beim Hören durchgehend zappeln lässt. ""Apache"" ist zusammen mit ""Unity Without Words Pt. 3"" und ""Mesmerized"" einer der drei Instrumental-Tracks. ""Apache"" ist ein knackiger Clubtrack mit Westernmelodien, der zwischendurch sehr erfrischend ist, weil es mal was ganz Anderes ist. ""UWW Pt.3"" ein sehr ruhiges Trancelied, ""Mesmerized"" ist ein wenig schneller. Positiv ist hier zu erwähnen, dass sie im Gegensatz zu ""Trance-Atlantic"" von ""Mind The Gap"" nicht zu ruhig ausgefallen sind, sondern sehr gelungen, sodass sie auch von einer aktuellen ""Future Trance"" sein könnten. Bleiben noch ""Everlasting Love"" sowie ""Seven Brigdes"". Letzteres gefällt mir erstaunlich gut, auch wenn mir die Melodie von ""Über Sieben Brücken Musst Du Gehen"" gar nicht gefällt. Es ist von mittlerer Schnelligkeit, aber einer der unauffälligsten Tracks. Und zu guter Letzt ""Everlasting Love"". Auch ich als Scooter-Fan dachte mir, 'Das darf doch nicht wahr sein', als ich das laß. Aber die Genialität, mit der Scooter dieses Lied gecovert hat, hat mich umgehauen. Es ist das schnellste Stück des Albums und vom alten Lied ist bis auf den Refrain nichts mehr übrig geblieben, stattdessen wurde ein absolut Happy Hardcore-Kracher daraus gemacht, der vom Refrain extrem profitiert."
2,"Die 2 Sterne gibt es nur wegen dem Cover Artwork und der Produktion. Man merkt sofort, dass der alte Sänger Jimmy Ryan den Haste the Day Sound ausgemacht hat. Wer eine Steigerung von Burning Bridges oder When everything falls sucht ist hier defintiv falsch. Also einfach irgendeine x-beliebige 0815 Metalcore CD aus dem Regal ziehen, hier kann man sich das Geld sparen."
1,"Sag mal, checkt ihr das nicht!? DAS IST KEIN THRASH METAL! Das ist billiger gehypter Kommerz POP-Rock. Die Kinder können einpacken gegen  wahre Metal Bands."
2,"Body Count in 2006? Ja, unglaublich. Eigentlich dachte ich, die Band hätte sich schon längst aufgelöst, aber plötzlich ist dieses Album aufgetaucht. Nun, dieser Release kann getrost ausgelassen werden. Body Count funktioniert 2006 einfach nicht mehr. Das komplette Album hört sich komplett überholt an. Es ist wie eine Reise zurück in die 90er Jahre.  Zugegeben, einige Tracks rocken immer noch ganz schön (z.B. ""The Passion of Christ""), aber insgesamt reicht das einfach bei weitem nicht, um daraus ein komplettes gutes Album zu machen. Body Count liefert fast 10 Jahre später absolut nichts Neues ab. Ice-T hat immer noch Klasse und hat für die Musikszene sehr viel getan. Aber was Body Count angeht, hätte er der Band mit ""Violent Demise"" 1997 ein Ende setzen sollen, wobei auch dieses Album schon weitaus schwächer war als die guten ersten beiden Alben der Band.  Mal sehen, was uns noch erwartet."
1,"es kling bisschen hart aber es ist die Wahrheit! der Titel soll heissen ""Talentfreie werden gesucht"" nicht deutschland sucht den superstar! was werden unsere nachbarländern dazu sagen? ist das die Zukünft der kreativen Musik????"
1,"Schade, als Sandrafan habe ich mich sehr auf dieses neue Album gefreut, zumal mir das letzte, trotz Stilwechsel, gut gefallen hat. Hätte ich es doch mal angehört, bevor ich ich es gekauft habe! Passend zur letzten Enigmascheibe besteht das Album nur aus dünnem Einheitsbrei. Mit einer einzigen Ausnahme (Casino Royal) plätschern die Songs lahm dahin. Die poppige, energiereiche Sandra scheint in eine Art Halbschlaf verfallen zu sein. Da nutzt auch der Chor der Schlümpfe (der wohl ein Kinderchor sein soll) nix. Einfach traurig, die Scheibe verkauft sich nur wegen des Namens."
1,"Flache Texte und flache Melodien. Das sind wir von den Stereophonics zum Glück nicht gewohnt. Wer ein Fan der Band ist, tue sich selbst einen Gefallen und lasse die Finger von dieser CD.  Kelly Jones singt scheinbar ohne Lust und Emotion. Eine Qual für die Ohren, trotz seiner genialen Stimme.  Die einzigen guten Songs sind Jayne und Summer. Der Rest ist was für die Tonne.  Schade eigentlich, hatte mich sehr auf das Album gefreut."
2,"Nach großen Erwartungen aufgrund der tollen Kritiken , bin ich doch etwas enttäuscht. Irgendwie tut sich auf der Scheibe nix. Schade, hoffentlich haut er live etwas mehr drauf !"
5,"Also was die Herren aus Leipzig da abgeliefert haben ist ja ein Hammer-Teil geworden! Daß es etwas völlig anderes werden würde, hat sich ja schon im Vorfeld abgezeichnet und bei mir nicht gerade für Wohlbehagen gesorgt. Allerdings haben die ersten Töne von ""The Black Sea"" aus einem der Trailer der Band-Homepage schon so hypnotisierend gewirkt, daß sich das Gefühl schnell in Neugier verwadelte. Und dann konnte ich den Track und sein Gefolge endlich in voller Länge hören. Wahnsinn! Dieses Album ist nicht jedermanns Sache, was sich in hitzigen Diskussionen in meinem Freundeskreis deutlich macht. Aber wenn man sich die Ruhe nimmt, sich mit der Unruhe dieser Scheibe zu beschäftigen wird schnell klar, daß es selten ein Album gab, bei dem alles in sich so stimmig ist wie bei diesem. Auch wenn ich selber der Meinung bin, daß das Voice-Filtering mit Distortion mittlerweile jeder Band verboten gehört (ich hoffe Steven Wilson liest das nicht...), sollte man Disillusion noch einmal die Ausnahme gönnen, da es bei Tracks wie ""Don't Go Any Further"" oder dem Titelsong einfach passt und für wunderbare Kontraste sorgt, von denen es auf dieser Platte nur so wimmelt. Was gibt es instrumental zu erwähnen? Also gitarrenmäßig gibt es eine Fülle von Sounds zu hören. Produktionstechnisch kommt die Platte eh einiges klarer rüber, als der zeitweilig etwas dumpfe Vorgänger. Aber jedes Riff klingt vom Grundsound her anders. Während die beiden oben erwähnten Songs mit eher Industrial-mäßigen Wänden daher kommen, erinnert mich Avalanche an Anfang 90er Black-Metal Epen aus Norwegen. Diese Eindrücke bleiben aber nie lange bestehen, da sich die Songs im Halbminuten-Takt weiterentwickeln und dann ist auch schon wieder alles vorbei. Viele Gitarren-Verfremdungen und Keyboard-Sounds sorgen für einen sehr modernen Gesamt-Eindruck. Am Anfang war ich etwas entäuscht,daß Chöre, Streicher und Bläser ebenfalls synthetisch sind. Allerdings hätte alles andere dieses Album zu fett und überlaufen gemacht und die Tatsache, daß es Samples sind, passt in das Gesamt-Konzept.  Eine geniale Spielerei sind die Wassertropfen bei ""Untiefen"", die eine kleine Melodie zu spielen scheinen. Also liebe Leute, wagt Euch doch bitte einmal an diese Platte ran. Diese Band ist so wichtig für progressiv ausgerichtete Musikliebhaber! Es lohnt sich. Ich hoffe diese Band dieses Jahr noch live sehen zu können, da ich sehr gespannt auf die Bühnen-Umsetzung dieses Super-Bolzens bin."
2,"In so mancher Rezension über ""Return to Childhood"" wird behauptet, Fish sei noch immer so gut bei Stimme wie vor 20 Jahren, als Marillion mit ""Misplaced Childhood"" ihre größten Erfolge feierten. Das ist leider nicht im Mindesten wahr. Tatsächlich werden die gesanglichen Fähigkeiten von Fish seit über 10 Jahren zunehmend schlechter, was nicht nur die Live-Alben des Künsters belegen, sondern sich mittleriweile sogar aus den Studioaufnahmen heraushören lässt. ""Return to Childhood"" gibt hier nur ein weiteres, bedrückendes Beispiel dafür ab. Fishs Stimme klingt erschöpft und völlig heiser und er erreicht keine hohen Stimmlagen mehr. Dementsprechend wird auf der aktuellen Live-CD z.B. Kayleigh, der größte Marillion-Hit,  in einer deutlich niedrigeren Tonlage gespielt, damit Fish den Song einigermaßen singen kann. Darüber hinaus singt eine Backgroundsängerin einen großen Teil der Songs zur Unterstützung mit.  Es ist darum um so bedauerlicher, dass so manche Marillion-Fans der ersten stunde dem Nachfolger von Fish bei Marillion, Steve Hogarth, nie eine Chance gegeben haben, denn der ist noch heute ein herausragender Sänger, ganz davon abgesehen, dass Marillion noch heute musikalisch relevante großartige Alben produzieren, was man von Fishs Soloalben meistens nicht behaupten kann.  So bliebt denn auch ein fader Beigeschmack, dass sich Fish nun durch die 20jährige Jubiläumstour zu Misplaced Childhood auf die erfolgreiche Vergangenheit beziehen muss, um mehr Aufmerksamkeit zu erzielen. Dabei lässt ""Return to Childhood"" musikalisch nicht viel zu wünschen übrig. Der Sound ist sehr gut und die Begleitband ist hervorragend. Der Einsatz von zwei Gitarristen zahlt sich positiv aus und verleiht vielen der alten Songs, die ja nur für eine Gitarre bestimmt waren, ein paar neue Facette.  Über die Songauswahl der ersten CD, die Songs aus Fish Solojahren präsentiert, kann man streiten, man hätte sich vielleicht ein paar andere Songs gewünscht.  Es bleibt aber die Enttäuschung über die gesangliche Leistung von Fish. Wenn man sich anhört, wie das 1988 auf der Live-CD ""The Thieving Magpie"" klang, auf der Misplaced Childhood ebenfalls komplett enthalten ist, kann man über ""Return to Childhood"" wahrlich nicht begeistert sein."
2,"...unsäglich schleppend und nervtötend, dieses Album. Nein, es klingt einfach nicht mehr frisch, so zu klingen. Es ist langweilig, es ist Musik von alten Männern für... ja, für wen eigentlich? Ich kann mir nicht vorstellen, dass irgend jemand, der die alten Werke sein Eigen nennt, diese Scheibe jemals hören wollte. Einfach aus dem Grund, dass davon nichts hervorsticht. Es wirkt, als hätte man die Reste der Sessions der alten Alben eben mal kurz zwischen Tür und Angel neu aufgenommen. Und das ist nun wirklich kein Lob für eine der besten Bands der 80er Jahre. Mein Fazit: ein Album, das man sich sparen kann. Und nur deshalb zwei Sterne, weil es eben doch eine Kultband ist und immerhin noch besser, als keine Musik."
5,"Ich dachte von ""Mitten ins Herz"" schon, dass dieses geniale Album kaum zu toppen sei. Doch Frei.Wild haben die erwartungen um weiten übertroffen. Ein absolutes Meisterwerk und ein Must-Have für jeden Freund von gepflegtem und klugem Deutschrock. Wenn die Entwicklung der Band weiterhin so steil nach oben geht, haben die Jungs ne riesen Karriere vor sich.  Ich freue mich total auf die diesjährigen Festivals, denn Live sind die Jungs ebenfalls ne Wucht! MfG Staigi"
4,"Endlich kommt mal wieder Abwechslung in die eintönige Welt des Musikbuisness! Nelly Furtado, eine wunderschöne Stimme kombiniert mit einem vielseitigen und effektvollen Sound! Eigentlich alles perfekt, aber (das berühmte ""aber"")...einige Stellen in wenigen Liedern sind zu übertrieben und drücken die schönen Stelle rapide nach unten. Trotzdem wirklich hörenswert!!! Passend zum Frühling!"
4,"Sie haben sich selbst ja immer irgendwie als einzig legitime Nachfolger der Beatles gesehen, was, wenn man alle so genannten Britpop-Bands vergleicht, zumindest soundmäßig nicht unbedingt von der Hand zu weisen ist. Ob sie als Songschreiber die Genialität von Lennon/McCartney auch nur annähernd erreichen, sei dahingestellt! Rein vom Songwriting her ist ""Lyla"" durchaus gelungen, abgesehen von der Tatsache, dass eigentlich nichts wirklich Aufregendes passiert - und das immerhin fünf Minuten lang. Und auf einen Mittelteil, die so genannte ""Bridge"", wartet der Hörer auch vergeblich. Das schlimmste allerdings ist die absolut schlampige Produktion - rumpelnde Bässe, schwache Höhen, wenig Dynamik. Gewollt oder nicht, so muss 2005 keine Band klingen, auch wenn sie sich an Vorbildern aus den 60ern orientiert. Zumal eben die schon vor 40 Jahren mit bescheideneren Mitteln einen besseren Sound produzierten. Vielleicht wollte man bei ""Lyla"" zur Abwechslung aber mal ein wenig nach Rolling Stones klingen - die Gesangsmelodie hat zumindest deutliche Ähnlichkeit mit ""Street Fighting Man"", und auch die Pianofigur am Ende haben wir genau dort auch schon mal gehört. Die Tatsache, dass in Ermangelung eines eigenen Schlagzeugers mit Zak Starkey der Sohn des Beatles-Drummers Ringo Starr an der Schießbude sitzt, passt ganz nebenbei hervorragend ins Gesamtbild, das durch die beiden Non-Album-Tracks abgerundet wird. ""Eyeball Tickler"" ist eine nette Dreiminuten-Nummer ohne besonderen Tiefgang, aber dafür scheint über ""Won't Let You Down"" der Geist von John Lennon zu schweben. Musikalisch eine Mixtur aus ""Dear Prudence"" vom Weißen Album und ""Give Peace A Chance"" (man achte auf die Bassdrum und die Handclaps ab 1:10""). Wenn diese Kostprobe nur ein annähernd repräsentativer Vorgeschmack auf den Longplayer ist, dann erwartet uns ein interessantes Suchspiel nach dem Motto: Gallagher und Co. waren auf Beutetzug durch die Musikgeschichte und der Hörer geht auf Entdeckungsreise. Weil das bereits auf der vorliegenden Maxi-CD eine durchweg spaßige und interessante Sache ist, gäbe es normalerweise die volle Punktzahl - wenn da nicht diese schlampige Produktion wäre."
2,"Jetzt weiß ich, wo uns der Trend hinführt: Zu Harmoniefolgen, die jeder Amateur auf die Beine kriegt, zu einer Orchestration, die einen die Schuhe auszieht. Es mag wirklich sein, dass die Musik die Geschmäcker anspricht, aber würden Sie diese Musik mit Soundtracks vergleichen, die schon Jahrzehnte zurückliegen, ist das hier ein Witz. Dazu kommt, dass Nicholas Hooper ein Kammerorchester vorzieht. Zu einem Film wie Harry Potter erwarte ich aber etwas Besseres: Bläser sollen zum Einsatz kommen, wie es die hervorragenden Vorgänger John Williams und Patrick Doyle getan haben.  Natürlich ist nicht alles schlecht an diesem Soundtrack. Hooper versteht es zumindest, die richtige Stimmung des Filmes zu treffen. Die Musik trifft sie genau, wobei man hier auch kritisieren muss, dass die Musik an manchen Stellen vor sich hin ""brabbeld"" und keinen Sinn ergibt. Wo ist die alte Musik von John Williams geblieben, der super Harmoniefolgen, super Orchester und perfekte Orechestrierungen im Gepäck hat??? Eine Rückkehr von ihm oder von Patrick Doyle würde ich begrüßen. Tatsache begeistert dieser Soundtrack die meisten Hörer. Warum? Weil die Masse auf Einfaches steht. Nimmt man zum Beispiel das Thema von Umbrige unter die Lupe, so erkennt man: Ton abwärts, abwärts, abwärts, und was sage ich dazu: Mist, Mist, Mist.... Und das soll Musik zu einem Blockbusterfilm sein? Anscheinend. Generell geht es abwärts mit der Filmmusik: Zu einfach sind die Melodien, außerdem bringen die meisten Komponisten an dramatischen und grusiligen Stellen kein vernünftigen Ton zum Vorschein, das Orchester lässt auch zu wünschen übrig. Wer also auf wirklich Gutes abfährt sollte zu John Williams, Alan Menken oder Frank Churchill greifen. Das ist hohe Qualitätsarbeit. Hier merkt man das Können. Was an diesem Soundtrack aber dennoch gefällt, ist die wirklich passende Melodie, sie ist seehr einfach gestrickt, aber sie passt, und klingt einigermaßen auch gut. Das ewige Gerede Hooper verwende hier ""hohe Kunst"" ist absoluter Blödsinn. John Williams, bitte komme für den siebenten Teil zurück!!! Abschließend kann ich sagen, dass der Soundtrack auf dem selben Niveau steht, wie die Musik von Hans Zimmer.  Schade!!!"
5,"Dies ist das 1995 erschienene, erste Album der Bremer Stadtmusikanten ""Mr. President"" gewesen.  Nachdem ich zuvor schon von den Singles ""Up N Away"" und ""I ll Follow The Sun"" begeistert war, musste ich es mir einfach kaufen und wurde nicht enttäuscht. Das Album beginnt mit einem kurzen ""Intro"", auf welches das bekannte ""Up N Away"" folgt, auf dem noch Lazys Vorgänger Sir Prophet statt ihm rappt.  Danach kommt ""4 On The Floor"" - leider ohne den Rap, den ich so klasse finde.  Als vierter Track auf der CD befindet sich ""On My Mind"", ein Song mit mehreren Raps und einem schnellen Dance-Beat, der mich beim Hören immer an einen entlegenen Wald im Sommer erinnert (keine Ahnung, warum ;-)).  Danach folgt das etwas düster klingende ""I Believe"", auf welchem erst T 2 Strophen singt und dann Lazy den Rap flüstert. Dieser Song ist, obwohl er für MPs Verhältnisse düster klingt, ein Highlight der CD. Lied Nr. 6 ist der langsame Reggae-Song ""Close To You"", der durch die locker-leichte, von Trommeln begleitete Musik und Daniis weiche Stimme den perfekten Kontrast zum vorherigen ""I Believe"" bildet. Das Lied wird mit Ausnahme von Lazys Rap ausschließlich von Danii gesungen und handelt von einer zerbrochenen Liebe, die Danii wieder aufleben lassen will, Lazy jedoch nicht, weil er sich ausgenutzt fühlt. Von der Musik her ist ""Close To You"" im Stil von ""Happy People"". Dieser Song ist auch heute noch einer meiner Lieblingssongs!  Auf ""Close To You"" folgt ""Never Leave Me"", auf welchem Lazy erst zwei Strophen singt und dann, während die Musik schneller und basslastiger wird, einen harten, schnellen Rap hinlegt. Dieser Song ist ein Partytrack und sprüht nur so vor Power und Sexyness! Der nächste Song ist das bekannte ""I ll Follow The Sun"", welches mich heute noch genauso begeistert wie damals; die Melodie ist einfach der Hammer! Lied Nr. 9 ist das locker-leichte ""Easy Come, Easy Go"", auf dem Lazy in mehreren Raps die Geschichte eines Tages erzählt, an dem eigentlich alles schief gelaufen ist, vom Hund, der das Frühstück gefressen hat, bis zum Abend im Restaurant, wo seine Begleiterin gegangen ist, weil er das Portemonnaie vergessen hat. Ein fröhlich-beschwingter Song, bei dem man spätestens beim ersten Chorus anfängt, mit den Füssen zu wippen. Dazu im Kontrast steht wieder der nächste Song ""Sweet Lies"", eine traurige, ausschließlich von Lazy gesungene Soulballade, die von einer Beziehung handelt, die kapputt ging, weil die Frau ständig gelogen hat. So traurig, wie der Song ist, so schön ist er auch, so dass es nicht verwundert, dass er für mich bis heute noch zu den schönsten Balladen gehört, die ich kenne. Es folgt ""Close To Your Heart"", auf welchem Lazy singt und im Refrain von T und Danii begleitet wird. ""Close To Your Heart"" ist recht schwer zu beschreiben; es ist kein langsamer Song, aber für Leute, die nur die MP-Singles kennen, doch recht langsam. Das Lied handelt von einer zerbrochenen Beziehung, klingt aber nicht traurig. Die Melodie geht sofort ins Ohr und der Text verleitet zum Mitsingen. Danach kommt das schnelle ""Gonna Get Along (Without Ya Now)"" in der raplosen Version. Es wird durchgehend von T gesungen und ist für mich bis heute der schlechteste Song auf dem Album. Nicht dass das Lied schlecht wäre - es ist für das, was es so auf dem Musikmarkt gibt, überdurchschnittlich - aber die anderen Songs auf ""Up N Away - The Album"" finde ich einfach besser. Der nächste Song ist der Dance-Song ""I Would Die For You"", welcher durch das Abwechseln von Refrains und mehereren Raps klingt wie eine Unterhaltung zwischen Danii und Lazy. Am Ende der Raps fragt Lazy immer ""What would you do for me?"" und Danii singt dann ""I would die for you, I would die for you. All you gotta do..."" Ein Song, der gute Laune macht! Danach folgt die größte Überraschung des Albums für mich: ""Keep It Up"". ""Keep It Up"" ist ein schneller Song mit 2 harten, zungenbrecherisch-schnellen Raps von Lazy, einem unheimlich powervollen Refrain, bei dem T und Lazy sich abwechseln und einer ""weichen"" Bridge am Ende des Songs. Das mag typisch für MP klingen, aber der Song ist wirklich eine Klasse für sich! Ich hätte mir gewünscht, dass MP damals statt ""Gonna Get Along"" ""Keep It Up"" veröffentlicht hätten, weil dieser Song das ganze Potential von MP zeigt. ""Keep It Up"" geht übergangslos in das ""Outro"" über, bei dem wie beim ""Intro"" eine dunkle, mystische Stimme aus dem Off redet und man dann etwas hört, was klingt wie Pferdegetrampel auf einer Brücke. Das ""Outro"" schließt das eigentliche Album ab. Lied Nr. 16 ist eine ca. 5-minütige House-Version von ""Up N Away"", die jedoch bei Weitem nicht an das Original herankommt. Alles in allem kann ich das hier von mir rezensierte Album nur wärmstens empfehlen, da es zeitlos ist und die ganze Bandbreite von MPs Können zeigt."
5,"Kaum ein anderes Killing Joke-Album ist (auch zum Zeitpunkt seiner Veröffentlichung) so unterbewertet worden wie dieses. Killing Joke präsentieren zwar stärker mainstream-orientertes Material als auf ihren ersten Platten, was damals nicht jedem Fan gefiel, bieten aber dafür ein Album, daß vor bombastischen Soundcollagen mit durchweg Ohrwurmcharakter nur so strotzt. Die Platte gehört bis heute zu meinen persönlichen Top10. Und das wird sich wohl auch in Zukunft nicht ändern."
5,"NOT SUCH AN INNOCENT GIRL: Sollte wohl der Blockbuster von Victorias Album sein. Na ja, für mich ist es eher einer der schlechteren Songs. Es fehlt das gewisse Etwas."
1,"Vielleicht stellt diese Aufnahme technisch eine Referenz dar. Jedoch vom Ausdruck und vom Inhalt der Motetten ist beim Anhören der Stücke weniger als Null zu ""spüren"". Es wird mathematisch runtergespult, was eben laut Noten dasteht. Homophone Stellen werden mit höchstem Bedacht auf Gleichklang im Chor statisch hingestellt ohne jede Flexibilität oder das Achten auf den Zusammenhang im Text und der Musik. Das Bild des Eisblocks drängt sich auf. Das bewirkt zwar den heute für ""historisierende Aufführungspraxis"" stehenden durchhörbaren Klang, ist aber meiner Meinung nach 100% von dem entfernt, was der Heinrich Schütz mit den Motetten aufgrund seines Glaubens zum Ausdruck brachte. Das Tempo ""steht"" während der Stücke, es erscheinen kaum Veränderungen, die eine musikalische Geste hervorbringen könnten. Die Noten erscheinen wie abgespult, viel zu schnell. Ohne Entspannungen oder sich Zeit lassen um eine neue Phrase zu beginnen, was der Text und Musik erfordern würden. Auch dynamisch gibt es außer an Phrasenschlüssen keine bemerkbaren Unterschiede. Was soll das? Hat jemand der Beteiligten überhaupt die Möglichkeit in Erwägung gezogen, dass der Text ""Unser keiner lebet ihm selber"" am Kranken- und Sterbebett von Magdalena Schütz, seiner einzigen Frau, gebetet wurde? Die absolute Lieblosigkeit, mit der das Stück ""musiziert"" wird, spricht dagegen. Und es gibt auch heute noch Menschen, die mit diesen Stücken ihre tiefsten Glaubenserfahrungen verbinden, die Texte und ihre Umsetzung sind keinesfalls nur ""barocke Glaubensinnigkeit"". Doch wer soll bei dieser Aufnahme nachvollziehen können, was da an teilweise unbegreiflichen Dingen ausgesprochen wird? Wer soll im Affentempo den unendlichen Reichtum an polyphonen Gebilden nachempfinden können?  Die Motetten sind zum ersten und allerwichtigsten Aussagen über den christlichen Glauben und nicht in erster Linie Arbeitsfeld für eine, wie ich meine, völlig überdrehte Darstellung von Chortechnik. Am besten bleibt es, diese unübertreffbare herrliche Musik selber zu singen oder sich in einer Kirche anzuhören. Wo sind wir angekommen? Es ist unbegreiflich, dass diese Aufnahme überall in den höchsten Tönen gelobt wird. Hört überhaupt noch jemand zu oder wird nur bei den CD-Covern auf die Namen und Label geschaut? In allen Rezensionen ist von Klang die Rede, nirgendswo von Geistlicher Chormusik. Zum Glück hat Heinrich Schütz den Titel selber vorgegeben. Doch das Machwerk auf der CD ist keine Musik, noch weniger Geistliche Chormusik, dafür jede Menge Zirkus."
2,"Ich kann mich noch ganz genau erinnern wann ich Downset zum ersten Mal live erleben durfte. Das Datum weiß ich jetzt nicht mehr, aber das war auf dem ersten Crossin' all Over - Festival im Stuttgarter LKA mit Such a Surge, Dog eat Dog und Dubwar. Der Song „Anger"" war die Hymne einer damals sehr angespannten, großen alternativen Musikszene. In den Independent Clubs lief der Song und die Meute ging ab. Auch live konnten Rey und seine Homies stets überzeugen und waren damals die große Hoffnung in Sachen harte, groovige Mucke mit einer Menge Wut im Bauch und Anspruch in den Lyrics. Der Begriff Crossover wurde durch Bands wie Downset entdeckt und geprägt.  Als New Metal bezeichnete man damals noch Progressiven Heavy Metal á la Dream Theater und Jonathan Davis pfiff sich sein erstes Prozac rein. Tja soviel Lorbeeren und musikalischer Kult und dann der vierte Longplayer nach einer jahrelangen Funkstille ... „UNIVERSAL"". Es tut mir echt weh schlecht über diese Jungs zu schreiben, aber was soll ich machen. Mit einem ausgelutschten, groovigen Riff und einem unaufhörlichen ""Fuck your Territory"" beginnt der erste Song „All Crews"". Geduldig ziehe ich mir den zweiten, den dritten, den vierten und den fünften Song rein. Die erste musikalische Überraschung gibt's jedoch leider erst bei Song 6 „The Rush"" der zwar trotzdem klar Downset klingt, aber zumindest einen gesungenen Part beinhaltet. Dann geht's jedoch leider wieder  im Gleichschritt Marsch ... bis zum vorletzten Song „Smiles and Cries"" der richtig fett abrockt und überrascht!  Das reicht jedoch leider nicht zu einem guten Album. Hätte mir einer das Teil ohne Vorkenntnis vorgespielt, hätte ich gedacht, das wäre ein Album der Jungs gewesen, dass vor Jahren herausgekommen ist und an mir vorbeigegangen wäre ... wie dieses!"
2,"Das Intro zum titelgebenden ""Well Well Well"" zeigt schon, wo es langgeht auf diesem Album. Man denkt die ganze Zeit: jetzt kommts gleich! Und dann passiert - nichts. Das Intro verpufft sang- und klanglos, unmotiviert und ideenlos. Und alles in allem kann ich das für das ganze Album attestieren. Okay, der Titelsong ist gut, aber danach wird es erschreckend beliebig. Dutzendware eben. Da bleibt rein gar nichts haften. Und das Erschreckende: Milburn zeigen, dass man sogar noch die Kopie kopieren kann, bis hin zum Akzent. Ich halte ja die Arctic Monkeys schon für eine Band, die viel zu spät an den Start gegangen ist, aber jetzt auch noch Milburn ... Himmel, wann wird sich die Milburn-Lookalike-Band in die Charts schrammeln? Die Industrie nudelt das Genre bald noch konsequenter zu Tode als dereinst die NDW. Ich sag es ungern, aber momentan tut man (endlich mal wieder) gut daran, sich musikalisch besser in Amerika umzutun."
5,"""Quaristice"" nimmt den Faden von ""Amber"" wieder auf - was Autechre sehr gut bekommt. Endlich, endlich macht Autechre wieder so richtig Spaß und kommt nicht so verbissen daher wie z.B. bei ""Gantz Graf"" o.ä. Nach meinem Empfinden ist ""Quaristice"" deshalb auch eine hochexplosiv gute Mischung aus ""Amber"" und ""Tri Repetae"". Weter so!!!"
4,"Im Gegensatz zur ""Bongo Bong"", die viele neue und witzige Klaenge hatte, ist diese Platte eher eine Fortsetzung. Nichts wesentlich Neues, alt Bewaehrtes nochmal in neuer Fassung und Kombination. Dennoch ist es eine interessante Scheibe und es macht Spass, reinzuhoeren. Ihr fehlt aber das Zeug zu ""fuenf Sternen"", auch wenn man diese Scheibe losgeloest von der vorherigen ""Bongo Bong"" hoert."
4,"Ich hab das Album mit original Unterschrift vom Herrn Doktor persönlich!  Damit wollte ich nur mal eben angeben.... Denn ich hab ihn glücklicherweise auch schon live erleben dürfen. Vorher kannte ich ihn kaum, aber meine Eltern waren begeistert von ihm und haben mir angeboten mitzufahren. Naja, und da hab ich natürlich nicht nein gesagt und seit dem Auftritt bin ich Ringsgwandl-Fan.  Als ich dann das neu erworbene Album zum ersten Mal hörte war ich zuerst mal ein bißchen enttäuscht, weil nur Songs drauf sind. Denn das Beste an seinem Auftritt waren die Comedy-Nummern zwischen den Songs. Aber auch die sind lohnenswert, jedenfalls zum größten Teil. LAFFA und natürlich der GARTEN-NAZI sind meine Favoriten auf der CD, sie sind die bissigsten und musikalisch die besten. Ich meine, generell sind die Songs musikalisch stark, aber allein wegen der pointenreichen Texte sind die beiden meine Lieblinge. WIA SOIN sollte man vielleicht noch erwähnen, auch sehr gut. Der Rest, das finde ich jedenfalls, at teilweise einfach zu wenig Biss und plätschert zu seicht dahin. Anders, als man es vielleicht von anderen Ringsgwandl-Stücken gewohnt ist. Trotzdem ist GACHE WURZN ein gutes Album, das ich jedem Fan des Herrn Doktor empfehlen kann."
5,"kürzlich kam ich in den genuß eines ringsgwandl-auftritts in wien - ein wirkliches erlebnis, bei dem ua diese cd präsentiert wurde. ringsgwandl und seine fantastische crew besingen menschen aus dem alltag, zb den ""unscheinbaren verkaufsvertreter"" oder den ""schluckspecht"". wir begegnen in einer wundervollen cover-version dem zuletzt bei ""pulp fiction"" eingesetzten mitreißenden ""you never can tell"", das hier ""c'est la vie"" heißt und die lebensweisheit ""es werd scho wern"" transportiert."
4,"Es sind bekannte und weniger bekannte Titel darauf, aber allles mit Schwung. Also keine ""Schnulzen"". Kann man sowohl zum Entspannen, als auch zur Arbeit gut hören."
2,"Nachdem die letzte Tiger Army CD ja schon etwas langsamer und gesetzter war als ihre Vorgänger, findet man auf dieser hier (bis auf wenige Ausnahmen) ziemlich seichtes Material. Richtig, Emocore-AFI-Kajal-Gedudel ist eine Menge dabei, vom Psychobilly ist lediglich ein Slap Bass über (wie von der Tiger Army nur noch Nick13 über ist) und Lieder wie AS THE COLD RAIN FALLS könnten auch von NEW ORDER feat. THE CURE sein. Naja, wie auch immer : Für die seltsame Musikrichtung sind die Songs nicht schlecht. Jedem Psychobilly-Freak   sei geraten : Finger weg. Allenfalls die Dick-Brave-Fraktion, die meint das die fünfziger Jahre nur aus Würfeln, Schwalben, Hello Kitty und Emily Strange  bestanden haben, können mit so einer Musikrichtung was anfangen und denken, das sei Psychobilly. Tiger Army never die? - Irrtum, die sind auf dem besten Wege."
2,"Diese Folge der 3 Fragezeichen ist wirklich wieder eine zum Fremdschämen. Ein DJ ohne Kopf ist ja schon blöd genug, aber neben der dämlichen Grundstory sind auch noch die Dialoge und Sprecher unterirdisch - außer den drei Detektiven natürlich. Diese Folge sollte wohl wieder mal pseudojugendlich gestaltet sein, ist aber nur albern. Leider ist sie aber auch nicht so trashig, dass es lustig ist. Das Ende ist von seltener Dämlichkeit und allgemein finde ich, die Folge hat keine besondere Atmosphäre. Den 2.Stern gibt es nur für die Sprecherleistung von Oliver Rohrbeck und Co."
5,"Ein echt klasse CD! Es war eine meiner ersten Ärzte-CDs und ich muss sagen sie macht süchtig nach mehr. Mittlerweile bin ich großer ärzte-fan. Wer eine CD haben will bei der man lachen kann und nicht alles immer so ernst genommen wird, sollte sich dieses Album auf jeden Fall kaufen. Die CD ist auf jeden Fall auch was für Leute die noch keine Ärztefans sind, denn nach dieser CD sind sie es mit sicherheit."
5,"Dieses Album ist zwar vor über einem halben Jahr erschienen, trotzdem liegt es noch ständig in meinem Player."
5,"Die erste Platte von Crowded House mit dem hervorragenden Hit ""Dont dream its over"" (das Eingangs Gitarren Killer-Riff) offenbart auch nach so langer Zeit das künstlerische Potential der Band. Wie hier die Band zusammenspielt ist einfach traumhaft. Man achte nur auf das  Zusammenspiel von Gitarren, Bass und Drums sowie dem wunderbaren Gesang. Ein Genuß ohne Gleichen für Hörer, die sich Zeit nehmen und für die die Platte stets wächst. Die Stücke sind kompositorisch hervorragend angelegt und gesangs- und harmonietechnisch ein Genuß. Teils sperrig - nie nur Pop sondern sehr einfallsreich arbeitend ist diese Platte ein Klassiker des intelligenten Pop!!!!!!!!!"
5,"Endlich möchte man sagen, endlich besinnt sich Nicole wieder mal darauf, eine Maxi mit Tiefgang zu veröffentlichen."
2,Na klar werden wir alle mal älter aber für mich hat die Loveparade und die dazugehörige Musik eindeutig an Charme verloren. Viel zu komerziell ist das alles geworden. Naja zum Nebenbeihören ganz okay!!!
1,"1. CD/DVD Hüllen zerkratzt, (Papierhülle geknickt) 2. Booklet die ersten 3 seiten in der mitte geknickt ... Ergebnis, scheint gebraucht worden zu sein, ist jedoch als NEU-Ware angeboten worden, daher nur einen stern! Ansonsten Musik wie erwarten TOP!!!!!"
5,"auch dieses jahr ist die mayday eines der angesagtesten Electronic Music events des jahres und das ganze im komlett neuen konzept, die music ist wieder einsame spitze und vielseitig gemischt aus Trance Techno House Acid TechHouse Progressiv Hardtechno usw. für jeden freund der Electronischen Music was dabei. Und dies mal sind es nicht wie sonst 2 CDs sondern 3CDs  von daher sag ich einfach mal  SUPER COMPILATION MAYDAY 2007 &gt;NEW EUPHORIA&lt;"
1,"Von dem neuen Sampler bin ich enttäuscht weil ich mir davon mehr versprochen habe.Tracks die ins Ohr gehen sucht man hier vergeblich.Für mich hatten die Mayday Sampler mal Kultstatus weil sie mit wirklich guten Tracks überraschten.Wo sind die Kracher von Ravers Of Nature,Marusha usw. ??? Wenn dieser Sampler einen aktuellen Überblick über die derzeitige Technoszene geben soll dann hat sich ""Techno"" leider zum Schlechteren entwickelt.Es wird mal wieder Zeit sich auf die guten alten Rave-Zeiten zu konzentrieren dann klappt vielleicht auch mit einer ""New Euphoria"" denn ein Techno-Revival ist mehr als zu begrüssen.Rave On !!!"
5,"Entgegen dem ersten Album, dieses Mal teilweise harte Kost, aber auch erkennbare Strukturen in den songs sowie endlich wieder einmal ein Mike Patton, der Stimmungen wie kein anderer in seinen Stimmlagen wiedergibt. Highlights auf dieser CD sind die langsamen Stücke, die berühren. Wozu wären diese 4 Musiker nur fähig, wenn Sie den kommerziellen Weg einschlagen würden?"
5,"Diese CD besitze ich inzwischen schon etliche Jahre und ich bin jedes Mal wieder fasziniert, wenn ich sie höre. Es ist ein guter Wechsel zwischen hartem Rock und jazzig ruhigen passagen. Meines Erachtens das definitiv beste FNM-Album, an dem ich michauch noch nach Jahren nicht satt hören kann..."
5,"Nigel Kennedys ""Kafka"" lässt sich nur schwer in gängige Musikkategorien einordnen. Die Stücke sind exzentrisch und außergewöhnlich, die Genialität von NK wird hier sofort deutlich. Bei aller Experimentierfreude ist seine Musik nicht zu abgehoben, auch Rock- und Pophörer, die Sinn für neue Ausdrucksmöglichkeiten haben, werden wie ich immer wieder gern diese CD auflegen."
4,"im nunmehr juvenilen 'fono-forum', deutschlands klassik-jazz und hifi-magazin,  puschte ein noch unbedarfter neuer rezensent diese aufnahme der bach-(cembalo-)concerti sogleich in die exzellenz-rubrik.  fray flott interviewt und flott gehört, geht dies ganz leicht, wenn vergleichsweise sehr wenig  vom jungen pianisten vorliegt und alles so musikalisch stimmig swingt.  bach modern, keine strenge, historisierende a-tempo artikulation,  sondern sehr freizügig, flott, aber auch adagio-stimmungsvoll gedehnt.  bach gestalt-ung a la leonhardt perdu!, vom instrument ganz abgesehen. kein zweifel, frays freies spiel ist mitreissend, die bremer kammerspieler voll auf den saiten, die aufnahme klingt wirklich gut. aber es bleibt ein rest unerfüllter einsicht in das grossartig-formale barocke konstrukt, die architektur,  die proportion, die bach erst wirklich (und so schwer) zum klingen bringt."
5,"Wunderbarer Song - verdiente Nummer 1 in Frankreich! Supersüße Sängerin! Hab mir bereits die Single ""Moi...Lolita"" und ihr Album ""Gourmandises"" zugelegt. Super Stimme hat Alizée ein neuer Stern am französischen Pophimmel der hoffentlich noch lange funkelt. Das Video zu Moi...Lolita ist ebenfalls sehr gut gelungen der Song war monatelang mein Lieblingslied ich kann nur sagen Alizée betört!!!!!!!!!!BRAVO"
5,"Dieser Soundtrack von Jocelyn Pook zu dem fesselnden und unterhaltenden Film nimmt den Hörer mit in die Welt Venedigs gegen Ende des 16. Jahrhunderts. Mit abwechslungsreichen Melodien verzaubert diese Musik den Zuhörer und lässt ihn für knapp eine Stunde seinen Alltag vergessen. Die Klangstile dieses Soundtracks lassen sich vorwiegend in der Musik der Renaissance wiederfinden. Jüdisch-orientalische Elemente untermalen das Thema Shylocks und geben damit zum Teil einen etwas leidenden und verzweifelten aber auch nachdenklich stimmenden Ton an. Das Thema Portias ist eine träumende und fast schon weltfremde, meditative Melodie, die passend die Schönheit aber auch die schlichtende Persönlichkeit dieser Figur wiedergibt. Die Gesangsstücke von Andreas Scholl, Hayley Westenra und Ben Crawley sind schlicht schön und geben dem Venedig Shalkespeare's die verliebt, verträumte Note. Hinzu kommen verschiedene muntere Stücke, die ihrerseits wieder den Humor und die Leichtigkeit dieser Komödie musikalisch darstellen. Alles in allem, dieser Soundtrack stellt musikalisch eine Zeitreise in die Renaissance dar, die mit der besonderen Lage Venedigs zwischen christlichem Okzident und (hier) jüdischem Orient zu einem musikalischen Klangerlebnis wird. Viel Spass dabei."
1,"Wie habe ich mich gefreut, wieder ein neues Neil Young Album kaufen zu können! Und wie enttäuscht war ich, nachdem ich es gehört hatte! Es gibt nichts, aber auch wirklich gar nichts, was auf diesem Album musikalisch interesant wäre - keine interessanten Soli, keine Neubearbeitungen alter Stücke, die andere Aspekte zu Tragen brächten, nichts, was einen aufhorchen ließe. Alle Stücke, sowohl live als auch in den Studiofassungen, habe ich schon sauberer und origineller gehört. Nach meiner Meinung ist dieses Album noch überflüssiger als ""Year of the horse""."
4,"aus dem Jahr 1970 oder 1971? Er ist Texaner, Sohn eines Generals, Oxford-Student, Armee-Offizier...später dann Country-Rock-Legende. Country-Hits, die nicht unbedingt der Nashville-Manier entsprachen! Schrieb Nr. 1 Titel für Janis Joblin und Gladys Knight, sang mit allen County-Legenden, und spielte in vielen Filmen glorreiche Rollen, komponierte dafür Melodien ... Ein Multitalent mit Kultstatus. Für Country-Fans ist das Debüt des Baßbaritons ein Muß."
2,"Als ich den Film zum ersten mal gesehen und die Musik gehört haben, war ich schon etwas ergriffen-das hat sich aber schon bald geändert. James Horner ist der wohl am meisten überschätzte Hollywood-Komponist. Im Gegensatz zu beispielsweise Altmeister Jerry Goldsmith, der ständig versucht, neue Klangdimensionen zu erforschen, klaut Horner wo es nur geht. Man kann sagen, daß so ziemlich 90% der Titanic-Musik schon in früheren Horner-Scores vorkamen (Star Trek, Clear and Present Danger, etc.). Selten war ein Oscar so unverdient wie dieser. ""L.A. Confidential"" (Goldsmith) hätte viel eher einen in diesem Jahr verdient gehabt!"
1,"Wer Leann Rimes Weg von Anfang an verfolgt hat wird enttäuscht  von diesem 'Werk' sein. Es ist zu bedauern, dass ein weiteres Talent, wie auch Faith Hill,  dem Mainstream und der Branche zum Opfer gefallen ist. Sie und das ganze Album sind gemacht und dem Markt angepasst worden. Das Künstlerische ist hierbei völlig unter den Tisch gefallen. Leann Rimes ist zu viel Größerem im Stande. Wer das Kommerzielle unterstützen will sollte sich unbedingt dieses Album kaufen."
5,"Diese Traumstimme von Brigitte Fassbaender begeistert mich immer wieder! Sie hat ein warmes Timbre, und in allen Lagen klingt diese Stimme edel, ungekünzelt, beseelt, authentisch in den Gefühlen, unverkennbar und einmalig in ihrer Klangfarbe, so dass sie mich immer wieder verzaubert! Wer Brigitte Fassbaender noch nicht kennt, sollte das schnellstens nachholen! Ich kenne und liebe viele Stimmen, doch ihre ist eine Jahrhundert-Stimme und eine der ganz großen Begabungen! Sehr zu empfehlen!"
5,"Die Übermutter ist in ""Das Haus von Luci"" eingezogen! Dieses Projekt von Luci van Org (Lucilectric, Das Haus von Luci, Plewka&amp;Luci van Org etc.) ist göttlich!  Man kann die Übermutter nehmen wie sie ist, oder als eine von Luci perfekt gespielte Rolle werten, die ein gesamtes Genre persifliert! Musikalisch geht das ganze in Richtung Rammstein, textlich in Richtung Goth-Rock mit Themen wie SM, Religion, Rollenspiel (sexuell, nicht Fantasy). Die Melodien sind extrem eingängig und mitreißend, Jeder Track eine potentielle Single! Im Radio wird man die Übermutter wohl eher selten treffen, da die Hüter der Moral leider meistens der deutschen Sprache mächtig sind... Die Übermutter ist extrem..., extrem humorvoll, extrem talentiert,extrem stimmgewaltig und sie liebt ihre Kinder! Und das steht ihr extrem gut! Ich hoffe auf eine lange Karriere der  neuen Übermutter der Nation!"
4,"Nach zwei Jahren meldet sich Trent Reznor, der Mann hinter Nine Inch Nails, mit einem neuen, dem mittlerweile sechsten Album, zurück. Und alleine schon die Aufmachung erweist sich als düster und geheimnisvoll, färbt sich die CD doch nach der Benutzung schwarz. Ebenfalls zappenduster, aber abwechslungsreich zeigen sich die 16 Tracks. So geht es vom effektgeladenen Intro über Songs, die durch verzerrte Gitarren und bedrohlich geflüstertem Gesang gerade zu bedrohlich wirken, bis hin zu recht tanzkompatiblen Songs und einem verhältnismäßig ruhigen Klavierinstrumental. Die Melodien erweisen sich als sehr komplex und um jede Feinheit der verschachtelten Komposition wahrzunehmen benötigt man mehrere Durchläufe. Auch die Texte sind keine leichte Kost und vervollständigen die Endzeitatmosphäre. So handeln sie alle von der korrumpierten, sozial abgestumpften Welt, wie Trent sie sich in 20 Jahren vorstellt. Wer also auf düstere, elektronische Musik steht, ist mit diesem Longplayer bestens bedient. Aber auch Freunde progressiver Bands wie Tool oder den Deftones können durchaus einen Blick in das Jahr Null riskieren. Den einen Punkt Abzug gibt es anbetracht der Tatsache, dass man aus einigen Tracks hätte mehr herausholen können und mehr als nur einmal ein ""Finale"" in den Songs fehlt, das nicht nur aus elektronischen Soundgewittern besteht."
1,"Ich habe mir mit dieser Scheibe wirklich Mühe gegeben, sie nach dem ersten Hören für einige Zeit erstmal wieder in die Schublade gelegt, um sie mir dann in anderer Stimmung nochmal zu Gemüte zu führen. Nach dem dritten Mal ist jetzt aber Sense: Ich kann's nicht mehr haben. Die Frau textet einen so dermaßen zu. Würde sie doch mal zwischendurch den Mund halten und nur die Musik spielen. Dieser pausenlose anstrengende, nervende Gesang macht die CD als Gesamtwerk einfach kaputt. Und bevor bei einem nächsten Hörversuch ein Familienmitglied angenervt die Fernbedienung auf den CD-Player feuert, verschenk ich die  Scheibe lieber an jemanden, die/der sich gern mal nen Knopf an die Backe labern läßt. Warum nur wird diese CD so in den Himmel gelobt???"
5,"Braucht die Welt noch eine Lohengrin-Aufnahme, wo es doch gerade von diesem Stück viele renommierte Aufnahmen gibt? Wenn das Ergebnis so ausfällt wie hier, dann doch eindeutig ja! Ich gebe allerdings zu, ein wenig voreingenommen zu sein, da ich eine der Aufführungen in der Kölner Philharmonie miterleben durfte und da wie wohl alle anderern 2000 Menschen überwältigt und begeistert war. Durch die konzertante Aufführung konnte man sich einmal voll auf die Musik konzentrieren und das zeigte mir den Lohengrin, nicht gerade mein Liebglingswerk, dann doch in neuem Licht. Nun verstand ich Richard Strauss, der die Instrumentation des Lohengrin stets als bedeutenden Fortschritt gerühmt hat und in der Tat, instrumental sind die Mittel für Ring, Meistersinger und Parsifal bereitet. Dazu kam das hypertrophe der Wagnerschen Vision hier so richtig zum Tragen, die bis zu 12 Trompeten, Fernorchester und -chöre, der Orgeleinsatz. Drei Chöre und aller Aufwand, den der Meister verlangte wurden dargeboten: Diese ""große"" romantische Oper ist so wirklich das kolossalste Stück zwischen Berlioz Requiem und Mahlers 8. Sinfonie. An äußerlicher Pracht und Gewalt hat Wagner das auch im Ring nicht mehr übertroffen - gottseidank! Bychkov hat das live großartig organisiert und zumindest ein Abglanz kommt so ins Wohnzimmer - um mit dem seligen Celibidache zu sprechen: Eine Erinnerung an eine großartige Aufführung, technisch großartig eingefangen, aber die Livedynamik war wohl nicht zu erzeugen. Vor dieser Folie ( oder auch Ballast?) mit allem, was die große Oper außer Ballett zu bieten hat, spielt nun das Drama der gescheiterten Beziehung, das Drama des einsamen Künstlers. Bychkov versucht hier erst garnicht, besondere Dramatik und Leidenschaft zu erzeugen, alles entwickelt sich organisch mit fast schuberthafter Lied- und Melodienseligkeit. Und dafür hat er tolle Sänger zur Verfügung: Johan Botha ist seit Seiffert der wohl beste Lohengrin, eine gut geführte Stimme, die an Kraft und Volumen deutlich gewonnen hat. Botha ist sicher auf dem Weg zum richtigen Heldentenor und gefällt mir besser als der arg dunkle Kaufmann und der wiederum sehr helle Klaus Florian Vogt (beide ungeachtet dessen tolle sänger!). Adrianne Pieczonka ist dagegen eine rührende, wunderschön leise beginnende Elsa, ganz zart, steigert sie sich aber zur emanzipierten Frau. Mir persönlich gefallen solche völlig vibratolosen und nicht gilfenden Sopran-Stimmen, auch wenn vielleicht ein wenig Leidenschaft fehlt. Petra Lang ist keine Keifzange, sondern eine schön gefährlich singende Ortrud. Kwangchul Youn muss nach seinem Bayreuther Debut nicht mehr gesonders gelobt werden, eine wunderbare Bassstimme und Eike Wilm Schulte macht aus dem Heerrufer immer wieder ein kleines Kabinettstückchen mit großer Stimme. Kein Schönsänger Falk Struckmann, aber auch er fügt sich ins Ensemble ein und bewältigt die undankbare Rolle imposant und versucht zumindest da und dort gebrochene Zwischentöne. Das WDR Orchester spielt einen klangsinnlichen, romantischen Wagner, die vereinten Chöre singen einfach überwältigend. Bychkov steuert überlegt und dafür manchmal umso überwältigender auf die großen Höhepunkte vor allem an den Aktschlüssen zu, die sich klanglich sicher kaum mehr steigern lassen. Mit dieser Klangfülle, den guten Sängern und der umsichtigen Orchesterleitung eine Konkurrenz zu Kempe und Kubelik, aufgrund des Klangbildes eigentlich den alten Aufnahmen vorzuziehen, insbesondere da stimmlich da auch nicht alles im grünen Bereich war: Otto Wiener, Fischer-Dieskau, die sonst hochverehrte Christa Ludwig eigentlich überfordert bei Kempe, Gwyneth Jones und die metallische Janowitz, James King mit hörbaren Problemen bei den ""Schwanengesängen"" - also da war früher auch nicht alles besser, wenn man mal sich die Zeit nimmt und Aufnahmen vorurteilsfrei nebeneinander hört."
2,"Ich glaube, diese Serie läuft sich langsam tot - irgendwie nix neues. Darum hier ein sehr guter Chill-Out-Music-Tipp: Das Album heißt ""Tapis Rouge Solarium"" vom Cirque du Soleil. Die Musik der Cirque du Soleil-Shows wurde hier sehr exelent  in erstklassige Chill-Out-Musik arangiert. Es gibt die Scheibe auch in einer Doppel-CD mit dem Titel ""Solarium/Delirium"". ""Solarium"" ist hier die Chill-Out-Fassung und ""Delirium"" ist eine Dance-Mix-Fassung, abgemixt von großen bekannten DJs (z.B. Tiesto), da geht die Post ab. Dieses Doppelalbum ist edel aufgemacht, bietet viel Abwechslung und ist somit empfehlenswert."
5,"Nach Pure, Odyssey und Treasure habe ich jetzt Prayer als Japan-Import von Amazon bezogen. Man erkennt eindeutig die musikalische Entwicklung von Hayley: die Stimme ist nach wie vor glasklar, die Songs sind aber etwas reifer, routinierter und souveräner interpretiert als auf den Alben zuvor. Für mich das Beste von Hayley bisher und die beste CD in meiner Sammlung überhaupt."
4,"Eigentlich wenn man diese schöne blondine so ansieht, denkt man gar nicht was diese Frau für eine Stimme hat. besinnlich, heftig und dann wieder ganz feminin. Die Texte sind allerdings zum Teil etwas Männerfeindlich. Find auch gut."
5,"michelle branch, avril lavigne und vanessa carlton sind die neue generation von sängerinnen die ihre köpfe durchsetzen und eigene musik machen! alle schreiben ihre songs selbst! auch michelle's spirit room hat mich voll und ganz überzeugt! neben den singles EVERYWHERE, ALL YOU WANTED und GOODBYE TO YOU sind diese songs weitere highlights der cd: SOMETHING TO SLEEP TO, HERE WITH ME und I'D RATHER BE IN LOVE! (1-10) Everywhere (10/10) You Get Me (8/10) All You Wanted (10/10) You Set Me Free (8/10): Klingt etwas zu ähnlich wie IF ONLY SHE KNEW aber dieses gefällt mir besser! Something To Sleep To (10/10) Here With Me (10/10) Sweet Misery (8,5/10) If Only She Knew (9/10) I'd Rather Be In Love (9,5/10) Goodbye To You (10/10) Drop In The Ocean (7,5/10)"
4,"The Doobie's biggest commercial success coincided with Michael McDonald's emergence as the leader of the band. His brilliant brand of sophisticated, keyboard-driven pop soul, as exemplified by the title track and the huge hit ""What a Fool Believes,"" was instantly identifiable and almost impossible to resist. There are tracks here that look back to the Doobie's earlier days as a biker boogie band, in particular ""Don't Stop to Watch the Wheels,"" and ""Steamer Lane Breakdown,"" a country song reminiscent of the Byrds' ""Nashville West."" But the sound here is mostly McDonald's!"
1,"Eine schöne Kopfstimme sollte man schon haben! ER hat sie definitiv nicht- Das hier ist in JEDEM Song ein schlimmel Gejaule. WER hat ihm eigentlich gesagt, dass er überhaupt einen Ton trifft? Das ALbum ist im grossen und ganzen eine Zumutung!"
1,"Die Petterson-Weihnachts-CD ist inhaltlich (textlich) dermassen trivial und an den Haaren herbei gezogen, dass sich einem die Fussnägel kräuseln! Ohne Petterson und Findus auf dem Cover (was haben DIE mit den LIEDERN zu tun???) hätte sich die 0815-CD sicher nicht verkaufen lassen. Von den ca. 50 Kinder-CDs in unserem Schrank ist dies mit Abstand die langweiligste und kommerziellste."
5,"""Joy of Life"" lässt die Gefühle und Gedanken auf die Reise gehen. Wer die Mystik Indiens, des Orients und Asiens liebt, kann bei dieser Musik so richtig entspannen, träumen, und abheben (evtl. tanzen?!). Karunesh ist hiermit ein wunderschönes Album gelungen."
4,"Ibo finde ich als Schlagersänger einfach Spitze. Dies, wieder eine Best-Of CD finde ich fast so gelungen wie die erste."
5,"Ich find' den Song cool! (wie bereits der Titel sagt...*grübel*) Anfangs war ich nicht so begeistert, dachte mir, dass er ein bisschen Britney mässig klingt. (An alle Fans, die mich für diesen Satz hassen: Ich bin selbst seit langem ein RIESEN AVRILFAN!!!) Nach mehrmaligem Hören fand ich ihn aber super! Obwohl ich sagen muss, dass es mir ein bisschen zu viele ""Hey""s und ""You""s drin hat. Aber insgesamt cool. Ich kann mir aber vorstellen, dass dieser Song nicht alle Fans ansprechen wird, weil er nicht viel mit den Songs von UMS gemeinsam hat."
5,"Auf diesem Album verwandelt sich Tom Waits in einen alten ratternden Güterzug, der sich seinen Weg durch die Gluthitze der amerikanischen Südstaaten bahnt. Er scheppert und kracht sich durch 16 Songs, die es auf beachtliche 72 Minuten Gesamtspielzeit bringen. Musikalisch besinnt sich Tom Waits mehr denn je auf den ""echten"" Blues der schwarzen Plantagenarbeiter, der im Gegensatz zum Blues des Pop aus echtem Leiden und echter Hoffnung entstand, während der Blues der Popkultur dies eher zur Schau trägt. Trotz des tontechnischen Firlefanz ist dieses Album also vor allem eines: authentisch! Für mich splittet sich die Platte in drei Kategorien von Titeln: extrem rhythmische, aber melodiöse (genial: hoist, shake, barn), extrem rhythmische, aber penetrante (hill, metro) sowie typische Waits-Balladen (sins,cnd). Auch die penetranten, anstrengenden Titel tragen zum Charakter dieser CD bei. Für so viele unzeitgemäße Ecken und Kanten kann es nur 5 Sterne geben!! Noch dazu sucht dieser kräftige, erdige Klang (meines Wissens nach) in der Popgeschichte seines Gleichen."
5,"Habe mir die CD auf gut Glück in Spanien gekauft, weil sie dort Nummer 1 war, und ich muss sagen, nach dem ersten Mal Anhören, weiss man warum. Bin mir sicher die CD gefällt nicht nur den Spaniern. Vor allem ""Hoy Llueve, Hoy Duele"" ist Spitze."
5,"Die Überraschung des Jahres: ein rundum gelungenes Album von hoher Qualität &amp; Sound und einer Stimme die unter die Haut geht. Wäre unser Zeitalter nicht von ""Musikvideo"" und ""DSDSS"" und sonstigem Unsinn bestimmt (und wir wären noch in den 80er Jahren) so wären sicherlich ein oder zwei der Songs in den Charts plaziert. So bleibt uns eine herausragende Sängerin mit einer einzigartigen Stimme. Und wer dieses hören möchte wird nicht enttäuscht werden. Mein Tipp: Kaufen und immer wieder hören!"
1,"Die wird von Jahr zu Jahr immer schlechter! Die No Angels zB. Mit diesem alten schinken darauf. Oder Dieser soundtrack von Spiderman,ich kann ihn schon nicht mehr hören."
2,"Ich kann nicht verstehen, wer die Songs bei Bravo Hits aussucht. Es ist seit langem so, dass immer weniger ""echte"" Hits zu finden sind und immer mehr ""Lückenfüller"". Auch wenn die Konzeption sicher einiges an Zeit in Anspruch nimmt, kann man meiner  Meinung nach durchaus kurzfristig einige Songs austauschen. Im Vergleich zu anderen Samplern, die auch mit der Hitgarantie werben, ist Bravo Hits zwar noch besser (deshalb 2 Sterne), aber immer noch zu schlecht. Die 2 Highlights der CD wiegen den Rest nicht auf. Weshalb fehlt eigentlich die gesamte Top 5? Schade Bravo Hits, für diese CD gibt es keinen Applaus."
5,"Yeah, so sehe ich diese LP. ""Endgegner"" ging mir bereits unter die Haut, und nach ""Augenblick"" sprang der Funke dann vollends über!! Weiters lache ich mich über ""Ab 18"" feat. Saad ab, bekomme bei ""Sieh in meine Augen"" richtig buchstäblich Tränen in den Augen, und der Titeltrack bounct einfach nur unaufhörlich. Ich wiederhole: Die vorliegendeLP stellt Bushido auf dem damaligen Höhepunkt seines Schaffens zur Schau. Der Nachfolger ""Vorn der Skyline zum Bordstein zurück"" hatte dann zwar eben schon deutlich weniger Biss, wie ich auch in entsprechender Rezension schreibe, doch mit ""7"" hat sich der Mann prompt wieder in aller Ohren gespielt. Deutscher Aggrorap 4eva!!!"
5,"also,allein an den 3 snippets dies auf bushidos Homepage gibt,kann man einfach nur sagen,dass dieses Album zum besten überhaupt gehört. Bushido bringt nicht nur seinen bekannten harten Style in Liedern wie ""Ab 18"" ins Rollen,sondern überzeugt auch in ruhigen Trackz zum Thema Liebe.... Der Typ is einfach der Beste"
2,"Ich bin ein Eminem Fan und kann mir seine beiden ersten Alben gar nicht genug anhören!!! Aber die Rezessionen die ich gelesen habe stoßen bei mir auf Unverständniss! Dieses Album hat nicht annährend die Qualitäten seiner Vorgänger. Von Wegen schöne Melodien und Rhytmen ala ""Stan"", mag ja sein das ""Sing For the Momment"" eine schöne Melodie hat, het es auch aber ""Stan""   hatte neben diesem ABSOLUT GENIALEN BEAT UND RHYTMUS UND DIESER MELODIE auch eine bewegende Geschichte, was man von ""Sing For The Momment"" (5:30 min nur Refrain) nicht behaupten kann, was man von FAST keinem dieser Lieder behaupten kann. DA SIND ÜBERHAUPT KEINE TEXTE: Lieder 3,4,7,12,13,14 bestehen nur aus einer zugegeben schönen Melodie und einem Refrain!!! An Lieder wie STAN, Bad Meets Evil, Still Don't Give A F***, THE WAY I AM, Marshall Mathers und Criminal kommen diese neuen meiner Meinung nach einfach nicht ran. Diesen (überaus verdienten) Erfolg, den Eminem mit ""The Marshall Mathers LP"" erungen hatte (LEIDER nur fast ""BEST ALBUM OF THE YEAR"" bei den Grammys) wird er denke ich mit diesem Albun nicht schaffen.  Alles in einem, nicht Überragend."
1,Eminem könnt ihr alle vergessen! Die von den Medien gebuschten Tracks hat nichts mit Hip Hop zu tun. Diese Möchtegern HipHopper meinen dass sie thight wie weiß Gott wer sind nur weil sei Eminem hören! Das kotzt mich richtig an! Nur dass es einmal gesagt wird!!!
2,Also das Album ist gut aber nicht zum umhauen es gab bessere deutschrap alben  2 Sterne nur weil sido die hohen erwartungen nicht einhalten konnte der hochgelobte testament track war doch nicht so gut und schade ist das da keine battleraps vor kommen und dann gibts zu viele skitz was sehr witzig war und tracks die nur 1-2 minuten dauern. Von diesem Album gefallen mir nur 4 Tracks. Meiner meinung nur was für Aggro fans.
5,"Das Pariser Label Kitsune zeigt mit seiner dritten Maison Compilation erneut wie elegant sich aktueller Electrohousesound und 80er Gitarrensound kombinieren lassen. Zum Einstieg gibts die grandiosen Simian Mobile Disco mit dem Ohrwurm ""I Believe"", dann folgen The Lovely Feathers mit ""Frantic"", das fast schon Funpunk ist. The World Domination vs Adam Sky ""Galactiv Lover"" erinnert sowohl vom Sound als auch den Vocals stark an Gary Numan. Boys Noize ""Feel Good"" ist ein minimaler kratziger Electrokracher vom feinsten, der einfach süchtig macht. Gossips ""Standing in the way"" mit fast souligen Vocals wurde von Soulwax zu einer wunderbar trashigen Electroclashhymne remixt. Zum Abschluss dann der melancholische Gitarrentrack ""Done with you"" von The Whitest Boy Alive, sicher der ultimative Song für alle die gerade eine Trennung hinter sich haben. Wer am Ende des Songs etwas Geduld hat bekommt nach ca. einminütiger Pause dann noch einen fetten Mix von Digitalisms Zdarligt zu hören, der eigentümlicherweise keinen eigenen Track zugewiesen bekommen hat.  Fazit: Kitsune definieren für mich eine Klasse für sich. So macht Gitarrenmusik auch Fans elektronischer Musik wieder richtig Spaß."
4,"Elephant Man's erster longplayer als single artist ist der hammer... Wenn ihr auf dancehall musik steht dann ist diese cd/lp Pflicht für euch. Ich gebe der cd aber ""nur"" 4 sterne weil 2-3 songs nix sind, aber der Rest rockt... Für mich ist das Album schon jetzt ein Klassiker!! Also ziehts euch rein..."
1,"Ich hab mir die CD zum Glück nicht selbst gekauft (mein Geld lieber ins neue Savas-Album gesteckt), aber sie bei einem Freund gehört und war entsetzt. Dass Eko nach der -Ich Will Dich EP- noch schlechter werden kann hab ich echt nicht gegelaubt. Die Grenze senkte sich dann aber mit der -L.O.V.E.- Maxi und diesem runden Schandstück der Musik. Zwei Hackfressen machen einen auf R'n'B. Eko ist aber das kleinere Problemn dieser CD, das größere ist Freundin Valezka, die schon bei Optik durch Talentfreiheit aufgefallen ist. Wie kann sich Eko innerhalb weniger Monate seit seinem Split von Optik so verschlechtern? Wird mir wohl ewig ein Rätsel bleiben. Ich glaub ich denk drüber nach während ich ein bisschen -Die  Besten Tage Sind Gezählt- von SAV, dem wahren König von Deutschland, höre *rofl*!!!"
5,"Da dieses Album ein best-of ist kennt ein Orishas Fan, der sämtliche Platten besitzt, natürlich alle Lieder bis auf die 3 neuen, doch es ist wie gesagt ein Best-of und dieses ist wirklich wunderbar gelungen! Als  noch nicht-Fan erhält man einen guten Überblick über den musikalischen Stil der Exil-Cubaner und deren musikalischen Talent. Für mich war auf keinem ihrer bisherigen Alben auch nur ein schlechter Track, so dass es in meinen Augen schwierig ist, überhaupt ein 1-Disc Best-of zu machen. Es hätten noch so viele andere Songs verdient, auf diesem Album zu sein, jedoch ist die Tracklist überaus gelungen und bringt ein bisschen Cuba ins eigene Heim. Die Orishas mischen klassiche cubanische und lateinamerikanische Musik á la Buena Vista Social Club mit Rap, was sich wirklich sehr gut verträgt und einfach nur melodisch ist. Es ist einfach nur gute Musik, die den Sommer, das Lebensgefühl Cubas und gute Laune mit sich bringt. Eine klare Kaufenpfehlung für all diejenigen, die diese Gruppe noch nicht entdeckt haben, bzw noch keine CD besitzen."
5,"Die Seltenheit der guten Klänge...hier hat man auf jeden Fall ein Album, das in seiner Ganzheit überzeugt!"
5,die Shayne da als 2te Single aus seinem gleichnamigen Album veröffentlicht. Auf seiner Homepage kann ma sich sogar schon das Video zum Song ansehen. Es wird auch einen Song auf der Single geben der nicht auf dem Album ist. Ein kauf lohnt sich also. Wie schon die 4 Singles die bereits erschienen sind und sein sensationelles Debütalbum wird auch diesmal nicht an Deutschland gedacht. Single und Album werden nur in England erscheinen. Schade wie ich finde. Ich denke das Shayne auch bei uns seine Fans finden wird.
5,"Azad - ein MC wie kein anderer, da dürfte mir wohl jeder Fan und Neider zustimmen. Erstmal schon dieses Organ: tief, bedrohlich, und immer unter die Haut gehend, ob nun melancholisch oder aggressiv. Und die Beats sind in beiden Fällen immer 1a produziert. Klare Anspieltips habe ich hier zu nennen: In erster Linie möchte ich hier die ÜBERGEILEN, wenn auch oder vielleicht grad weil so melancholisch, tiefsinnig gehalten: ""Tage des Regens"" mit J-Luv im Refrain, ""Du fehlst mir"", ""Ich geh für dich"" mit Joy Delane, ""Alles Lügen"" und ""Ich bete zu dir"". Bei diesen Tracks gilt das Folgende, was für mich die Besonderheit der Scheibe ausmacht: Azad mag tiefsinnige Texte performen, die inhaltlich vielleicht manche als Schnulzen abtun könnten, doch seine tiefe, grollende Stimme nimmt diesem Urteil jede Kraft, da der Schnulzenfaktor damit schlichtweg niedergewalzt wird!! Speziell ""Tage des Regens"" und ""Du fehlst mir"" erzeugt bei mir eine Gänsehaut, das sind Tracks für die Ewigkeit, für jedermann!! Sooo schön... Ein Battlerapper mit Herz!!! Man höre und genieße ;)"
2,"weiß nicht so recht was ich von Kanye's neuem Album halten soll. ""Stronger"" gefällt mir persönlich ganz gut, aber wenn man den Song zu oft hört wirkt er schnell ausgeleiert.. ""Can't Tell Me Nothing"" gefällt mir persönlich nicht so wirklich v.a. der Beat spricht mich nicht wirklich an. ""Barry Bonds"" feat. Lil Wayne, der feature sagt meiner Meinung nach viel über den Song aus.. durchschnittlich, gehyped bis zum geht nicht mehr. Lil Wayne ist einfach nur schlecht, der meistgehypte Junge des Jahres.. naja, vom rest der grade mal 14 Songs erwarte ich nicht viel. Werds mir weder kaufen noch sonstwie zulegen.. sorry Kanye"
5,"Beats, Textgehalt, Wortwitz, Stimmung... alles passt. Ob die elektronisch modulierte Stimme Kanye's gefällt, ist Geschmackssache. Klar ist aber, das Producing und Ideenreichtum deutlich zur Gestaltung, Qualität und Klangerlebnis guter Tracks beitragen, was diese Platte positiv unter Beweis stellt."
1,Also diese sogenannten Sommerhits sind ja eigentlich immer schon deshalb total nervig weil sie ungefär 10 mal täglich zu hören sind! Aber dieses 'Lied' ist nun wirklich das schlimmste was ich so kenne. Stellenweise kann man da doch wirklich weder von Melodie noch von Gesang reden. Mir bleibt da nur die Hoffnung auf den Winter!!!!
5,"Warum verschwinden hier laufend negative Kritiken an diesem wirklich belanglosen Stück Musik?  Ist Nevio an amazon beteiligt?  Mir kommt das reichlich seltsam vor und riecht stark nach Zensur.  Muss diese CD einfach verkauft werden???  Spart Euch bei diesem ""KÜNSTLER"" die Rezension, hier wird Schönfärberei GROSS geschrieben...."
2,"Nö, das muss nicht sein. Auch nach mehrmaligem Hören will sich kein Freudenerlebnis einstellen, ganz im Gegenteil. Der miserable ""Sänger"" zersägt jeglichen Ansatz. Schade drum, die Nachfolgealben sind eindeutig besser."
1,"Modern Talking usually doesn't follow the road less traveled, but sticks with its safe, money-making style, which you will either love or hate. If you have one of his song, and then you have all of his albums!"
2,"Die Rocker von Monster Magnet sind zurück und legen ihr neuestes Album namens ""4-way diablo"" vor! Nach den ganzen Alkohol- und Drogenproblem ihres Fronters Dave Wyndorf können die Fans ja froh sein, dass es überhaupt noch einmal zu der Aufnahme eines regulären Studioalbums gekommen ist! In Bezug auf Live-Auftritten wird sich die Band ja bekanntlich in nächster Zeit vornehm zurückhalten. Vielleicht auch besser so, denn der vierfache Teufel drängt sich bei mir nicht besonders in die Gehörgänge. Meiner Meinung nach bieten Monster Magnet auf ihrem neuen Album nicht mehr als durchschnittlichen und teilweise einfach langweiligen Rock. Der Opener ""4-way diablo"" ist schon bestes Beispiel für die Mittelmäßigkeit dieser Scheibe: Ein uninspirierter Vers trifft auf einen eher uneingängigen Refrain. Auch mit der Stimme von Wyndorf kann ich nicht besonders viel anfangen. Und so zieht sich der ganze Brei das ganze Album hindurch hin! Kein Titel, der wirklich aus der Einheit herausstechen könnte! Ein unterdurchschnittlicher Song reiht sich an den nächsten und zum Ende der Platte hin wird es fast noch schlimmer! Viel mehr kann ich zu diesem Silberling leider nicht sagen, außer dass er bei bis auf Langeweile rein gar nichts bewirkt! 2 Sterne gebe ich nur für die Tatsache, dass es Monster Magnet überhaupt noch geschafft haben ein Album aufzunehmen! Wer ""4-way diablo"" nicht kennt, verpasst meines Erachtens einfach rein gar nichts..."
5,"Ich war zugegebenermaßen nicht besonders begeistert, als ich hörte, dass die Scorpions ein Akustik-Projekt planten. Als Rockgruppe sind und waren sie ja exzellent. Aber ein reines Akustik-Album, das sollte funktionieren?"
2,"Meine Bewertung gliedert sich in Präsentation, Interpretation und Tonqualität der Titel auf. Die Tracks sind gut aufeinander abgestimmt und ordentlich präsentiert. Jedoch Rainbow ist nicht Deep Purple; kompositorisch und auf die Musikerqualitäten bezogen. Das soll nicht bedeuten Rainbow hat schlechtere Musiker aber das Niveau von Deep Purple konnte Rainbow nie erreichen. Rainbow ist Blackmores Begleitband; was auch durchaus in Ordnung ist. Wer die solistischen Endlosinterpretationen Blackmores liebt, wird mit allen Rainbow Live Zusammenstellungen zufriedengestellt. Die Tonqualität läßt, zumindest bei meiner Pressung einiges zu wünschen übrig:  ein sehr ausgeprägter Nebengeräuschpegel - Rauschpegel, sehr schlechte Frequenzabstimmung - der Bassbereich ist  kaum vorhanden und eine extrem dominant abgemischte Gitarre. Dies führt zur 2 Sterne Wertung. Die 2 Sterne vergebe ich fast ausschließlich aufgrund der Songs; vor allem Stargazer live - endlich mal auf einer CD. Stargazer live ist auch das einzige Argument für den Kauf dieser CD."
1,"Also ich weiß nicht woher eigentlich diese Band Keane oder auch andere wie z. B. Sow Patrol ihre Daseinsberechtigung ziehen. Denn letzlich sind sie nur eine fade verwässerte Version der ansich schon langweiligen Coldplay. Hat die Welt diesen Abklatsch gebraucht? Ich denke nicht, den diese Leute machen Musik nur um des Geldes wegen. Diese Art von Musiker hat den riesengroßen Erfolg von Coldplay, mir zwar unverständlich, gesehen und will jetzt auch daran partizipieren. Diese Musiker haben keine eigenen Ideen, sie nehmen nur Dinge auf und verünnen sie und verkaufen sie dann. Diese Personen würden morgen auch Gebrauchtwagen verkaufen, wenn damit mehr Geld als im Musikbusiness zu machen wäre. Ich persönlich mag meine Musik mit Ecken und Kanten, muß mich daran reiben können, mich damit auseinander setzen können. Das ist hier absolut nicht der Fall. Hier ist alles poliert und geschliefen bis das nichts mehr da ist was den Zuhörer packen könnte. Gut zugegeben die Texte sind nicht zu schlecht, es wird viel über Verust und Schmerz referiert. Wenn ich gute Texte will kaufe ich mir ein Buch mit entsprechender Prosa, denn hier laufen Text und Musik nicht zusammen. Ist mal textlich was spannend ruiniert dieser langweilige Sound alles. Was bleibt ist für mich zumindest ein sehr fader Nachgeschmack bei diesem Album. Ja, es kommen einem sogar so verwegene Gedanken wie, wäre es nicht gut wenn die gesamten CD-Verkaufszahlen soweit in die Knie gingen, daß diese Art von Bands es nicht mehr interessant fänden ins Musikgeschäft einzusteigen und wieder Gebrauchtwagenverkäufer würden. Ein weiterer Nebeneffekt wäre, daß die großen Plattenfirmen auch verschwinden würden, den diese machen mit ihrer Politik Bands zu verpflichten auch vieles kaputt. Hey, die klingen wie Coldplay und die machen ein Haufen Kohle für uns, laßt uns noch jede Menge Bands verpflichten die genauso klingen. Das ist Gebrauchtwagenverkäufermentalität, langes Wort, aber so ist es nun mal. Heute wird Musik wie Cola verkauft und das kann auf Dauer nicht gut gehen. Es wird wieder Zeit das Leute mit Enthusiasmus für Musik das Business übernehmen und diese BWLer zum Teufel jagen."
5,"Dass das alles schon mal dagewesen ist, von der Cover Art bis zu den Songs ist offensichtlich. Aber: Es geht nicht darum, das Rad neu zu erfinden! Es geht schlichtweg darum, den Ohren was Gutes zu tun. Oasis können das, bedienen sich geschickt der Beatles, MC 5, Ihrer Selbst, der Happy Mondays. Definitely maybe the best album since years."
1,"...ist die Tatsache, dass Bands wie die ""Sportfreunde Stiller"" sich großer Beliebtheit erfreuen. Was sich auf ""Burli"" findet lässt sich am besten als seichte Musik für Pubertierende beschreiben. Die langweilige und farblose Stimme des Sängers lenkt leider nicht genug von den meist einfallslosen und sinnfreien Texten ab, die begleitet von radiotauglichen Popmelodien mit schlecht geklauten Punk-Anleihen aus den Boxen klingen. Wer die Single ""Ich Roque"" kennt, sollte diese gleich als Warnung vor dem Album selbst verstehen. So klingen die Sportfreunde genau wie die Stereotypen mit Alternative-Aushängeschild, die sie in der Single mehr schlecht als recht parodieren. Die Sportfreunde mit ähnlichen Bands zu vergleichen, fällt mir angesichts der vielen Schwächen ziemlich schwer. 1 Sternchen gibts trotzdem - für die ausgefallene Idee, sich selbst zu parodieren..."
5,"In dieser CD zeigt sich wieder die besondere Spielfreude von Blechschaden. So klingt es, wenn erstklassige Orchestermusiker freigelassen werden! (Das Blech fristet im Orchester häufig ein Schattendasein). Charakteristisch ist der weite Bogen durch die Musikgeschichte: Vom Oboenkonzert von Händel über Kalinka und Zwiefachen bis zum Rock. Das der Triumpfmarsch aus Aida auch auf Gartenschläuchen gespielt werden kann, beweist Blechschaden eindrucksvoll! Als Fan der Brass-Szene (ich spiele selbst Posaune) ist diese CD von Blechschaden für mich die gelungenste Aufnahme und ein Muss für jeden Brass-Fan."
1,"Wien schon der Rezensist vor mir schön beschrieben hat ist diese Platte eine unnötige Veröffentlichung. Wieso macht jemand so etwas??? Wieso muss bei Re-Releases immer alles neu eingespielt werden?? (Megadeath hat dies auch gemacht, ist genauso mies wie unnötig geworden). Das Originale Album ""Blizzard of Ozz"" is eine geniale Scheibe, und ich kann jedem nur empfehlen sich NUR!!! das Original oder die remastered Version von 1995 (die mit dem blauen Rahmen) zu kaufen. Diese hier ist nur rausgemschissenes Geld, und hat rein gar nichts mehr mit dem Original zu tun."
5,"endlich. das lange warten hat sich gelohnt. heute früh war das neue werk der selbsternannten (zu recht) düsterpoeten im briefkasten. lange habe ich auf diesen moment gewartet. nachdem illuminate in den letzten jahren mit ""kaltes licht"" einen kleinen ausrutscher in meinen augen verbockt haben, danach mit den beiden ""10x10"" wieder einen großen treffer landeten, und danach mit ""augenblicke"" ein zwiespältiges produkt ablieferten, ist das neue meisterwerk wieder ganz nach meinem geschmack. 9 titel, bei denen ich fast nicht sagen kann, welcher mein liebster ist (na gut, nach zwei mal hören auch schwierig). ganz große klasse vom ersten bis zum letzten ton, mit sehr raffiniertem spieluhr-intro und outro, das für gänsehaut sorgt. mit rockigen tönen und altbekannten wundervollen melodien schmeichelt sich die band sofort wieder in die herzen der fans. tolle texte, wundervoll gesungen (mit zwei sehr guten gastsängerinnen), gehen voll unter die haut. als bonus liegt der cd ein livealbum bei: 60 minuten konzert in mexico. nach 13 jahren ein super geschenk an die fans. die atmosphäre des konzertes ist hervorragend eingefangen, und in einer stunde schaffen es illuminate (fast) alle großen hits ihrer karriere auf cd zu bannen. ein ganz toller bonus. fazit: ich, als großer fan der trilogie, finde ""zwei seelen"" mit abstand eines der besten alben, das illuminate je veröffentlicht hat. die heavy töne und echten schlagzeugeinlagen stehen der band gut zu gesicht. illuminate werden es schwer haben, diese geile cd zu toppen."
1,"Den Lobeshymnen kann ich mich nun wirklich nicht anschliessen. Die alten Lacrimosa Platten fand ich wirklich gut, diese karg inszenierten Platten lassen einem die Gänsehaut über den Rücken fahren. Dann begann Lacrimosa mehr auf Melodie zu setzen - sicherlich nicht schlecht, man denke nur an das Album Inferno oder Stille. Aber was Lacrimosa dann taten, war keine Meisterleistung: sie entdeckten den totalen Bombast für sich. Erste Ausgeburt: Elodia, ein Tiefpunkt in Ihrer Karriere. Sehr gut liess sich das auf Konzerten beobachten: bei alten Sachen tolle Stimmung, bei den neuen nur noch gnädiger Beifall. Fassade, ging wieder in die richtige Richtung, ein bisschen mehr Rock und dafür weniger Klassik. Doch jetzt das: Echos. Das ist das schlechtesteste was ich die letzen 5 Jahre gehört habe. Es sollten sich bitte nur Leute an Klassik versuchen, die es können. Mit dem 12 - Min. Kyrie  fängt Echos an uns zu quälen, dabei ist das noch der beste Song auf dem Album. ""Kyrie"" möchte man auch Tilo Wolff zurufen. Aber schon geht es weiter mit ""Durch Nacht und Flut"". Kitschig, voller Pathos und irgendwie wird man bei der ganzen Platte das Gefühl nicht los, das alles schon mal gehört zu haben. Vermutlich auf Elodia. Eine musikalische Weiterentwicklung ist nicht mehr zu erkennen, Lacrimosa watschen im tiefen Sumpf der Mittelmässigkeit. Bezeichnend der Name des letzen Liedes: ""Die Schreie sind verstummt"". Ja, wenn die Platte vorbei, dann stimmt das. Den einen Punkt habe ich wegen Mitleid vergeben und wegen dem schön aufgemachten Digi-Pack mit einem wirklich gelungen Artwork. Macht sich zumindest ganz gut im Regal die Platte. Da wird sie auch noch lange', lange liegen."
2,"Tom Jones, ""the tiger"" kommt bei dieser Scheibe ganz gut rüber, jedoch -und das muss ich ebenfalls leider bestätigen - ist die Aufnahmequalität zwischen misserabel und unakzeptabel. Die ""Tiger""platten aus den 60/70ern sind unabhängig von den Songs wesentlich besser aufgenommen und nerven nicht nach zwei/drei Lieder. Aufgrund der misserablen Tonqualität habe ich die Lieder bisher nur ""durchzappen"" können. Bereits bei der Tom Jones &amp; Jools Holland CD ist die Aufnahmequalität mittelmäßig.. die (leider) bei 24 Hours noch im Neg. getoppt wird. Sorry, aber selbst als großer Tigerfan kann ich hier nichts Positives an dieser Scheibe abgewinnen... leider."
1,Bei dieser CD ist nicht mehr drinnen was draufsteht. CD1 ist wieder mit massig HandsUP verunstaltet und CD2 besteht nun aus Hardstyle. Mit Trance hat das leider nichts mehr zu tun...
5,"jeder der deutschen punkrock mag, sollte diese platte besitzen. aggressiv und ungeschliffen. leider ist die cd-version der lp klangtechnisch unterlegen. da waren beim digitalisieren wohl amateuere am werk. es wurden offenbar nicht die masterbänder verwendet. egal. :-) leider ist ""polizei sa ss"" verboten worden und deshalb nicht mehr enthalten. je nach aktueller meinung der bundesprüfstelle sind ""deutschland"" und ""bullenschweine"" auch mal mit pieptönen versehen. da man den text trotzdem mitbekommt, ist das wohl eher als unfreiwillige komik der zensoren zu werten. :)"
5,Muss unter mir echt zustimmen.Hab mir Dance House 1+2 gekauft.Einfach der Hammer.Mit diesen CD's ist die Party gerettet.Nicht lang überlegen.....kaufen.
1,"Leider überzeugt ein DSDS-Sieger (wieder einmal) nicht mit seinem Sieger-Titel. Nach 1 Jahr Pause wieder ein Song aus der feder von Dieter Bohlen und das merkt man dem Song vom 1. bis zum letzten Ton an. Langeweile und schon zigmal gehörtes verbreitet sich im Ohr und kann den Hörer mit musikalischem Anspruch keineswegs begeistern. Auch die Stimme des von der DSDS-Jury seit Monaten gepushten Sängers vermag nciht zu überzeugen, verfügt sie doch nicht über den so oft geforderten und im Musikgeschäft nötigen Wiedererkennungswert. Insgesamt enttäuschend. Der Song wird nur auf Grund des allgemeinen Hypes um die Sendung charten, verident hat er es mangels Qualität allerdings nicht."
1,"Als langjähriger Fan und Sammler der ???,der quasi mit den Jungs aus Rocks Beach aufgewachsen ist, habe ich versucht mich ohne Vorurteile auf die ""neue"" Serie einzulassen. An den, in meine Augen,reichlich misslungenen, neuen Namen, des guten alten Justus, jetzt Jupiter, konnte ich mich ja noch gewöhnen, auch habe ich versucht über die teilweise sehr flachen Dialoge der neuen Folgen hinweg zu sehen, aber der neuste Track "" Tödliche Regie"" ist selbst mit viel Wohlwollen und Nachsicht nicht zu entschuldigen. Platte Story, überdrehte Charaktäre und dann noch dieses furchtbar nervige ""Gejammere"" von Panik Porky... eine Zumutung für Geist und Gehör. Bleibt nur zu hoffen, dass dies nicht das Ende einer interessanten und erfreulichen Hörspielserie ist und die Produzenten es schaffen, das Ruder wieder herumzureißen."
1,"Also mehr als gar nix kann mann da nix sagen nur klodeckel auf und kräftig abkotzen diese musik ist propaganda für dummheit noch nicht mal der text hat irgend ein sinn siehe dum dum dabi dam ode so oder shubidubi doo ich habe echt zweiffel ob etwas aus unserer ""naechsten generation"" wird oder ob wir nur auf solche treffen die sich sowas wie shooobiduu reinziehen und als intelektuel ansehen also ziemlich kranke leute"
5,"Erst im Jahre 1984 wurde diese bereits 1969 aufgenommene Musik von George Benson erstmals veröffentlicht. Plattenkritiker sprechen sogar von einer ""mysteriösen Schallplatte"". Und nun liegt das Ganze endlich als Neuveröffentlichung auf CD in perfekt remastertem Sound vor. Hier erleben wir George Benson in wahrer Spiellaune - vom Jazz her kommend. Wunderschöne langsame, sparsam besetzte Stücke wechseln ab mit groovigen Jazz-Titeln. Reizvoll sind - insgesamt betrachtet - die beiden unterschiedlichen Arrangements auf den ehemaligen Vinylplattenseiten A und B. Also, die ersten 4 sehr knackig arrangierten Stücke werden von Bensons superbem Gitarrenspiel, einer supercoolen Hammondorgel und den bestechenden Congas Ray Barrettos dominiert. Die Stücke 5 bis 9 hingegen kommen wesentlich ""smoother"" und durch ein großes Orchester opulent arrangiert ins Ohr. Herausragend sind die beiden reinen George-Benson-Stücke ""Bluesadelic"" und ""Durhams's Turn"". Sie stechen meilenweit aus der Auswahl der anderen Stücke hervor. Hätte Benson sich damals gegen das eher kommerzielle Konzept des A&amp;M-Plattenproduzenten Creed Taylors durchgesetzt und durchweg Eigenkompositionen eingespielt, es wäre eine 10-Sterne-CD dabei herausgekommen. So oder so ist diese CD ein Kleinod und ein feines Sahnestückchen zum Genießen!"
2,"bono beschrieb dieses album vorab als ""platinum-soul"", ein für mich ganz typischer freud'scher versprecher, denn er trifft, wenn auch ungewollt den nagel auf den kopf, meint dieses ""platinum"" doch weniger die dauerhaftígkeit und exklusivität der musik als vielmehr die eigentliche auslegung dieses albums, nämlich als ""mehrfachplatin-album"" mit radiofreundlichen, aber meist wenig einfallsreichen und noch viel weniger tiefgründigen (""elevation!!!! huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh, huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh"") songs."
1,"Man, man, man, ich liebe Depeche, aber was ist das denn? Das ist nicht die Band die ich kenne und liebe. ""Wrong"" würde ich sagen trifft es gut! Ich hoffe nur, sie könnnen die Ketten (In Chains) abwerfen und ein echtes Comeback starten. Ich meine, wir sind nicht bei SETI, nicht bei der Spacenight auf BR-Alpha, sondern bei der von uns so geliebten Depeche Mode. Die Musik ist facettenlos, fad, einfach, C64. Das sind nicht mehr die Music for the Masses, sondern allenfalls für lesses. Das gute TR 808 Drumset wird wieder hervorgeholt (was nicht unbedingt schlecht sein muss), aber die Sounds drumherum sind so schräg arrangiert, als lausche man den Radiowellen einer Supernova. Das ist dann auch nicht mehr innovativ. Pure Verschwendung von Gahans Stimme. Naja, das Album wird untergehen in der Menge des Nichts, des Alls. Das könnt ihr besser, Depeche!"
5,"Neben den vielen bekannten Hitsingles (die immer noch im Radio gespielt werden) finden sich auf der ""Best of"" auch viele unbekanntere und dennoch sehr hörenswerte Stücke wie z. B. PEG, MIDNIGHT CRUISER, BABYLON SISTERS oder KID CHARLEMAGNE."
5,"Hier steckt eindeutig eine Menge Arbeit drin! Mit großem Aufwand wurde eine einwandfreie Produktion geschaffen und jeder der wirklich etwas von Musik versteht wird das erkennen.  Ansonsten ist alles Geschmackssache, vom Songwriting über die Arrangements bis zu (uff...) Axl's Stimme (an der es übrigens entgegen sämtlicher ""Legenden"" die hier kursieren und die ich langsam nicht mehr hören kann NICHT DAS GERINGSTE zu bemängeln gibt, Axl klang noch nie so vielfältig wie auf diesem Album). Der Sound ist viel rockiger und schärfer, nicht mehr so rotzig und düdelig wie zu den Zeiten von Slash und Izzy. Stilistisch ist die Platte kaum mit den alten GN'R zu vergleichen. Sie ist deutlich komplexer, die Songs scheinen viel stärker miteinander verflochten zu sein, einzelne Hits wird man nicht finden. Das erinnert mich eher an frühe Rockalben aus den Siebzigern, als ganze Alben noch als solche produziert wurden und nicht als Ansammlung einzelner Stücke gesehen wurden, wie das heute üblicherweise der Fall ist. Daher bin ich sehr gespannt was die nächste Singleauskopplung wird, irgendwie gibt es hier kaum was Massen-Radiotaugliches, mit Ausnahme von ""Street of Dreams"" oder vielleicht ""Better"". Mein Fazit: Gut gemacht, ganz anders als früher, ich mag's. Daher fünf Sterne. Freue mich schon auf die nächste CD in 14 Jahren... ;o)"
5,"Platinum ist das 'lange Stück' dieser CD. Es kommt durchweg flott daher und ist ziemlich beschwingt. Trotzdem hat es auch echte Tiefe und Originalität, die sich hinter dem lockeren Äußeren verbirgt. Ein Titel, den ich auch nach über zehn Jahren immer noch hören kann. Woodhenge gibt sich extrem geheimnissvoll ohne 'das Rätsel' jemals wirklich aufzulösen. 'Punkadiddle' ist toll und insbesondere der Anfang von George Gershwin's 'I got Rhythm' echt bezaubernd."
5,"Lange gewartet und darauf gefreut, dass ich die CD endlich in Händen halten kann.  Einfach nur Gänsehautfeeling.  Wer die alten Lieder kennt und auch Michi schon live gesehen hat, wird begeistert sein."
5,"1977,als diese Platte erschien,war die große Karriere der ""Animals"" eigentlich schon durch.Diese war in den Mitt-und End -Sechzigern. Es sollte eigentlich nur ein Comeback ""so zum Spaß"" sein. Leider ist mir über die Verkaufszahlen und somit die Akzeptanz der Fans nichts bekannt,aber diese Scheibe ist wirklich genial. Verschiedene Cover-Versionen aus dem Blues-Rock-Bereich wecken beim Fan Erinnerungen,wie z.B. ""Please Send Me Someone To Love"",""Fire On The Sun"" oder das von ""Them"" zum Hit gewordene ""It`s All Over Now,Baby Blue"",bei dem Sänger Eric Burdon ein gewaltiges Stimm-Volumen zeigt. Über allem thront das ...fantastische,großartige,gewaltige ... (mehr Superlative fallen mir nicht ein) ""Many Rivers To Cross"",im Original ein eher unscheinbares Liedchen des Reggae-Sängers Jimmy Cliff,aus dem die Animals eine Ballade der ganz besonderen Art gemacht haben. 5 Jahre später gab es auch ein Cover von Joe Cocker,sicher von hohem Niveau,da dieser auch eine Super-Bluesstimme hat,bestimmt abgekupfert von der Animals-Version,aber erreicht diese keinesfalls. Eric Burdon schraubt seine Stimme in Höhen wie seit ""House Of The Rising Sun"" wahrscheinlich nicht mehr,die Hammond-Orgel von Keyborder Alan Price bringt eis- und herzenschmelzende Klänge hervor,das ganze geht an`s Herz - Gefühl pur. Man fragt sich heute noch,warunm dieses Lied nicht als Single ausgekoppelt wurde - es hätte ein Hit werden können. Fazit - eine Scheibe voll von tollen Blues-Stücken.Wenn diese Platte auch heute kaum jemand kennt und sie auch 1977 nichts riss - das ändert nichts an der Qualität. Nicht immer muß eine gute Platte ein Hit werden - umgekehrt gibt es viel Müll,der sich trotzdem gut verkauft.Dann doch lieber so eine Platte !!!"
1,"Als ich Im ""Klappentext"" was von ""Bob wird ins all geschossen"" las, hab ich doch sehr gelacht. Ich erwartete einen weinenden und um hilfe schreienden Bob, einen bis zum Wahnsinn besorgten Peter und einen ratlosen Justus. Doch was für eine Enttäuschung!!! Ich muss mich anschließen: wirklich eine der schlechtesten Folgen. Ein wahres Kammerspiel ohne Höhepunkte und voller peinlicher Computerspiel Namen. Einfach sehr unglaubwürdig. Zusätzlich möchte ich anmerken, das die Folge viel zu lang ist. Erstaunlich, das man eine inhaltslose Geschichte so in die Länge ziehen kann."
5,"Ich kann allen, die Josh schon bei Ally McBeal gesehen haben, oder sogar schon die erste CD (Josh groban) haben, diese, neue CD wirklich nur wärmstens empfehlen! Selbst die Leute, die ihn nicht kennen, werden ihn lieben, mit Sicherheit! Josh geht bei dieser CD eine ganz neue Richtung, behält aber seine Art und seinen Stil. Viele der Lieder sind nicht Englisch, er singt auf Italienisch, Spanisch und sogar Französisch! Auch sind seine Lieder mehr rockiger, wie z.b. ""All improvviso amore"" Auch Joshua Bell, der ihn mit seinem phantastischen Geigenspiel unterstützt und Deep Forest, die ihn bei ""Never let go"" unterstützen, tragen zu einem großen Teil dazu bei, dass diese CD etwas ganz besonderes ist. Und wer immer noch nicht ganz überzeugt ist, dem kann ich nur raten KAUFEN!"
1,"Ich kann nur wiederholen, was andere schon geschrieben habe, kanns aber trotzdem nicht unterlassen: Die Melodien klingen alle wie schon mal gehört - ist teilweise richtig peinlich. Die Texte sind langatmig und teilweise recht phrasenhaft. Die Orchstrierung ist mir meist zu schwülstig. Außerdem finde ich generell, dass Reinhard in der Rolle als großer Ankläger nicht seine Stärken hat (auch auf den früheren Platten nicht). Seine Stärke ist - wenn überhaupt - die subtile Kritik oder - vielmehr - die bildhafte und kunstvolle Skizzierung einer Gegenwelt."
5,"Für mich nach wie vor eine der besten Live-Aufnahmen von Reinhard Mey! Hier paßt alles zusammen: die Liedauswahl, die Zusammenstellung, die Zwischentexte. Mey voller Tatendrang und Lebensfreude, Witz und Humor, Sensibilität und ungekünstelten Ansagen zu seinen Liedern mit eingängigen und trotzdem tiefgehenden Texten und Melodien. Er ist sich selbst bewußt, aber nie selbstverliebt und immer eins mit seinem Publikum. Ein begnadeter Liedermacher singt alleine auf der Bühne nur mit Gitarre zwanzig Drei-Minuten-Geschichten. Mey aus einem Guß eben."
5,"Diese Single ist Bestandteil einer 18-Teiligen Sammlerbox für Elvis-Fans. Das schöne ist, daß die CDs wie Mini-Schallplatten aussehen und auch die Papphülle dementsprechend aufgebaut ist. Die Tonqualität ist erstaunlich gut. Zusätzlich zu der LP üblichen B-Seite gibt es noch einen Bonustrack. Also zuschlagen und sammeln. Wertsteigerung garantiert."
1,"man kann die CD maximal 10min hören, dann fängt man an zu gähnen..einfach zu ruhig und zu gleichklingend. hätte mir bei all den hype um joss stone mehr vom debüt erhofft. schade"
5,"Dies ist das erste Album der beiden Newcomer aus den Dolomiten,und sie stehen den anderen großen Volksmusikstar im keinstem hinterher. Die einfühlsamen Lieder und Texte lassen einen von Ihrer Heimat träumen. Besonders der erste Titel "" Allein in der Einsamkeit"", wie auch das Album heißt, geht einem sofort unter die Haut, nicht zuletzt durch die markante Stimme des Sängers. Ich kann nur dieses Album jedem empfehlen, der auch Künstler wie Oswald Sattler oder Kastelruther Spatzen gerne hört."
2,"Als ich die CD sah, war ich geblendet von den großen Namen die bei der Produktion beteiligt waren.  ""Geblendet"" ist auch der richtige Ausdruck, denn was ich dann zu hören bekam, war simpelster Haudrauf Metal! Der Sound ist gut (deshalb auch 2 Sterne)und erfüllt alle Kriterien einer guten Metalscheibe, aber das Songwriting und die Umsetzung der Songs ist mehr als schlecht. Wenn dieses stumpfe Riffgehacke ohne vernüftige im Ohr hängen bleibende Melodielinien moderner Metal sein soll, dann Gute Nacht Marie...  Und dann der Sänger: Jürgen Wulfes ist ein Hardrocksänger vor dem Herren, dass hat er bei CHOLANE und MOON DOC mehrfach bewiesen. Aber was soll das hier sein. Der Mann ist nun mal kein Metal-Sänger (und wird es auch nie werden). Dieses ""zusammenhanglose Geschreie"" ist genau so grottenschlecht wie das gesamte Songwriting. Damit hat sich Herr Wulfes ganz bestimmt keinen Gefallen getan... Man sollte mal aufhören jedes Doppelbass-Gekloppe und Riffgehacke als modernen zeitgemäßen Metal zu verkaufen. Es ist auch vollkommen egal wieviele bekannte Leute daran mitwirken - Scheiße kann man nicht pollieren! Wenn ihr mal eine richtig geile Oldschool Metalscheibe hören wollt, dann werft mal ein Ohr auf die neue CANNON ""Metal Style""..."
2,"Gewiss geherschen die Jungs von CUSTARD ihre Instrumente, doch was sie bieten hebt sich kaum, bis gar nicht von den Bands ab, die sie zu bewundern scheinen : EDGUY, HELLOWEEN, GAMMA RAY, ... Ich würde sogar behaupten, dass sie eine blasse Kopie dieser Bands sind."
1,"dieses Album ist nicht gut! Tut mir ja wirklich leid, aber ich habe genug von allen Within Temptations, Edenbridges, Xandrias, Leaves Eyes und Epicas! Sie sind alle drastisch schlechter als Nightwish und ich hoffe das war die letzte Fehlinvestition die ich getätigt habe. Keine Sängerin kommt auch nur annähernd an Tarja heran und kein Songschreiber besitzt die Qualität, Inspiration und vor allem das virtuose Können von Tuomas. Zwei halbwegs gute Songs reichen mir nicht! Ich will unterhalten werden und mich nicht langweilen um dann noch milde Worte für diesen Sch*** zu suchen. Genau wie bei Sharon den Adel geht mir die Stimme von Sängerin Edelsbacher bereits nach drei Songs gewaltig auf die Nerven und es muss einfach gesagt werden: Sie besitzt nicht das nötige Stimmvolumen um sauber rüberzukommen. Nein, ich will nicht mehr... Lasst mich alle in Ruhe... muss aufhören... habe Kontrolle verloren ..."
5,"Bei kaum einer Band ist es so schwierig das beste Album zu benennen wie bei den Krefelder-Bombastmetaller Blind Guardian. Die 4 Ausnahme Musiker haben kein einziges ""schlechtes"" Album rausgebracht. Was sie jedoch bei IftoS auf eine CD gezaubert haben ist atemberaubend. Es gibt wirklich KEINE einzige Schwachstelle auf diesem Album. I. Imaginations from the other Side: Schon der erste Song (und gleichzeitig Titeltrack) macht klar, wo es lang geht. Power Metal zum feinsten. Dieses Lied ist stets einer der Höhepunkte auf BG-Konzerten, da man einfach wunderbar mitgrölen kann. II. I'm Alive: Auch dies ist ein extrem intensives Lied, bei dem einmal mehr aufgezeigt wird, dass Hansi Kürsch einer der wohl besten Metal-Sänger des Genres ist. III. A Past and Future Secret: Grandiose Gänsehautballade, die einem wie auch der legendären Bard's Song fast Tränen in die Augen treibt. IV. The Script for my Requiem: Mein Lieblingslied, also der Song ist einfach nur perfekt, mehr gibts dazu nicht zu sagen. V. Mordred's Song: Beginnt ruhig steigert sich dann jedoch auch in den Bombast, auch dieser Song besitzt einen verdammt nochmal genialen Refrain und handelt wie auch A Past and Future Secret (König Arthus) und The Script for my Requiem (Die ""heiligen"" Kreuzzüge) vom 2. Lieblingsthema der 4 Barden (nach Herr der Ringe): dem Mittelalter. VI. Born in a Mourning Hall: Der schnellste Song des Albus absolut super zum bangen. Dieser Song fällt vorallem durch seinen wunderbar gesellschaftskritischen Text auf. VII. Der Song rockt wie Sau. Absolut Genial! Punkt VIII. Another Holy War: Naja durchschnittlicher Song, aber trotzdem ausgezeichnet (Naja dieser Song wirkt natürlich nach den vorher genannten Übernummern etwas mittelmäßig, aber das ist er nicht) IX. And the Story Ends: Wie der Name schon sagt beendet dieser epische Song das Album und wird auch meißtens gegen Ende von Live Gigs gerne gespielt."
1,"Wenn man in einem durch die CD hört kommt man auf diesen Gedanken, so düster sind die Texte! Kein Vergleich zu den ersten 3 CDs. Mal ab und zu ein Lied wie ""Die Braut"", das wirklich sehr gut ist, aber im Zusammenhang mit der ganzen CD fällt das Lied auch nicht besonders auf. Und irgendwie hört sich jedes Lied gleich an und das nicht nur wegen Texten. Mir fehlt einfach das lustige Element in den Liedern, was gut zu dieser Art Musik passen kann. Mein Vorschlag: Einfach den Namen ändern, dann wissen alle das es nicht mehr Schandmaul ist. Mir würde auch ein passender Name einfallen: Subway to Schandmaul. Der paßt wie die Faust aufs Auge!"
5,"Ich kam damals in den Genuss des Livekonzerts, da ich damals noch in der Stätte wo sie aufgetreten sind gearbeitet habe. Und ich muss sagen: Absolut phantastisch, einmalig, hinreissend, bezaubernd und mit solch gigantischen Stimmen, ..."
1,"Ausser den stümperhaften Titel-Übersetzungen und ein paar 20 Jahre alten deutschen Song-Versionen ist nichts deutsch auf dieser ""Deutschen Version"", nicht mal Übersetzungen der Texte oder wenigstens Originaltexte liegen bei. Ein klarer Fall von Schwindel... so klar, dass mein Musikladen die zuhause bereits geöffnete und durchgehörte CD ohne Probleme zurücknahm. Tja, von einem enttäuschten Gabriel-Fan gäbe es eigentlich 5 Minussterne hier - wenn's möglich wäre. Pfui!"
1,"Nach 3121 konnt man viel erwarten: kräftigen Funk im modernen Sound. Aber diese Album klingt wie eine Probe-Aufnahme verwaschen und lieblos produziert. Auch die Auswahl der Instrumente, selbst die Gitarren-Sounds sind ohne Inspiration, teils schwer erträglich. Die Balladen habe ich schon viele Male von Prince besser gehört, was er als Rock-Nummer beabsichtigt hat erscheint wie eine Karrikatur. Das fehlende Booklet ist nicht zu entschuldigen, selbst die Titel-Namen fehlen! Dieses Album ist überflüssig, ein Tiefpunkt."
5,"""Hurricane Bar"" ist ein überaus tanzbares Punk-Rock Album, da sich neben brillantem Schlagzeugspiel und harten Riffs in fast alles Liedern auch der Twist versteckt. Dazu kommen knackige Texte, die rührend poetisch (z.B. ""Ringing Bells"" und ""All my Senses"") oder auch provokativ daherkommen, wobei sie übliche Themen wie Liebe, Leid, Hass behandeln.  Der wohl bekannteste Song ist ""Down in the Past"", der bei jedem Live-Konzert die Menge zum pogen bringt. Aber auch zu Hause kann der einiges! Im melancholisch-düsteren ""Added Family"" lassen sich ganz klar die schwedischen Wurzeln der Fünf erkennen.  Dieses Album hat musikalisch wirklich alles, was das Herz begehrt. Und zudem ein cooles Booklet, mit vielen Schwarz/Weiß-Fotos und allen Songtexten. Kann ich nur empfehlen!!"
1,"Bin absolut enttäuscht von dieser CD...Als alter House Club Hottest Fan habe ich mir diesen (angeblichen) Nachfolger in der Hoffnung gekauft, eine hochwertige, liebevoll produzierte House CD zu bekommen wie ich es von der HCH Reihe gewohnt bin. Aber das ging leider derbe nach hinten los. Die meisten tracks sind uralt (wenn auch teilw. in neuen mixen) und im Aufbau fehlt mir jegliche ""Spannung"" oder ""Mitnahme""...leider nur 1 Stern von mir!"
5,"An Everlast habe ich zwei Erinnerungen.Einmal als Kopf von House of Pain Anfang der 90s und natürlich sein Solo-Charterfolg mit ""What its like"" am Ende des letzten Jahrzehnts. Dann hatte ich mit seiner Musik nichts mehr zu tun. In meinen Augen war es ein klassischer Verlauf vom harten, provozierenden Gangster zum ruhigen, besonnenen Gitarrenspieler. Doch mit seinem aktuellen Album hat er es doch tatsächlich geschafft, beide Zeiten zu vereinen und so eine einmalige 17-Tracks-andauernde Atmosphäre zu schaffen, die ich nicht erwartet hätte. Er ist wieder laut (vielleicht war er nie leise?),voller politischer Parolen, ruft zum Sturz des Kaisers, zur Revolution auf und kritisiert bestehende Systeme. Aber er ist auch leise und nachdenklich, setzt sich mit Freundschaft, Liebe, Verrat und Schmerz auseinander. Kann dieser Mix überhaupt funktionieren?  Bei mir hat es das auf jeden Fall-denn jedes einzelne Wort ist so überzeugend, authentisch und erwachsen rübergebracht, dass ich mich geärgert habe, dem Mann nicht schon bei einem seiner letzten Alben eine Chance gegeben zuhaben.Bei seinem nächsten Werk bin ich dann gleich dabei! Anspieltipps:Das geniale Johnny Cash-Cover ""Folsom Prison Blues"", ""Throw a Stone"" (der beste Skit, den ich in den letzten Jahren gehört habe) &amp; ""Kill the Emperor"""
5,"Mit ""cheesy"", ""schmalzig"" wurde das Album in den USA meistens bewertet - und ich schließe mich dem an. Aber was erwartet man, wenn Alice sich auf die Schnelle mit zwar ordentlichen Musikern zusammentut, diese aber allesamt keine genialen Songschreiber sind? Die Reminiszenzen an seine alten Alben sind nett, aber ein musikalisches Gesamtkonzept wie auf den vorigen Alben oder gar den 70er LPs vermißt man schmerzlich. Hymnen und Ohrwürmer gibt's schon gar nicht. Auch stimmlich wäre etwas mehr Variabilität schön gewesen. Kann es sein, daß hier schnell ein Album zur Vertragserfüllung zusammengeschustert wurde? Immerhin erscheint Alice, trotz des vielversprechenden Titels, nicht in seinem klassischen ""Pierrot""-Grusel-Make-Up, sondern mit ""Clockwork-Orange""-Mascara im Spider-Stil. Vielleicht war's ihm einfach peinlich: Immer dann nämlich, wenn er sein ihm später von der ""Krähe"" geklautes Make-Up auflegte, kam ein Mordskracher und Riesenerfolg raus. Aber das da... Wer weiß, ob Alice nochmal eine Scheibe veröffentlicht - deshalb aus alter Liebe 5 Sterne, trotz alledem, wie immer! And remember the Coop!"
5,"Eine düstere Mischung... Romantische Lieder, gefolgt von harten Bekenntnissen. TIPP: ""Life will never be the same again"" Ein zum Nachdenken anregendes Lied. Eine CD die zeigt, dass gute Musik auch aus Österreich kommen kann!"
1,"Ich bin ein großer Fan von der Buddha Bar CD-Reihe und habe mir bisher fast alle CDs gekauft. Jedoch ist die Ocean-Ausgabe nicht einmal Mittelmaß. Nur dahin plätschernde Wischi-Waschi-Musik, kaum ein Thema, dass im Ohr hängenbleibt - reine Fahrstuhlmusik - für mich eine große Entäuschung."
2,"Wishbone Ash in der heutigen Zeit ist wie Uwe Seeler im Fussball. Uwe war gut, ist es heute aber nicht mehr. Wishbone Ash war auch gut"
5,"Von Jugend an höre ich gerne die Musik der ""alten Crooner"" wie Dean Martin oder Frank Sinatra. Als ich die Doppel-CD ""The Crooners"" kaufte, war ich über den Verdacht, ein Helmut Lotti-Fan zu sein, völlig erhaben - mich hat einfach die Songauswahl auf CD 1 angesprochen. Ich habe mir also die CD angehört, ich habe verglichen und war positiv überrascht. Helmut Lotti interpretiert die Songs mit seiner angenehmen, warmen Stimme sehr einfühlsam - und dass er singen kann, wird wohl niemand mit halbwegs funktionierendem Gehör in Abrede stellen. An den Arrangements und dem  Orchester gibt es ebenfalls nichts zu mäkeln. Sicherlich klingt Helmut Lotti nicht genauso wie Perry Como, Dean Martin oder gar Louis Armstrong - aber warum sollte er auch? Warum sollte nicht jemand nach 50 Jahren diese Songs auf seine eigene Art singen dürfen - wir haben ja schließlich die klassische Musik auch nicht mit den Komponisten begraben. Vollends überzeugt hat mich die zweite CD mit den selbst geschriebenen Songs von H. Lotti. So mancher dieser Titel hätte wohl zu Zeiten der ""originalen"" Crooner das Zeug zum Hit gehabt - schade, dass der musikalische Zeitgeist heute ein anderer ist... Insgesamt ein sowohl sehr swingendes, als auch romantisches Album, das einfach Spaß macht. Und da wir hier nur das Album und nicht eine Person, ein Marketingkonzept oder die Optik oder Choreographie bei Fernseh/ Bühnenauftritten bewerten, kann ich eigentlich nur 5 Sterne geben! (Sorry, aber diese Bemerkung zu einigen der vorliegenden Rezensionen konnte ich mir nicht verkneifen!)"
5,"wunderbahre, sehr empfehlenswerte best of des texanischen saitenhexers, der leider 1990 viel zu früh von uns ging. die cd enthält die bekanntesten songs seiner karriere. von den alben ""texas flood"" - ""In step"" tracklist: 1. pride and joy + 2. mary had a little lamb + 3. texas flood + 4. rude mood + 5. couldn`t stand the weather * 6. cold shot * 7. the things (that) I used to do * 8. tin pan alley * 9. say what! # 10. change it # 11. come on (part. III) # 12. life without you # 13. the house is rockin` ° 14. crossfire ° 15. tightrope ° 16. the sky is crying (live at carnegie hall 1984) + - from TEXAS FLOOD (1983) * - from COULDNT STAND THE WEATHER (1984) # - from SOUL TO SOUL (1985) ° - from IN STEP (1989)"
2,"Hat Eric Clapton mit zunehmendem Alter immer mehr seine Neigung zu...na ja sagen wir mal...eher introvertierten Alben ausgelebt, so ist das neueste Werk von ihm schlicht und einfach einschläfernd. Sämtliche Lieder mäandern irgendwo zwischen Pop und Easy-Blues umher und könnten auch von Chris de Burgh stammen. Erschütternd schlechtes Werk des Altmeisters, dem doch znehmend die Ideen auszugehen scheinen."
5,"Rose Tattoo haben von '81 bis '84 oder so drei Spitzenalben veröffentlicht, sind dann nach weniger tollen Werken in der Versenkung verschwunden und bis 2000 nur ab und zu wieder aufgetaucht. Dann plötzlich knallen sie uns ein Live-Album vor den Latz, schieben 2002 ein echt frisches Studioalbum nach und steigern sich 2007 nochmal mit dem vorliegenden Album. Ich steh ja auf AC/DC, aber so frisch wie die Tatts hier (mittlerweile leider ohne den verstorbenen Pete Wells) haben die großen Brüder das letzte mal 1981 geklungen. Ich zerpflücke die Scheibe jetzt nicht in die einzelnen Songs, das Album hat ohnedies keinen Durchhänger.  Wer's nicht kennt, der Sound ist ähnlich wie die alten AC/DC, bloß mit einer Slidegitarre und einem Sänger, der herrlich ausdrucksstark brüllt und stimmlich weitaus näher an Bon Scott als an Brian Johnson liegt. Die ganze Platte röhrt, kracht und wirbelt von vorne bis hinten, fährt wirklich guten, schnellen Rock'n'Roll; schärfer als AC/DC, aber nicht so wild wie Motörhead. Kleine stilistische Ausreißer sind etwa ""City blues"", das sehr langsam und entspannt klingt, mit einem Sound wie in einer leeren Konzerthalle oder ""Sweet meat"" mit schleppendem Groove. Einer meiner Lieblingssongs, den ich vielleicht hervorheben möchte, ist ""Once in a lifetime"", gewidmet dem guten alten Slidegitarristen Pete Wells, der sich leider schon auf seinen letzten Weg gemacht hat. Bei einem Tatts-Konzert in einem kleinen Club stand Angry Anderson während dieses Songs nach dem letzten ""It's time to let you go"" zwei Minuten lang mit geschlossenen Augen und hochgereckter Faust wortlos da, während rundherum die Gitarristen und der Schlagzeuger dem Ex-Mitstreiter furiosen Tribut zollten. Dann hat der Hüne von Bassist den 1,50m-Sänger noch kurz tröstend an die Brust gedrückt. Keine Erklärung für Publikum nötig, einfach schön. Tolle Band, tolles Album. Kann nur die Höchstnote geben."
4,"The latest from Hensley, an ex-UH keyboardist, features all the Greatest Hits listing of the famed band. What's more important, those are totally new arrangements. The songs are given fresh dimention and vision. Since Ken found it hard to impress the West with his heavy ballad rock tradition, he wisely decided to record and produce this album completely in Russia, and that ""trick"" has worked out well. The resulting sound is unique in its ""removed"" laid-back nature. It helps to underline Hensley's own part. The entire thing resembles early work by Asia. The production is neat, and only the somewhat shabby booklet betrays this was actually Russia."
1,"Über dieses musikalische Machwerk braucht man nicht lange zu diskutieren. Es ist dermaßen schlecht wie überflüssig, dass es schon verwundert...Nr. 1 in Deutschland. Aber das haben ja die letzten Jahre gezeigt, Qualität ist nicht mehr der Garant für Erfolg im Popbuis. Gut das man in einem halben Jahr von dieser Dancecombo nix mehr hören will und sie in spätestens einem Jahr vergessen hat. Arme Musikwelt."
1,"Zugegeben, die Erwartungen waren hoch ..., durften sie aber auch nach allen bisher Veröffentlichtem sein!  Kein Track der in Erinnerung bleiben dürfte, langweilige Beats, durchsichtige Arangements, kein Groove geschweige Dub und absolut durchschnittliche Kompositionen, die keine Maßstäbe mehr zu setzen vermögen. Alles in allem sehr enttäuschend, eben massiver Mist!"
5,"Ich weiss nicht wie ich auf diese beiden gekommen bin, aber ich kann nur eines zu dieser Platte sagen: KAUFEN!!!"
5,"End of green ist das Sicherheitsnetz verzweifelter Seelen. Keine andere Band schafft es mit einem wahre Melancholie zu teilen und somit wieder Hoffnung zu schenken. Dies ist das erste Werk der damals noch 4 Göppinger und wie ein ungeschliffener Diamant. Dieses Album vereint bereits alles , was End of green ausmacht, drückt die Melancholie noch viel direkter aus als die Nachfolger, erreicht aber noch nicht in allen Songs die selbe musikalische Reife. Dies drückt sich in den Songs ""You"" und ""no more pleasure"" aus. Alle anderen Songs sind bärenstark und strotzen von einer Klasse, welche die meisten Bands nie erreichen . Obwohl es schwer fällt auf diesem Niveau zu differieren sind die Evergreens ""Infinity"" und ""Away"" nochmals hervorzuheben. Diese Songs müssen sich einfach, insbesonders jedem Gothic-Metal Fan an den Gehöhrgang schmiegen."
2,"Was für eine Scheibe, was für ein Skandal. Mit Black Metal hat das wahrlich nichts mehr zu tun. Gut, das Prädikat 'Melodic' passt hingegen wieder. Denn jeder Titel dieser CD wird bis zur letzten Sekunde mit schwammig-verkitschter Synthie-Mucke zugekleistert. Dagegen kann auch der Sänger nicht anschreien. Somit verkommt Track für Track zur Begleitmusik, die für jeden x-beliebigen Rosamunde Pilcher Film geeignet wäre. Mehr Weichspülung ist kaum noch möglich. Igitt!"
1,"Der Black Metal Markt ist total überflutet, genauso wie damals der Death Metal Markt. Die meisten Veröffentlichungen sind langweilig und bieten nichts neues, so wie nun auch diese Band. Kauft euch lieber ein Paar alte Highlights... Nicht zu empfehlen!"
4,"Jaja, die Liebe hat viele Facetten. And One beglücken den Fan mit drei prall gefüllten Maxi-CDs, die mit dem sehr effektvollen Cover ein schönes Sammlerstück darstellen. Zum Titelsong muß man nicht viel sagen: AND ONE - wie man es mag und hören will. Schelmische Texte die aufgrund Ihrer eindeutigen Zweideutigkeit leicht unter die Gürtellinie ziehen und Steves charismatischer Gesang machen die Liebe fast perfekt, wenn da nicht die Live-Aufnahmen wären, die eigentlich viel zu sehr nach Konserve klingen und auf Dauer gesanglich schon fast nerven, denn es ist nicht wahrhaft Liebe, wenn man die eigenen Songs so zerstört, aber dennoch kann man sich sich einem starken Gefühl der Zuneigung nicht verwehren."
5,"Das beste, was meine Ohren seit langen zu hören bekommen haben. Einfach beeindruckend, was die Briten mit ihrem neuem Longplayer bieten. Abwechslungsreicher elektronischer Pop irgendwo zwischen Depeche Mode und Nine Inch Nails. Wer die alten Platten mag, wird diese geradezu vergöttern. Eine derartige Verbesserung und Weiterentwicklung hab ich bisher noch nie erlebt. Sie klingen nicht wirklich anders. Doch sind auf dieser CD fast nur excellente Lieder á la ""It scares me"" und das macht den Unterschied. Die optimal abgemischten Rythmen, die nur selten technoid sind, werden umhüllt von der eingängigen Stimme Marks und eines teilweise düster wirkenden Klangerüsts, in dem auch ab und zu mal Gitarren angenehm aufblitzen. Mein Vorschlag: Kaufen! Anspieltips: eigentlich das ganze Album, mein Lieblingstitel ist ""I can't imagine how it hurts""."
1,"Na ja ist ja ein schöner Versuch aber wie sagt man so schön Schuster bleib bei Deinen Leisten. Country Musik ist und bleibt Country Musik und bitte nicht so etwas, genauso wie Tom Astor usw. Country Musik hat ihre Wurzeln in Amerika/Canada und nicht verdeutschen oder Pop Songs auf Country machen.Die Profis in USA/Canada können das besser."
2,"Das erste Album war halt echt ein Hammer mit vielen coolen 2 Step Songs, schönen Balladen und Dancekrachern, das zweite Album war schon ein kleiner Rückschritt und jetzt rutscht Mr. David auf einer Schmalzwelle aus und kommt davon nicht weg. Es gibt nur ein paar annehmbare Songs auf dem Album wie z.B. ""Hypnotic"" oder ""Just chillin'"" (deswegen zwei Sterne!), der Rest ist langweilig, fast alles balladesk und mit schnulzigen Refrains, die nicht wirklich zünden, die Stimme ist so auch nicht mehr so eingängig wie früher. Oh je, ich kann leider nicht einmal mehr 3 Punkte geben, da ich die CD sicherlich nicht sehr oft hören werden. Schade!"
5,"""Slicker than your Average"" ist wirklich super - eigentlich ohne Worte. Craig David ist ein richtiges Multitalent! Das Album ist einfach genial und absolut zeitgemäß. Unbedingt kaufen! Jeder Titel ist einzigartig!"
5,Also mal ehrlich konnte sich jemals jemand die Hosen in ruhiger Fassung vorstellen??? Also ich konnte es bis vor zwei Jahren auch nicht^^ Aber dieses Album hat alles was man sich von den Hosen wünschen kann... nur eben leise. Muss echt sagen das ich mer als positiv überascht war von diesem Album!!! Es ist auf jeden Fall Kaufenswert und sollte in keiner Hosen Sammlung fehlen^^
2,"Zufällig habe ich im Radio ""Wie der Hirsch schreit"" gehört und war begeistert. Umso enttäuschter war ich von der Aufnahme dieses Werkes durch den Carus Verlag. Künstlerisch will ich mir kein Urteil erlauben - die Aufnahmequalität ist allerdings nur als amateurhaft zu beschreiben. Hall und Dumpfheit der Vorführung in einer Kirche hört man der Aufnahme deutlich an. Der Chor - schließlich ist es ein Chorwerk - verblasst hinter den Instrumenten. Die Textverständlichkeit leidet sehr unter beiden Einschränkungen. Dynamikpassagen klingen metallern. Die DDD Aufnahme- und Reproduktionstechnik hinterlässt einen seelenlosen Brei. Schade."
2,"""Ich bin so dankbar, dass es einen Donizetti und einen Bellini gegeben &gt; hat"", bekennt sie, ""das ist meine Musik, das ist mein Fach."" Doch Bellinis &gt; Norma, eine Bravourpartie, lehnt sie ab: ""Norma ist nicht meine Stimme, &gt; allein vom Timbre her. Aber ich habe auch zu viel Ehrfurcht vor dieser &gt; Oper, mit der die Callas so berühmt geworden ist. Norma ist ihre Partie &gt; gewesen. Sie ist für mich ein Heiligenbild. Das rühr ich nicht an."" &gt; &gt; --- Edita Gruberova, Die Welt, 22. Februar 2001"
1,"Also ich fand das Album The better Life viel besser.Da war Pfeffer drin.Im neuen Album ""Far away the Sun"" klingen 3 Doors down wie Schmuserocker.Bin total enttäuscht gewesen.Ich kann das Album nicht weiterempfehlen"
5,"Mal ganz abgesehen davon, dass nur zehn Tracks, d.h. nur 40 Minuten auf dem Silberling sind, ein wirklich hörenswertes Werk. Dreht man seine Anlage aber voll auf, könnte es Probleme mit den Nachbarn geben. Laute Gitarren und die dunkle Stimme von Leader Chad, bearbeiten mit eingängigen Melodien und beklemmenden Texten das Trommelfell. Meine persönlichen Empfehlungen sind Songs, wie Never Again oder Money Bought. Man hört, dass die Musik hier zur Therapie wird, für Band und Hörer gleichermaßen. Wenn euch also mal wieder alles ankotzt, bei dieser Scheibe kann man sich so richtig abreagieren, und am liebsten würde man selbst, wie Sänger Chad losbrüllen. Nur ist es unwahrscheinlich, dass es jemand so voller Zorn und gleichzeitig mit so viel Gefühl rüberbringt."
2,"Da hätte ich mir als Danko Jones Fan doch etwas mehr erwartet. Vom harten Rock ist da doch nicht so viel übrig geblieben. Klingt wie die Vorredner schon geschrieben haben ""weichgespült"", auch der Begriff ""College-Rock"" trifft es da wohl tatsächlich. Von Rock'n'Roll oder Rotz'n'Roll ist da nicht viel übrig geblieben. Ich hatte von Anfang an gedacht, dass die Scheibe etwas nach Foo Fighters klingt. Als ich hier nun gelesen habe, dass deren Produzent mitverantwortlich für das Werk ist, fühlte ich mich auch gleich mal bestätigt und musste doch innerlich schmunzeln.  Der Sound der Lieder gefällt mir auch nicht wirklich, die Bass-Drum ist irgenwie etwas übersteuert, noch schlimmer finde ich die Gitarren. Die klingen wirklich absolut künstlich und synthetisch. Das ganze Album klingt auch weniger wie ein gutes, handgemachtes Proberaum-Album, sondern mehr wie ein reines Studioalbum. Irgendwie leblos und langweilig. Ein paar mittelprächtige Lieder sind schon dabei, deswegen auch 2 Sterne statt nur einem Stern. Aber ich habe auch die Ausgabe mit den beiden Bonus-Tracks. Ohne diese wäre meine Bewertung wohl noch schlechter geworden. Fazit: Wenn man die älteren Danko-Alben mag, lieber Finger weg."
2,"... die Scheibe ist eine absolute Enttäuschung, sofern man eine ""Danko Jones"" Platte erwartet hat. Natürlich wird hier ordenlicher Rock gespielt und auch die Produktion läßt keine Wünsche übrig. Aber eben Durchschnittsware. Und das ist definitiv zu wenig. Ebenfalls ärgerlich, daß groß und breit John Garcia als Gast angekündigt wurde und eben dieser mit leider nur einer Textzeile (ok, er wiederholt sie mehrfach) vertreten ist. Was soll das denn? Als Fan von J. G. fühlt man sich hier hinterŽs Licht geführt. Somit, dies ist keine Platte für Danko Jones Fans der ersten Stunde und deshalb rate ich von einem Kauf ab."
1,"einfach nur lächerlich wie Avril Lavigne versucht ein ""bad girl-image"" aufzubauen."
5,"Wer den Klaus Schulze der 70er und 80er Jahre mag, kommt bei diesem Album voll auf seine Kosten. Sehr guter minimalistischer Synthesizer Sound - einfach der klassische Klaus Schulze."
5,"Nach einem kurzen Ausflug in Gefilde, in denen sich Clueso offenbar nicht so übertrieben wohl gefühlt hat (Text und Ton), knüpft dieses Album mehr oder weniger nahtlos an das großartige ""Gute Musik"" an. Die instrumentale Vielfalt zeugt von der Weiterentwicklung der Band, das Ensemble ist aufeinander abgestimmt wie es besser nicht sein könnte und textmäßig ist dem Jungen ja seit jeher nichts Schlechtes nachzusagen. Der erfrischend faire Preis für so ein Meisterwerk ist dann noch der Tupfen auf dem I. Ein sehr großes I, wie ich meine! 5 Sterne mit einem großen I - oder einer astreinen römischen 1!"
2,"Ein Album, das an Weihnachten viele Abnehmer gefunden hätte, wenn es nicht zur Sommerzeit erschienen wäre. Noch dazu ein etwas schwierig zu händelndes, weil überproduziertes Comebackwerk, das ich in keinster Weise despektierlich bewerten möchte, mir aber leider nichts anderes übrig bleibt, als dieses Album als ""nur nett"" zu bezeichnen. Die Instrumentierung ist bisweilen zu aufdringlich, dass so -ich nennen sie mal- ""zurückhaltende"" Stimmen wie die von Jessica grob übertönt werden (""I believe in you"", diese Pianohook ist mehr als laut). Nur Sandy kann dagegen an, weil sie jenseits von Gut und Bösen in den höchsten Tönen pfiebt. Des Weiteren fehlen den an sich guten Titeln wie ""Been here before"" und ""Back off"" (die Sirenen, meine Lieben!) der genügende Dreck im Stimmen-Arrangement (besonders bei der Titelzeile des erstgenannten Liedes), den früher Vanessa so gut mitgebracht hatte. Klingt unfair, ist aber leider so, Ladys. Dann haben wir noch nette Pop/Rock-Ballädchen wie ""Amaze me"", ""Make a change"" (wundervoller ""Another day in paradise""- Pathos), ""What if"" (zuviel Drums, man kanns auch übertreiben), ""I don't wanna talk about it"", ""Misguided heart"" (das Lied gibt's mit Beethovens ""Mondscheinsonate"" als Untermalung schon 1000mal besser von En Vogue und heißt ""Love won't let me out""), die da herrlich dahin plätschern, aber nicht wirklich hängen bleiben oder einen bei den viel zitierten, bei mir allerdings nicht vorhandenen, Eier packen. Und auch nett, dass bei jeder sich bietenden Gelegenheit (ProSieben-Special, TV Total...) auf ""Maybe"" aufmerksam gemacht. Müsste ja mit dem Teufel zugehen, wenn dieser noch billigere ""Goodbye to yesterday""- Abklatsch NICHT die nächste Single wird! Die ganze Uninspiriertheit der Popkunst wird dann auf ""I had a feeling"" ausgepackt mit Glockenspiel, Mundharmonika-Schleife und vermeidlichem triphoppigem 80er-Flippers-Schlagzeug. ""A reason"" tutet noch mal in das ""Goodbye to yesterday""/""Maybe""- Horn und zum tränenreichen Abschluss noch ein ""The reason""-Abklatsch (also, das letzte Lied bevor sie das erste Mal aufhörten) durch ""The rhythm of my heart"" mit Piano, fetten Streichern und trauertrunkener, aber dennoch so großer, inbrünstiger Glückseligkeit, wie ich sie das letzte Mal von - würg- Hartmut Engler bei PURs ""Geweint vor Glück"" gehört habe.  Ich halte jetzt für mich fest: Die erste Scheibe ""Elle'ment"" war nett, die zweite ""Now...us!"" war super, das Swing-Album war überragend, auf der vierten ""Pure"" gab's nur noch vier, fünf überzeugende Stücke und hier nur noch zwei, drei ""ganz nette"". Fazit: Das Comeback hätte nicht sein müssen, da sie sich nix Neues haben einfallen lassen. Jedenfalls ist dies hier keine Scheibe, an die man sich noch in zehn Jahren erinnern wird."
2,"Nach Ihre 1.Solosingel die ja eher schneller wahr,  kommt jetz ""Tell me"" eine sehr schöne Ballade die Sandy`s Stimme sehr schön zur geltung kommt.Aber jetz kommt das grösse aber und dafür gibt es von mir nur 2Sterne der Song ist nicht besonders und mir fehlt so das inovative, und Sandy geht bei Ihren Songs immer auf nummer sicher das kann in Deutschland klappen muss aber nicht und wenn man sich die Charts ansieht regieren andere und keine POPSTARS und Konsorten.Klar die No Angels haben noch super viele Fans aber das reicht auch nicht mehr um dauerhaft TOP zu sein.Mein Fazit netter Song nur mal wieder nichts riskiert und wieder mal POP eingesestz das,zur zeit total aout ist!!!!"
5,"Mir ging es wie einigen anderen, nach dem ersten hören dachte ich, na ja ein bis zwei gute Titel den Rest kannste vergessen. Aber man sollte sich wirklich die Zeit nehmen und die CD mehrmals anhören ich bin mittlerweile überzeugt, daß diese CD das Debütalbum noch übertrifft. Die Helden haben sich echt weiterentwickelt, das merkt man besonders bei den Titeln ""Ein Elefant für Dich"" und bei ""Darf ich das behalten"". Meiner Meinung nach ein echter Volltreffer!"
2,"Um es mal so zu sagen..., schöne Stimme und gute Band aber entweder hat der Songwriter oder der Sänger selber, ein arges Problem mit Freundinnen und Exfreundinnen. Es nervt schon ein wenig das bei 70% der Titel dieser eine Aspekt beleuchtet wird, wie sch... ""Die Freundin"" war/ist. Vielleicht lernen sie ja bis zum nächsten Album, daß es jede Menge mehr gibt, über das es sich zu singen lohnt."
1,"sowas mieses habe ich schon lange nicht mehr gehört. ich mag es nicht, wenn man eine billige kopie ist. man sieht sie sich an und??? unter 1000en würde man sie nicht wiedererkennen. billige kopie von zig anderen bands und die musik??? marilyn manson für arme. wenn man fan ist, gut und schön, aber deshalb braucht man nicht den sound zu kopieren. ich sag nur billig, schlecht, die jungs und die mädels haben einfach nichts drauf! bloß nicht kaufen!!!!"
5,"Seit ich diese CD habe, muß, ja muß, ich sie mir täglich anhören. So ganz anders, als man HvG kannte, aber doch vertraut. Er hat sich einen ""langgehegten Wunsch"" erfüllt? Uns auch! Danke, Hubert!"
2,"Also ich finde ehrlich gesagt dieses Album langweilig und einfallslos, nach zwei Mal hören hattte ich genug davon und jetzt liegt die Cd irgendwo in der Ecke! Mir ist das ganze Album zu poppig, es gibt zwar auch Ausnahmen (Predictable) aber sonst war ich eben nur enttäuscht! Good Charlotte machen kommerzielle Musik, die überhaupt nichts mit Punk, wo sie von vielen eingeordnet werden, zu tun hat!"
4,"Auch ich muss zugeben, dass ich etwas geschockt auf die CD gestarrt hab, als ich sie mir zum ersten Mal angehört hab, denn bis dahin wusste ich noch nichts davon, dass Marky Chavez aufgehört hat. Nach dem ersten Schock-Moment und zwei, drei weiteren Malen anhören kann ich für meinen Teil aber nur sagen, dass Adema auf ""Planets"" zwar anders, aber nicht unbedingt schlechter klingen. Naja, höchstens ein bisschen, was aber wahrscheinlich daran liegt, dass die Tracks diesmal etwas weniger agressiv als auf ""Adema"" und ""Unstable"" klingen. Aber wie man sich schon an so viele andere Sachen gewöhnt hat, wird man sich wohl über kurz oder lang auch an Luke Caraccioli als neue Stimme von Adema gewohnen. Und vielleicht wird das nächste Album dann ja auch wieder etwas rougher... Tips: Shoot The Arrows, Barricades In Time und Vikraphone"
2,"Leider muss ich meinem Vorredner Andreas Wittenburg 100 %ig zustimmen, was mir als total begeisterter Joss-Stone-Hörer richtig schwer fällt. Die neue Scheibe hat längst nicht mehr den Charme, Schmelz und die Inspiriertheit der vorangegangenen. Bislang war Joss Stone anderen jungen Soul-Sängerinnen (wie Amy Winehouse) weit überlegen und hatte es auch nicht nötig, mit Image das Talent zu kompensieren. Diese neue CD ist langweilig. Schade."
2,"als fan der bee gees und besonders von robin gibb besuchte ich voller vorfreude das konzert in frankfurt. schon da war auffallend, dass das orchester und vor allem der schlagzeuger m.e. sehr unsensibel den gesang des künstlers nicht begleiteten sondern allzuoft übertönten. die hoffnung auf die cd, bei der man ja durchaus den mix steuern und verbessern kann, war unbegründet: ein klang-mischmasch sondergleichen..., nicht dem künstler anzukreiden, sondern einer absolut lieblosen, schlampigen produktion."
1,"privates kino scheint die wohl mit großem abstand schlechteste platte von keimzeit zu sein, die nicht davon lassen konnten, sich dankbar, aber dennoch selbstbewußt von frank plasa zu verabschieden. das hätte allen gut getan und wäre auch ein nachvollziehbarer weg gewesen. stattdessen knarzen hier unablässig die gitarren, ab und zu macht man auf elektronic; auf den vorgängern ist die rechnung aufgegangen, haben musik und sprache elektrisiert und berührt. hier hingegen erwartet einen aufgeblasene einfallslosigkeit und man gewinnt den eindruck, dass die herren aus potzdam langsam müde werden.  von 1000 leute ist diese platte meilenweit entfernt. sehr schade."
5,"Das Ereignis dieses Boris Querschnitts ist die Interpretation der Titelrolle durch Gottlob Frick. Meines Wissens hat der große Bassist diese herausfordernde Partie nie auf der Bühne gesungen, obwohl es - wie er in einem Interview sagte - ein großer Wunsch von ihm gewesen wäre. Um so wertvoller ist diese Dokumentation. Frick gestaltet den Zaren in deutscher Sprache, mit gefühlvollem Melos, fließendem Legato,balsamischer  Stimmfülle und  gewohnt hervorragender Wortverständlichkeit. Im Gegensatz zu vielen slawischen Interpreten faßt Frick den Boris nicht als tyrannischen Despoten auf. Er verzichtet bewußt auf alle dramatisierenden, oft schmierenhaft wirkenden,theatralischen Gefühlausbrüche. Frick sieht und gestaltet den Boris in erster Linie als gütigen,verzweifelten um das Wohl der Kinder und Untertanen besorgten Vater. Dadurch bekommt die Auseinandersetzung mit der eigenen Schuld in den Szenen mit seinem Sohn Feodor und im ""Tod des Boris"" zentrale Bedeutung.An manchen Stellen wird wagnerische Größe erreicht, Erinnerungen an König Markes klagenden Monolog in ""Tristan und Isolde"" werden wach. Insgesamt gelingt Frick auch als Boris ein Porträt von faszinierender  singschauspielerischer Ausdrucksintensität. Besonders spannend, das der damals noch junge Martti Talvela, der später zum  überragenden Darsteller  heranreifte in dieser Aufnahme den Pimen sang. Auch die anderen Mitwirkenden u. a. Erika Köth, Rudolf Schock, Margarethe Klose und John van Kesteren bieten hohes Niveau. Der bewährte Operndirigent Lovro von Matacic paßt sich mit seiner delikat-dezenten , fast romantischen Musizierweise perfekt an die Rollenauffassung des Hauptdarstellers an.CD ist also für alle Freunde des großen deutschen Bassisten fast ein Muß. Opernfreunde, die Aufnahmen in deutscher Sprache bevorzugen und eine Alternative zur gewohnten Theaterschablone suchen werden von dieser etwas ungewöhnlichen Boris-Aufnahme und besonders von Gottlob Frick in der Titelpartie begeistert sein."
5,"Es gibt ja Leute, die kennen von Elgar nur die hier eingespielten ""Enigma-Variationen"" und den ersten der ""Pomp and Circumstances"" Marches. Das ist zwar nicht viel, aber immerhin ein Anfang. Wenn man dann aberden Glücksgriff getan und die Aufnahme der genannten Werke mit einem der britischsten Orchester, nämlich dem der BBC, unter der Leitung des zum Einspielungsdatum nicht mehr ganz jungen Leonard Bernstein gekauft hat, dann hat man die wohl emotionalste, intensivste und persönlichste Einspielung der besagten Werke im heimischen CD-Regal stehen, die gegenwärtig man - trotz hoher Einspielungszahl auch neueren Datums - kaufen kann. Aber das ist ja beim späten Lenny quasi das interpretative Markenzeichen, das ihm oft als Exzentrizität ausgelegt wird.  Ich sehe das nicht so. Ich denke vielmehr, dass ich beispielsweise kaum jemals eine berückendere(und langsamere) Darstellung der ""Nimrod""-Variation gehört habe, ein Auffahren an Gefühl, dass es einen vor lauter Sentimentalität schlicht zerreissen möchte. Allein das lohnt die Anschaffung. Ähnlich ist's mit dem wortwörtlichen ""Pomp"" den Bernstein im ersten ""Pomp and Circumstance"" March enrfesselt. Da jubelt die ""Land of hope and glory""-Hymne gerade so, dass man - auch als Nicht-Brite - nicht nur patriotisch wird, sondern sich nach der (an der Oberfläche) guten alten Zeit des Empire zurücksehnt.  Und der Rest? Na was schon: Ein wunderbares Plädoyer für Elgar!"
1,"Es ist schon anmaßend von John Mayall, Titel von Freddie King zu interpretieren. Seine Begleitmusiker schaffen zwar ein solides Sound-Fundament, doch die dünne Stimme Mayalls klingt darüber einfach nur lächerlich. Ich besitze viele LPs und CDs von JM, aber diese ist einfach nur peinlich für den alten Herrn."
4,"Meine Vorrezensenten haben schon so einiges an dem neuen Album gelobt bzw. kritisiert. Im Folgenden möchte ich zu einigen Ansichten meine eigene hinzufügen: ""Der Opener (THE HURLYBURLY) ist albern"" Da bin ich ganz anderer Meinung. Klar, ist das kein Prog-Rock, das ist weder komplex noch irgendwie originell. Aber ich halte das Stück dennoch für einen passenden Opener. Entspannt und unaufgeregt wird das Album mit einem relativ einfach gehaltenen Instrumental eingeleitet. Bedeutungsschwanger und komplex wird es in späteren Tracks ja noch genug werden. ""Das Album klingt zu sehr nach Peter Hammill Solo"" Nun, einige Stücke klingen wirklich schon sehr nach PH solo (INTERFERENCE PATTERNS, ONLY IN A WHISPER). Das macht mir persönlich aber überhaupt nichts aus, da ich PH auch als Solokünstler sehr schätze. Viel schlimmer würde ich es finden, wenn VDGG plötzlich nach einer ganz anderen bekannten Band klingen würden oder sich an irgendwelche aktuellen Trends anbiedern würden... ""Peter Hammills Gitarrenspiel kann nach wie vor nicht überzeugen"" Einigen wir uns doch darauf, dass aus PH höchstwahrscheinlich kein Weltklasse-Gitarrist mehr werden wird. Im Rahmen seiner Möglichkeiten macht er auf TRISECTOR m.E. das einzig Vernünftige: nicht mehr wollen, als er wirklich kann, und das, was er kann, wohldosiert und effektvoll einsetzen. Überflüssiges und technisch offensichtlich limitiertes Gitarren-Geschraddel hatten wir auf früheren VDGG- und PH-Alben leider immer wieder mal... ""David Jackson fehlt der Band (nicht)"" Schwieriger Punkt, aber fangen wir mal mit den positiven Aspekten an: jetzt kommen Orgel und auch Schlagzeug eine höhere Bedeutung und Verantwortung als vorher zu. Kommt mir persönlich sehr entgegen, da ich Hugh Bantons Spiel sehr mag. Auch das Schlagzeug macht seine Sache sehr gut, ist variabel und vermag Akzente zu setzen. Der Sound insgesamt wirkt kompakter (sehe ich jetzt mal eher als Vor- denn als Nachteil), aber leider auch ein Stück weit berechenbarer. Womit wir bei den Nachteilen wären: der ein oder anderen Passage hätte David Jacksons Saxophon durchaus gut getan. Jedenfalls ertappe ich mich beim Hören immer wieder, wie ich an der ein oder anderen Stelle intuitiv, aber leider vergeblich, auf den Einsatz eines Saxaphons warte. ""OVER THE HILL ist heute schon der Prog-Song des Jahres"" Sagen wir mal so: er könnte es sein. Wären da nicht die äußerst nervigen und aufnahmetechnisch absolut unprofessionellen Orgel-Edits (Einsetzen und Ausblenden der Orgel-Passagen werden auf diesem Song von einem lauten, spätestens unter Kopfhörern unüberhörbaren Rauschen begleitet), die mir den Genuß dieses ansonsten überragenden Longtracks fast komplett vergällen. Werde da mal mit Musikbearbeitungssoftware rangehen und sehen, was sich da vielleicht noch machen lässt... Abschließend bleibt mir nur noch zu sagen, dass TRISECTOR meine Erwartungen an ein VDGG-Album insgesamt erfüllt.  Mit PRESENT war ich nicht so recht zufrieden , aber auf TRISECTOR stimmt die Mischung jetzt wieder und auch die alte Magie kommt jetzt wieder besser zur Geltung. 4 Sterne!"
4,Für alle Party-Freaks ist diese CD zu empfehlen.
5,"jede alice-cd ist etwas ganz besonderes und man kann sie auch nach jahren hören, ohne das sie verstaubt klingen! die neue ist eindeutig ein juwel, jeder song unverwechselbar, macht wirklich süchtig! dazu ihre ganz besondere stimme die einfach nur faszination auslöst. ganz weit weg von plastik-stars und italo-pop-kitsch! unbedingt kaufen und immer wieder hören!!!"
1,"Naja dieses Weihnachtsalbum ist ja nicht gerade das Beste. Vorallem weil sich fast jeder Song in der Melodie gleich anhört. Das einziege was hier sich unter den einzelnen Song unterscheidet sind die Texte. Bei fast jedem Song, außer bei zwei oder so, wurde nur die gleiche Gitarrenrhytmik verwendet, und das ist das was dieses Album so langweilig macht. Deswegen hören sich alle fast gleich an und auf dauer wird diese CD langweilig. Diese CD ist echt nicht zu emphelen."
1,"Ich frage mich immerwieder, warum Lukas Hilbert irgendwelche fremden Leute zusammenscheißt, das sie nicht singen könnten und doof aussehen. Das Problem ist, er kann selbst nicht singen. Da hat er sich wahrscheinlich gedacht, ich hol' mir meine neue Freundin Trina, die ich bei Popstars gefunden habe, und lass' sie in meiner neuen Single mal mitsingen, damit wenigstens einer singen kann. Das Problem ist beide können nicht gescheit vor der Kamera stehen, bei Trina sieht es ziemlich unsicher aus, und der ""König"" höchstpersönlich kann seine Mundbewegungen nicht korrekt ausführen. Der Song ist so schnulzig, das es keinen Spaß macht ihn nur anzuhören. ""Was ich an dir mag"" konnte man wenigstens anhören. Aber das hier kann man den Hasen geben. Wenn er in 3 oder 4 Jahren nochwas sein will, sollte er schleunigst neue Texte machen und seinen Musikstil ändern. Und noch singen lernen, und lernen wie man cool vor der Kamera steht,  und aufhören Leute die nicht singen können zu beurteilen, zumindest bevor er es selbst nicht kann."
1,"Viele""Künstler"" machen es sich heute rech einfach, so auch Sarah Connor. Man nehme einen altbekannten Audiostream (hier: Unbreak My Heart von Toni Braxton) trällert ein bisschen Herzschmerztext dazu und fertig ist die neue Single. Den meisten gefällts leider, mir ist das etwas zu plump. Von daher, ein Stern, nicht mehr und nicht weniger."
5,"""Skin on Skin"" gehört eindeutig zu den besten Stücken auf Sarah Connors zweiten Album ""Unbelievable"" und erinnert zudem stark an ""From Sarah with love"", dem Smash-Hit des letzten Jahres. Allerdings sind die Töne diesmal noch ein kleinwenig seichter und verzaubern zugleich mit unglaublicher Stimme. Auch wenn die Pole-Position in den Charts damit nicht unbedingt getoppt werden kann, scheinen die Top 10 oder sogar Top 5 nicht unerreichbar."
2,"Als ich bei viva Neu sah und hörte  das sarahs neues lied kommt dachte ich jawohl aber nach dem lied fühlte ich nur noch entäuschung pur. Langweilig, stimme kommt nicht zum vorschein  wenn ich das lied höre denk ich imma nur an schlafen schlafen und schlafen  srry aber das ist meine meinung    gebt nicht geld aus für so einen sc**t"
1,"Leider haben die Leute die im Hintergrund die Fäden ziehen und die Songs auswählen ihren Joker verspielt. Wenn sie als erste Single ""Strung Out"" oder einen anderen der raren Ohrwürmer des Albums genommen hätten, wären vielleicht mehr Leute von Room 2012 begeistert, oder würden sie nicht vorneherein ablehnen. Obwohl ich selbst niemanden der Bandmitglieder toll finde (außer Tialda die stimmlich unterfordert ist und besser Solosängerin werden sollte) muss ich sagen dass manche Lieder mir wirklich nicht mehr aus dem Kopf gehen und ich mich des öfteren erwische wie ich sie summe... Das Lied hier ist jedoch kein Ohrwurm, man vergisst es ziemlich schnell wieder und die Gesangseinagen sind schlecht gewählt. Und Julian immer als zweiten Justin Timberlake verkaufen wollen und ihn deshalb diese hohen Stellen singen zu lassen, geht meiner Meinung nach auch gar nicht. Ich würde jedem von dieser CD abraten, wenn ihr etwas von Room 2012 hören wollt, dann greift gleich zum Album, da sind wenigstens ein paar gute Tiel vertreten!"
4,One for da money
1,"Bro'Sis, die spielstärkste Live-Band (kleiner Scherz...) Deutschlands hat ihr zweites Album vorgelegt. Zu hören gibt's natürlich keine richtige handgemachte Musik, sondern wie es sich für eine zusammengecastete Retorten-Gruppe gehört, künstlichen Pop von Fließband."
5,dieses lied ist so schön von christina aguilera .es zeigt schon eine kleine weiterentwicklung vom teen-pop und ist auf dem gutem weg bis zum supergeilen album STRIPPED. das lied ist wunderschön und ein ohrwurm man hört ihre superschöne stimme daumen hoch!!
4,"...was für ein Schwachsinn. Aber wenn man sich ""Boten Anna"" öfter anhört, entwickelt der Song so etwas wie einen Suchtfaktor. Die Frontstimme von Basshunter klingt irgendwie nach Akcent, und in welcher Sprache der Song stellenweise gesungen wird, ist mir auch nicht klar. Alles an diesem Song ist irgendwie mysteriös, abgesehen von dem mitreisenden, fesselnden Groove. Und das macht den Song eben einzigartig, und doch auf seine Art und Weise richtig gut."
1,"In bester Erwartung auf einen perfekten Mix der Hits der letzten 10 Jahre, hab ich mir die aktuelle DD-Best of zugelegt.  Eine einzige Fehlentscheidung. Die Lieder sind ganz gut. Allerdings hat man sich an ihnen sattgehört. Sie sind nichtmal so bearbeitet, dass man sagen kann okay, der Mix ist toll. Aber hier wurden nur einige Hits kopiert und auf einer neuen CD zusammengestellt. Das kann ich aber zu Hause auch selbst. Ich kann nur sagen: Lasst die Finger von den CD. Sind das Geld echt nicht wert!"
1,"Melodie , Rhytmus ,Text ,Arrangements -alles schon dagewesen ,Mamacita ,You can get it ,Baby blue. Wer soll das hören kaufen ???? Unvrstellbar die positiven Reaktionen für so einen Mist!"
5,"Obwohl ich der französischen Sprache nicht mächtig bin, gehört dieses Album meiner Meinung nach zu den besten meiner Sammlung. Die Stimmung dieses Album entspannt und erfreut wie kaum ein anderes. Die schnelleren Stücke erheitern und haben den unvermeidbaren Effekt, dass mann einfach zum Takt mitwippt oder gar tanzt. Ganz klar keine Musik für nebenbei, sondern Musik der man sich voll hingibt und sich ganz einfangen lässt."
5,"Anders als mein Vorgänger finde ich die Songs der neuen Scheibe hervorragend. Der feminine Gesang ist sehr schön abgestimmt mit Chören sowie dem männlichen Part, eingebettet in wunderbare Gitarrenmelodien, was dem Ganzen einen insgesamt sehr atmosphärischen Rahmen gibt. Der stärkste Song, der angesprochene Qualitäten perfektioniert ist ""The Path of Arcady"". Die Kraft der Songs kann vom ersten bis zum letzten Titel erhalten werden, was zum finalen 12-minütigen Showdown ""Adulruna rediviva! führt, in der alle Stärken der Truppe ausgespielt werden. Einziger Kritikpunkt ist, dass auch eine CD gelangt hätte für erwähnte 79 Minuten.  Holt das Album und liebt es!!!"
1,"Endlich ist die neue Duran Duran Scheibe geboren. Was wurde nicht alles erwartet- nach dem Ausstig von Andy Taylor wegen der ""unüberbrückbaren Musikalischen Differenzen"" (es stand die Zusammenarbeit mit Timberlake als Prod. an) Andy Taylor hatte wohl Hellseherische Fähigkeiten- oder einen guten Musikalischen Instinkt, jedenfalls kann er von sich behaubten bei diesem "" Machwerk"" nicht beteiligt zu sein. Es sollte O-Ton Le Bon .....ein Album werden das an die ersten DD Klassiker -Duran Duran und RIO herranreicht. Was für eine Selbstüberschätzung. Billige Computerspielereien-Drum Beats aus dem Hause Timberlake &amp; Timberlake. Das Album ist so glatt und ohne nennenswerte Höhepunkte- was es  bei DD noch nie gegben hat.Die nicht vorhandenen Chartplazierungen des RCM Albums sprechen eine deutliche Sprache- besser kann man nicht daneben liegen. Der einzige Track der ein wenig Groovt -und eigentlich nix mit DD zu tun hat- Nite Runner. Dann noch ein Stern am Horizont - Last Man Standing- da blitz das eigentliche können der Jungs aus Birmingham auf.Leider nur kurz. Wer Fan ist und das Album für die Sammlung brauch - kaufen. Alle anderen werden nicht all zu viel damit anfangen können- leider."
1,"ich bin ......entschuldigung ich war...rea fan von 1979 bis zum dancing with a stranger album....danach war mir alles zu seicht  und einfach........mit riesen freude habe ich die nachricht vernommen....rea stand wegen seiner krankheit am himmelstor und  schwor dem gesülze einhalt zu gebieten...... ich habe mich auf anspruchsvolle melodien gefreut.....aber scheinbar ist gott ein blues-fan......wenn ich mit dem leben kämpfe, hin und her überlege........und dann kommt da reiner blues raus??.....wie gut das gott kein rock n roll fan ist....."
1,"Der erste (und einzige Schocker) an dieser CD ist das Cover! Ein computergenerierter Alexander im Teflonlook, seiner Lebendigkeit beraubt, sieht aus, wie der neue ""Robert"" von T-online! Seelenlos kommt leider auch der ebenfalls durch die Bohlen'sche Retorte gemangelte Song mit dem versehentlich schlüpfrigen Titel ""Take me tonight"" rüber. Auf welchen Platz er wohl gekommen wäre, hätte es da nicht DSDS und die gigantische Werbestrategie und Verkaufspolitik gegeben?  Wer ist eigentlich Alexander? Man sieht IHN nicht, hört IHN nicht, nur Ziehväterchen Bohlen scheint omnipräsent.  Ach Alex, nimm den nächsten Zug am Prager oder Kölner Bahnhof, mach mal Urlaub und fang noch mal ALS DU SELBST an, das kann nur besser werden! Ich drücke dir die Daumen, dass dein Zug noch nicht abgefahren ist und du nicht zum Schnulzensänger verkommst, noch ehe deine Karriere als Sänger überhaupt so richtig begonnen hat! Mitfühlende Grüße von einer aufmerksamen Hörerin!"
5,"So nun habe ich diese Scheibe auch.... und ich muß sagen alles ist ok.... Es ist ein Debütalbum das in kurzer Zeit entstanden ist und das Resultat kann sich sehen lassen. Also wenn man Rock oder Rock/Pop mag sollte man sich diese Scheibe kaufen. Eigentlich schon wegen der drei deutschen Songs... die ich sehr gut finde, nein sogar mehr als gut....  Und dann auch noch Summer Breeze (hat die Möglichkeit als Single zu bestehen).... das ist toll... und wenn man dann das Cover betrachtet... sollte man Thomas und dem Christian B bei der zweiten Scheibe einfach mehr Möglichkeiten geben.... denn das sind die vier besten Songs der CD.  Und die sind es wert die Platte zu kaufen. Zu Let it be.... also ich finde den Song gaut auch wie er auf der CD ist.... aber ich denke live wird dieser Song der Kracher. - Titel: young to grow old... ist ok...  - I dont feel the same...... hätte man weiter soa aufnehmen sollen wie er anfängt.... Thomas Stimme und das Piano.... toll.... absolut toll und gefühlvoll.... Feuerzeugstimmung... Hitverdächtig.... für mich (allerdings die deutschen Songs sind das eh alle) Song Its beautifull..... gefällt mir auch.... ist Foxtrott tauglich.. aber die Stimme von Thomas geht auch bei diesem Song unter die Haut. The Morning Sun.... denke ich kann sich live super genial anhören..... ich mag den Refarain.... in diesem Lied.... und Thoams Stimme paßt prima. When the tears are falling..... Ballade... mit Hitpotential... mit der Stimme die wieder Gänsehaut macht. Und auch live sicher wieder der Hammer.... Brandnew Start - die Stimme gleich im Intro............. Wahnsinnnnnnnnnnnn da muß ich an Nickelback und Linkin Park denken.... auch wenn der Refarain sanft wird.... Ich denke auch das man den Song live anders hören wird....  ALso wenn man ein Gutes Debütalbum im Schrank haben möchte das man sich auch immer wieder anhört kaufen das sind keine verschenkten Euros. Herzlichen Glückwunsch.... Thomas.... mir gefallen 6 Songs richtig gut... und wenn ich an Debütalben von anderen denke sind das meist nur drei Songs. Ich freue mich ... über diesen Kauf und hoffe das ich das Material bald im Konzert erleben darf, denn ich glaube Thomas und Bühne ist noch besser."
5,"Rage Against the Machine nahmen 2000 ihr letztes Album in dieser Besetzung auf die sie seit 1991 schon inne hatten und 3 Weltklasse Alben produziert hatten so war es nun zeit ein schlussstrich unter diese Karriere zu setzten die leider viel zu früh zuende ging und Renegades ist die letzte Studio aufhanme von R.A.T.M. kurze zeit vor der Trennung des Sängers Zack de la Rocha.Bei den Covers selber hat man es sich nich lumpne lassen Musikalische Größen wie die ""Stones"" zu covern oder Cypress Hill. Das Album selber beginnt mit dem groovigen ""Microphone Fiend"" das sehr funkig und hip-hop lastig ist aber auch ein teil Rock beinhaltet, also schon ein guter opener. Pistol Grip Pump ist dann noch hip hop lastiger und noch mehr am grooven als jeder andere songa uf diesem Album zudem ist der Bass richtig fett. Kick out the Jams ist dann ein Knallharter Rock 'n' Roll song der gut abgeht und schon beinahe Tanzbar wäre. Renegades of Funk ist dann ein absolutes Highlight des Albums und haut einen förmklich um weil einfach alles passt.(Zacks vocals sind top,TOm Morellos gitarren riffs der burner) Beautiful Mind ist dann mal was ganz anderes aus dem RATM lager und dürfte wohl als erste Ballade durchgehen. I'm Housin ist ein geniale Hip-Hop Rock nummer die gekonnt umgesetzt wurde dazu fällt der Refrain richtig cool und lässig aus. In my eyes ist wieder ein song der ziemlich rockig daher kommt und vorallendingen extrem schnell gespielt wird.Zudem gefällt mir das Gitarrenspiel gut weil es einfach immer zu den Songs gut passt. How i could just kill a man...ist ein super umgesetztes Cypress Hill Cover das meiner meinung nach sogar das original noch in den Schatten stellt. The Ghost of Tom Joad ist mein Favorit des Albums auch wenn der song relativ simpel ist so finde ich ihn doch genial allein das riff im Chorus haut einen um. Down on the street rockt und Zack zeigt sein gesangliches bzw shouter können.Der song ist zwar ähnlich wie der vorgänger songa ber wieder geniale Riffs und Bass Lines dazu das groovige drumming von Brad Wilk machen diesen Song einfach nur top. Street Fighting Man ist das Stones Cover und für mich ein gelungenes cover....kenne aber das original nich also halt ich mich hier etwas zurück. Maggie's Farm ist wieder ein sehr geradeaus gehender Rocker der nochmals zeigt das man auf diesem Coveralbum sich mühe gegeben hat. Fazit.....einfach nur klasse wie die Jungs hier agiert haben und immer wieder die songs im typischen Rage sound haben erscheinen lassen und ihrer wut gegen den Kapitalistischen Staat weiter hin freien lauf lassen.zwar ist das Album nun 6Jahre alt aber alles Crossover hörer die noch nix von RATM gehört haben sollte hier mal reingehört haben....ansonsten kann ich nur sagen....KAUFEN!"
2,"Ich bin ehrlich enttäuscht. Enttäuscht von den Lobhudeleien die nur darauf beruhen, daß alles was Herr Wilson macht ja unbedingt genial sein muß. Ist es aber nicht. Merkt Ihr eingefleischten Fans denn nicht, daß sich der kreative Faden des Masterminds durch seine Liveaktivitäten und Nebenprojekte derart ausgedünnt und verwässert hat, daß ""Fear of a Blank Planet"" nur ein Schatten von Meisterwerken wie ""Signify"" oder ""in Absentia"" ist? Schlecht ist es beileibe nicht aber ich wünsche Herrn Wilson daß er selbst einsieht daß eine längere Schaffenspause seinen schöpferischen Fähigkeiten gut täte. Positiv erwähnen möchte ich das Nebenprojekt Blackfield - auf ""Blackfield II"" findet man einen Teil dessen was ""Fear of a Blank Planet"" zu einer wirklich guten Porcupine Tree Scheibe machen hätte können."
2,"Vorsicht! Deutliche Er- und Übermüdungs-Erscheinungen bei den Porcupines. Wo ich früher Bauch gehört habe, höre ich fast nur noch Kopf. Sicher ist das alles toll produziert und gespielt, aber mir fehlt der emotionale Funke. Und Wilson hat noch nie so plakative, pseudo-moralische Texte abgeliefert wie hier und bei ""blank planet"". Die Jungs brauchen eine Auszeit!"
5,"Ich kann nur zustimmen: Es ist wirklich die beste Platte, die ich je gehört habe. Als stolzer Besitzer aller Marillion-Alben kann ich sagen, dass SEASONS END die genialste unter den vielen phantastischen Platten ist,  die die Briten je gemacht haben. Die Titel einzeln zu beschreiben, würde  ihnen nicht gerecht werden. Man muss die Scheibe einfach hören. Schade,  dass es keine sechs Sterne zu verteilen gibt.  SEASONS END wird wohl bis in  alle Ewigkeit mein absolutes Lieblingsalbum bleiben."
5,"Auch die neue Live-CD zeigt eindrucksvoll, warum Zeitungen wie die FAZ in ihren Kritiken den nicht einmal 30 Jahre alten Joscho Stephan als ""Magier und Hexer der Gitare"" titulieren. Auftritte im Birdland, dem Nashville Gitarenfestival oder der Carnegie Hall belegen es: Joscho Stephan verfügt über die seltene Fähigkeit, schwierigste gitarristische Kabinettstücke leicht und selbstverständlich klingen zu lassen. Doch dabei verlässt ihn nie sein hoher künstlerischer Anspruch oder sein guter musikalischer Geschmack. Wie auch das Vorgänger-Werk sehr zu empfehlen. Man darf gespannt sein, wie Joschos Entwicklung weitergeht."
5,"Ich finde dieses Album super! Schade ist nur das mal ""wieder"" kein Booklett dabei ist.... naja ist noch verbesserungsfähig!^^^aber sonst rundumgelungenus album... nur den album titel versteh ich nicht ganz: NAch Hate that I love u so wird es eigentlich wieder ""weicher"" ---&gt; heißt nicht das das dann schlecht lieder sind....sind super^^ aber nun gut... sie hats sich ja in einem interview dazu geäußert^^----&gt; SUPER°°°----&gt;DAS ALBUM!"
5,"die Aufnahme steht allenfalls in Konkurrenz zu der späteren Aufnahme desselben Quartetts aus den (insgesamt 70 er Jahren). Dabei zeichnet sich die ältere Aufnahme durch größere Ruhe aus, was vor allem in den langsamen Sätzen zu einer (noch) größeren Eindringlichkeit führt. Auch die tänzerischjen Sätze sind (meistens) ruhiger und gelassener und noch ""schöner"". Fazit: eigentlich braucht man beide Aufnahmen des Borodin-Quartetts, aber diese muß es unbedingt sein!!!! (Leider fehlen wegen Emigration von zwei Mitspielern die beiden letzten Quartette. Aber dennoch: Man muß diese Jahrhubdertaufnahmen haben!"
4,"Achtung Absolute ""Lach Flash"" Gefahr!!! ""Die Doofen"" haben mit dieser CD eine perfekte Mischung aus Sketch und Unterhaltung geschaffen. Sie waren die Vorreiter von denen die heute genau das gleiche machen wie Olli Dietrich und Wigald Boning auf der CD „Zwei Stühle eine Meinung"", sie nehmen Promis auf die Schippe und behalten dabei noch Stil, was vielen Komikern heutzutage nicht mehr gelingt. Immer wieder gelingt es ihnen, den Hörer am Lachmuskel zu treffen und ihn unverhofft ""wenigstens"" zum Schmunzeln zu bringen. Warum keine fünf Sterne?! Die CD ist lustig und unterhaltsam und jedem der Spaß versteht ans Herz zu legen, aber sie ist meiner Meinung nach zu kurz. Man kann Sie sich zwar oft hintereinander anhören, jedoch kennt man beim 5. Mal spätestens beim 10. Mal alle Sachen auswendig. Trotzdem, allein Mike Hansen macht dieses kleine Manko zur Nebensache...also zuschlagen und einfach mal wieder herzhaft lachen!!"
2,"sehr durchwachsen. die meisten songs sind etwas ""lächerlich"" rübergebracht. ein bis zwei gute lieder sind auch dabei allerdings überwiegt der kitsch. die andere superhits-cd ist genauso...also echt kein muss, schade. es gibt deutlich besseres von max raabe, die eigenen sachen nämlich."
1,"Nach der ersten sehr schönen CD kaufte ich mir auch die zweite von Adiemus und war enttäuscht. keine kreativen Lieder, schlechter Abklatsch der ersten CD, ohne die wundervollen Melodien,die Adiemus berühmt machten. Die CD ist langweilig man findet keine Höhepunkte. Empfehlenswerte Stücke gibt es kaum,erinnern kann man sich eigentlich ein keins dass so richtig gefallen kann. Klar,dass der Stil ich nicht veraendert hat aber es scheint mir so als ob diese CD so schnell nachgeschoben wurde um den Hype noch auszunutzen.Schade..."
5,"Ein absolutes Meisterwerk! Der Sound ist zwar um einiges anders als die Studioversionen, aber grade in den extremen Parts kommt die Stimme viel besser 'rüber und unterstützt die unumstritten genialen Texte.Total Bombastisch!!! Unbedingt kaufen..."
5,"Dass es auch in Österreich gute Punkbands gibt, haben Red Lights Flash mit ihrem ersten AF Release unter Beweis gestellt. Das erste Mal habe ich RLF auf einem Sampler gehört.(""The Red Tape"")gehört, und war sofort begeistert. Eine echt gute Liveband sind RLF noch dazu! Wer auf politischen, ehrlichen Punkrock steht, muss hier zuschlagen, und wer die Gelegenheit hat, sie live zu sehen, muss sowieso hin!!! Checkt auch andere österreichische Bands wie Psy-9 ."
5,"X ist eigentlich eine der legendären US Punkbands der ersten Stunde, eigentlich eine Los Angeles Band. Am markantesten ist der Duettgesang von John Doe und der Sängerin Exene. Treibende Rhythmen und sehnsüchtige Melodien machen die Musik zu einem echten Erlebnis, fast wie ein Film (Texte!). Eine Punkversion von Roxette könnte man sagen, allerdings viel echter und mit mehr Tiefgang und Emotionen. Diese Emotionen lassen X freien Lauf und der Hörer kann sich ihnen auch nicht entziehen. Beide LPs, die hier zusammen auf der CD sind sind absolut empfehlenswert, nicht nur für Punkfans; auch ""normale"" Rock-Pop Fans kommen sicher voll auf ihre Kosten."
1,"Diese CD ist so ziemlich die schlechteste, die ich mir jemals gekauft habe und sie wird es wohl bis zum Ende meines Lebens bleiben! Was Radiohead hier abliefern würde bei anderen Bands unter dem Kapitel ""Warmspielen"" im Mülleimer landen. Eine Frechheit, das ganze auf CD zu pressen und zu verkaufen. Das ist die pure Verarschung des Käufers und somit sicher das letzte Mal, dass Radiohead von mir Geld bekommen haben."
2,"Es gibt Bands, die können gute Kritike anscheinend kaum verkraften. So wohl auch Radiohead. Nach dem erfolgreichen ""The Bends"" und dem beeindruckenden ""OK Computer"" kehren sie sich nun ganz von dem, wodurch die bekannt, beliebt und nicht zuletzt reich wurden, der ""alternativen Rock/Pop-Musik"", ab, und wollen ganz grosse, prätentiöse Kunst produzieren. Dazu sind sie aber wohl nicht in der Lage. Denn was herauskam, ist nicht nur ein schwer zugängliches Album, sondern auch ein recht Halbgares. Es gibt Alben, die machen einem beim ersten Hören zu schaffen, und verlangen eine intensivere Beschäftigung, um ihre volle Klasse entfalten zu können. Auch ""Kid A"" erscheint so. Doch auch nach xmaligem Hören will sich hier einfach keine grosse Qualität entfalten. Der Grossteil der Lieder ist einfach schwach, monoton und einfallslos. Ganz auszuschliessen ist da ""How To Disappear completly"", welches das einzige Lied ist, dass in punkto Klasse an ""OK Computer"" heranreicht. ""The National Anthem"" und ""Optimistic"" können auch noch gefallen, ""Ideoteque"" und der Opener sind ok, der Rest aber einfach nur flach und langweilig. Wer noch nie Aphex Twin oder Autechre gehört hat, wird hier wohl denken, Radiohead hätten sich von allem dagewesenen abgewendet und was ganz dolle Revolutionäres erfunden ;) Weit gefehlt. Sie bedienen sich auch hier dem, was andere schufen, und bringen es in einer eigenen Version heraus. Das aber recht leidlich. Es ist eine Mischung aus Radiohead, Drum'n Bass, Electronica und ""intelligent Techno"". Die Lieder sind grösstenteils äusserst minimalistisch arrangiert, Hooks sucht man hier vergebens. Wiedererkennungswert entfalten nur die Wenigsten, stattdessen gehen die meisten Songs naht-, aber auch gesichtslos, ineinander über. Es sollte hier wohl, statt einer Kompilation starker Lieder, ein 45minütiges Gesamtkunstwerk aus einem Guß entstehen, was aber meiner Ansicht nach arg in die Hose ging. Ist das nun das, was Fans von The Bends und OK Computer hören wollen? Ich denke nicht. Das Markenzeichen Radioheads - schwermütige, dramatische Gitarrenmusik - wird über Bord geworfen. Wenn jemand aber sein Geld ausgibt, um das zu hören, was man von Radiohead gewöhnt war, wird er es wohl bereuen, denn dann kann ""Kid A"" nur als Geldverschwendung gelten. Diese Band hat sich anscheinend ""neu erfunden"", dennoch den verkaufzahlensteigernden Namen ""Radiohead"" beibehalten. Ich mag's nicht. Und wer dieses phlegmatische Depri-Geleier als ""Soundtrack zu seinem Leben"" bezeichnet, hat aber dringendst Hilfe nötig."
1,"Es gibt wirklich viele fragwürdige Bands, darunter die Dropkick Murphys. Der Vorgänger sollte eigentlich schon Punkrockfans die Augen geöffnet hatte. Gibt es einen plakativeren Titel wie ""Sing Loud, Sing PROUD!"". Was ich damit sagen will: Das ganze hat nichts mit Punk zu tun, sondern mit tumbem Patriotismus und soetwas sollte die Szene eher beunruhigen, als bereichern. Die Texte des neuen Albums ""Blackout!"" überbieten sogar das ganze nocheinmal...Titel wie ""Worker's Song"" (bezogen auf die Arbeiterklasse, also auf die Geschichte der Skinheadszene) oder Fields of Athenry sprechen eine deutliche Sprache!"
4,"Obwohl man, wenn man 3 oder 4 Scheiben der Familie Timmins besitzt, das ganze Spektrum abdeckt, freut man sich jedes mal auf das neueste Werk.  Eigentlich spielen sie ja immer den gleichen, unglaublich langsamen und dennoch wahnsinnig eindringlichen Blues. Deshalb reichen auch drei Alben, egal welche dies sind. Dennoch möchte ich auf kein einziges Album verzichten. Hier, 2007 kommen die Junkies, ähnlich wie auf dem ""Open"" Album ziemlich verschwörend und zerstört daher. Verzerrte Gitarren, mit Hintergrundstimmen unterlegte Gesangspartien von Margo Timmins lassen einem einmal mehr dahinschweben Richtung eigens erlebten Tragödien, die diese grossartige Sängerin dann aber doch wieder ins Positive umkehrt. Man glaubt ihr diese gesungenen Geschichten, vor allem, wenn diese unschuldig klingende Stimme dann: I will f..k you up singt, in einer unglaublich coolen, intensiven Art, die einem dann sofort von der zuvor empfundenen Trauer ein Lächeln wiederfinden lässt. Auch dieses Album der Cowboy Junkies ist wieder von Melancholie geprägt. Das ist nunmal ihr Stil. Aber jedesmal lässt sich die aktuellste Scheibe der Timmins auch aufs Neue Neueinsteigern empfehlen. Jedes Album dieser Band hat Klassiker neben belanglosen Nummern gepaart. So auch hier. Nicht durchgehende Extraklasse, aber Intensivität, wie sie nur wenige andere Bands zuwege bringen. Man darf diese aktuelle Veröffentlichung durchaus als einen Schritt zurück von ""one soul now"" hin zu ""open"" betrachten. Es wird wieder mehr Stimmung eingabaut in die Songs, mehr besagte Intensivität. Auf jeden Fall einmal mehr eine Empfehlung wert !"
2,"Mal eine kleine Überlegung: Wofür steht Eisregen?  - Für sehr heftige Texte, die am Rande oder schon jenseits der Legalität wandeln und nur ""aufgeschlossene"" Gemüter anspricht.  - Für eine ganz eigenständige und einmalige Art von rauem, dennoch immer verständlichem Gesang, der die derben Texte zusätzlich unterstreicht und Eisregen erst den besonderen ""Duft"" verleiht, der ihn von anderem ""dahin gegrunztem"" Allerlei abhebt. Ok, Punkt 1 ist geblieben - Punkt 2 wurde stark eingeschränkt. Der Gesang ist häufig clean und hört sich nach Ewigheim an. Nichts gegen Ewigheim, aber wenn ich Ewigheim hören will, dann kauf ich mir Ewigheim und nicht Eisregen! Wo die cleanen Parts beim Vorgänger ""Wundwasser"" noch eher dezent und auch passend eingesträut waren, sind es hier einfach zu viele, welche oft auch noch vollkommen deplatziert wirken. Es mag ja schön sein dass Herr Roth nun singen gelernt hat, aber er sollte doch bei seinen Wurzeln bleiben und besser wieder das machen, was er am Besten kann und auch zu Eisregen passt..."
1,"Wie meist, hetzt Nagano auch hier durch die kostbare Partitur, ohne nach rechts oder links zu sehen: Der Humor, die schönen Details der ""Orangen"" scheinen ihn nicht zu interessieren. Gute Sängerbesetzung, aber das Stück findet nicht statt, es werden nur eine Menge Sechzehntelnoten exekutiert."
2,"Als normale Folge hätte HLE leicht ein Highlight der Reihe werden können, weil der Fall spannend und ungewöhnlich düster ist und die Sprecher wie immer super sind. Das Manko ist tatsächlich die Interaktion des Hörers. Der Spannungsbogen wird immer wieder durch die selben langatmigen Erklärungen unterbrochen und zuviele Entscheidungen führen zu immer den gleichen Enden. Die Idee des ""Mitratens"" ist aber nicht schlecht, muss jedoch ambitionierter umgesetzt werden."
1,"Die Handlung ist leider hanebüchen und an den Haaren herbeigezogen. Man gaukelt einer Gruppe Flugreisenden vor, sie wären durch einen Flug über das ""Dreieck"" in die Vergangenheit geschleudert worden... schön, aber das die Flugreisenden das so einfach und ohne größeren Widerspruch glauben stimmte mich schon seeehr skeptisch... Aber die Serie heißt schließlich nicht umsonst ""Die Dr3i"", so ist es also rein handlungstechnisch logisch, daß natürlich unsere drei Freunde (zunächst nur Jupe) ihre Zweifel daran haben, bevor sie daran gehen diese triviale Scharade aufzuklären... Mehr gibt es von meiner Seite nicht zu sagen, nur das die Enttäuschung über die Serie mehr überwiegt als die Begeisterung. Europa macht tatsächlich da weiter wo mit Folge 120 Schluß war: dahintröpfelnde Geschichtchen ohne Spannung und alles immer wieder nach dem selben ausgelutschten Schema Wem das alles reicht: bitteschön, mir ist das allerdings zu wenig! Wenn ich mir zukünftig ein SCHLECHTES Hörspiel kaufe, dann bestimmt nicht von Europa..."
5,"Und das tut es wirklich :D Das Album ist heute angekommen und ich kann sagen es ist sehr gut gelungen. Es gibt viel neues zu entdecken und das Thema ""Energie"" wurde an sich sehr gut umgesetzt. Besonders gefallen haben mir Disco, was wirklich mal was ganz neues ist aber auch Angst oder Teil von mir sind sehr gut gelungen. Von den wenigen Balladen bin ich nicht sehr überzeugt aber das hängt wohl damit zusammen, dass ich nicht wirklich auf Balladen stehe. Sehr schockiert war ich allerdings als ich die Version von ""Innen alles neu"" gehört habe, die sich nicht mit der Version vom RaR08 Auftritt gleicht. Finde ich sehr schade,weil mir diese Version sehr gut gefallen hat. Die jetztige Version hört sich ein bisschen nach ""Zensur"" an aber naja. Fazit: Der Kauf Lohnt sich auf jedenfall und ich freue mich schon auf mehr! ""Es passiert etwas, wenn man Laut macht. Definitiv!"""
1,"Dieses Mok Album ist eine sehr große Entäuschung,der macht immer das selbe,nie tut er mal abwechslung in den liedern bringen....""ich bin der Hustler"" ""ich bin der beste"" blablabla...."
1,"Ich habe mir dieses Album angehört, da meine Freundin es mir empfohlen hat. Da mir ""Ich könnte dich..."" und ""Sterben"" schon nicht gefallen hatten, ging ich mit leichten Vorurteilen an diese CD ran, welche nicht korrigiert, sondern verstärkt wurden. Allein der Titel des ersten Liedes zeugt von EInfallsreichtum (hrhr) und ihr Ge""singe"", vielmher geschreie, in den restlichen Liedern tut sein übriges, um diese CD in ein schlechtes Licht zu rücken. Ich kann diese CD überhaupt nicht empfehlen!"
5,"Mike Patton, ein Sänger der schon immer versuchte sämtliche musikalische Extreme auszuloten und musikalische Barrieren zu überwinden. Seine unverkennbare Stimme verleiht der Musik immer seine eigene Note. Mit diesem Album ist Patton da angekommen, wo er schon immer hin wollte. Noch nie lagen Genie und Wahnsinn so nah bei einander. 'Delirium cordia' ist im allgemeinen nicht mehr als 'Musik' zu definieren, eher als Klang und/oder Geräusch. Doch dieser atemberaubende Klangteppich lässt einen in Null-Komma-Nix alles um sich vergessen. Man gerät in die Fänge des großen Meisters Mike Patton. Und dieses Stadium des Gefangenseins lässt einen so schnell nicht mehr los! Wahnsinn! Wer Bands wie Converge, Bohren und der Club of gore, Teeth of lions rule the divine oder Sunn O))) bereits zum allmorgendlichen Müsli konsumiert, wird sich mit Fantomas 'Delirium concordia' anfreunden können. Aber auch diese Personen werden ein paar (30) Durchläufe benötigen, bis das Album vollends zündet. Allen anderen rate ich von dieser CD ab."
1,"Gleich eins vorweg: Mir geht es hier nicht um die Interprätation oder Spielweise des Orchesters oder Herrn Stadtfelds. Ich finde es ungeheuerlich, zu so einem Preis so eine schlechte tontechnische Arbeit abzuliefern. Wo, um Himmels Willen, hat man denn dieses Konzert aufgenommen? Mozart klingt hier wie ein Resample einer schlechten mp3 Datei. Gerade bei Klassik mit seiner Fülle an Klangfarben ist es wichtig und auch möglich, erstklassige Qualität auf einer normalen CD anzubieten. Das wehleidige Geschrei der Musikindustrie, man verlöre Kunden durch ""Raubkopien"" liefert hier einen der Gründe dafür: Hätte ich gewusst, wie fahl, mit beschnittenen Höhen und Tiefen diese Aufnahme angeboten wird, hätte ich vom Kauf Abstand genommen. Auf einer guten HiFi Anlage macht diese CD keinen Spass. Die schlechte Note gebührt Sony, BMG und dem Tonmeister, bzw -ingenieur. P.S.: Habe zur gleichen Zeit ALbrecht Mayer's Händel CD ""New Seasons"" gekauft. Welche Offenbarung sowohl in Interprätation UND Klangtreue!  Geradzu das Gegenteil zu der hier vorliegenden CD."
1,"Die CD ""Bar Tunes 3"" ist ganz okay, aber ist aber zum Vergleich zur ""Bar Tunes 2""(,die ich echt super finde!) nicht mal annähernd so gut."
5,Ich hatte hohe Erwartung an die neue CD von Nile. Diese Erwartungen wurden von den drei Knüppel-Amis übertroffen. Death Metal wie er im Lehrbuch steht. George Kollias lässt wie gewohnt dsa Schlagzeug keineswegs verschont und seine Bandkollege halten ihm an ihren Instrumenten nichts nach. Ein wahres Knüppelfest. Wer Death Metal mag wird diese Platte lieben.
1,"Super Serie... echt. Guck' ich jede Woche und wird meiner Meinung nach mit jeder Staffel besser. Aber die Musik... wenn es eine Serie gibt, der ein bißchen Metal als Untermalung gut täte, dann ist das ""Buffy - Im Bann der Dämonen"". Aber hey, die Leute, die drauf stehen, können sich diese akustische Langeweile jetzt auf CD geben... wem's gefällt."
1,"Nach dem gigantischen Solostück ""There again"" auf der ACT Pianoworks ""Romantic Freedom"" habe ich mich unglaublich auf dieses Solo Werk von M. Wollny gefreut.  Umso größer ist die Enttäuschung jetzt ; es fällt schwer, irgendeine längere Melodielinie zu finden, für mich ist es Klavier""spiel"" in einem negativen Sinn : hier ein paar Töne, dort ein paar Schnörkel und überwiegend belangloses Gegrummel, doch nie ein ganzes, in sich geschlossenes Stück. Schade, sehr, sehr schade. Tip : Lieber Pianoworks ""Romantic Freedom"" kaufen, da ist das Geld besser angelegt."
5,"Die junge Orgelvirtuosin Anne Horsch präsentiert auf  der berühmten Pariser Orgel ein virtuoses Programm. Neben den bekannten Werken von Vierne und Reubke gibt es ein Werk von Mulet zu entdecken. Insgesamt zupackend gespielt und wo es angemessen ist, auch sehr lyrisch. Das Klangbild ist sehr transparent. Nicht nur für Orgelfans zu empfehlen."
5,"WOW.... dieser SOng bringt einfach gute Laune ... Ein typischer Sommerhit, der eben im April läuft ..."
2,"""Singen können sollte man schon""!!! Ich kann mich Martin Troestl (siehe Rezenssion weiter unten) nur anschliessen: Musikalisch sind einiger Leckerlies dabei. Atrocity hauchen dem ein oder anderen 80er Jahre-Song wieder neues Leben ein. Wer dabei auf die Untermalung durch einen klassischen Klangkörper steht, hat sicherlich musikalisch (!!!) seinen Spass an dem Album. Und optisch hat das Cover ja auch einiges zu bieten. Nur ... Gesanglich bewegt sich Alex Krull leider oft weit oberhalb meiner ganz persönlichen Gruselschwelle. Immer dann, wenn er versucht, melodisch zu SINGEN und mit den Original-Sängern/innen mitzuhalten, ist die CD eher etwas für den Folterkeller (möglicherweise möchte uns ja genau DAS die Covergestaltung suggerieren). In ""The Sun Always Shines"" von A-HA singt eben mit Morten Harket jemand, der RICHTIG singen kann. Dito auch in ""Here Comes the Rain Again"" - schon mal die Live-Acoustic-Version von Annie Lennox gehört? Das genau ist die eklatante Schwachstelle der ansonsten musikalisch sehr reizvollen CD. Alex's Stimme fehlt es einfach an allem, was man zum SINGEN benötigt - er ist sicherlich gut im tiefen Grollen, aber dann muss man sich eben auch gesanglich vom Vorbild lösen und einen eigenen Weg gehen - sagt ja keiner, dass man versuchen muss, wie Mark Hollies ""Such a Shame"" im Falsett zu trällern. Es aber in dem Wissen über die Beschränkheit der eigenen gesanglichen Fähigkeiten zu versuchen, ist ... naja ... äußerst fragwürdig. Mein Vorschlag: Bei Werk 80 - Teil III, der uns ganz sicher in 2 bis 3 Jahren ""droht"", denn Teil II scheint umsatztechnisch sehr erfolgreich: Musikalisch so weitermachen, dafür aber entweder den Drummer singen lassen oder gar nicht so tun, als würde man singen, sondern einfach wieder grollen und grummeln und poltern."
1,"Einen Moment habe ich gezögert mit dem Urteil, ob Vanilla Ninja nun eine richtige ernstzunehmende Band seien oder in der Sparte ""Kommerz goes Heavy"" anzusiedeln sind. Natürlich bewahrheitete sich zweiteres. Das Lied ist so unglaublich geradlinig und flach, man möchte es einfach nur ausmachen. Das ist wohl auch der Grund, warum die Mädels im Video so sehr auf die eigene Erscheinungskraft setzen, welche vom musikalisch minderwertigen Erzeugnis so gut als möglich abzulenken gedenkt. Der klägliche Versuch, professionell mit den Instrumenten zu wirken, ist ein einziger Rohrkrepierer. Jedenfalls wirkt die gesamte Performance vollkommen durchinszeniert und künstlich, am meisten betrifft dies das eigentliche Lied. Man möchte meinen, dass dahinter mal wieder die kühl berechnete Arbeit eines Songwriter-Sklaven der Industrie steckt, soviel Distanz erfährt man beim Anschauen des Clips mit der unauthentischen ""Tonuntermalung"" (denn darauf, also auf diese Funktion wird das Lied reduziert). Falls nicht, bleibt mir nur zu sagen, dass mit Vanilla Ninja kein neuer Stern am Künstlerhimmel aufgeht..."
1,"...und wenn ich nimmer sage, dann mein ich das auch so! Vier hübsche Mädels und ein Quotenmann, der aber, wie wild, kahlköpfig ist, am Schlagzeug treten an die Welt zu rocken und scheitern schon beim ersten Song! Zu Zeiten von The Strokes, The Hives, The Vines, Jet, The White Stripes und anderen Neo-Rockbands, sowie den Deutschen Sportfreunde Stiller, Wir sind Helden, Mia oder Virginia Jetzt, ist Gitarrenmusik endlich wieder hoffähig geworden in den Deutschen Charts. Da lässt der Kommerz nicht lang auf sich warten. Nicht, dass die oben genannten Bands unkommerziell wären, aber Vanilla Ninja setzen dem Elend die Krone auf! Während sich Janette Biedermann, um ihren Namen scheints ad absurdum zu führen, plötzlich zu fetten Gitarren und dem Lack/Leder Outfit greifft und als DORO-Abklatsch für ganz Arme auf den Rock`N`Roll-Zug aufzuspringen versucht, treten die Vanilla Ninjas gleich zu viert (plus Drummer) in die Weichteile des Guten Geschmacks. Der Song erinnert an die tiefsten 80er, an Bands wie Vixen. Nur dass die damals nicht aussahen wie Models mit Gitarren.  Die Lyrics lecken den Speichel des emanzipierten Zeitgeistes, denn Message so kurz wie abgedroschen: Hey, wir sind n paar heiße Mädels und, obwohl das vorher niemand in Frage gestellt hat, sind obendrein auch noch verdammt TOUGH! Nur abnehmen wird den Girls, anders als z.B. bei Mia, Wir sind Helden oder Spillsbury, diese Botschaft wohl niemand! Also Finger weg, denn diese Maxi kommt, das muss man leider sagen, aus der Untertageförderung des internationalen Liedguts!"
1,"Also ich weiß wirklich nicht, was die Jungs sich dabei gedacht haben, ihre genialen Songs von zugegebenermaßen namhaften Djs so verstümmeln zu lassen. Goldie und Konsorten verändern die Songs bis zur Unkenntlichkeit. Mit der  Musik von Bush hat das ganze nur noch sehr wenig zu tun, es handelt sich  eher um eigenständige Drum&amp;Base Tracks mit Textfragmenten von Bush. Ich  würde die Cd nur leuten empfehlen, die a) auf elektronische Musik stehn  oder b) auf keine CD von Bush verzichten wollen. Sorry, aber ich bin  ziemlich enttäuscht von dem Teil."
2,"Ich habe mir die CD gekauft, weil ich im Internet mal ein Lied von Yoakam hörte. Die CD überzeugt mich nicht sonderlich. Die Stimme ist ziemlich schwach, dafür ist die Musik im Verhältnis zum Sänger viel zu laut. Auch gefällt mir die Art der Musik (Elekronische Musik?) nicht, aber dies ist natürlich Geschmacksache. Ich kann die CD nicht besonders weiterempfehlen."
2,"Ich muss ""formosepuer"" Recht geben, auf der Bühne bleibt Calleja blass bis untragbar - ich habe ihn zweimal gesehen (im Abstand von ungefähr einem Jahr, man kann es also nicht auf eine vorübergehende Unpässlichkeit zurückführen) und es war beide Male enttäuschend (beim zweiten Mal an der Seite von Gruberova in ""Roberto Devereux"", wo Welten dazwischen lagen). Wobei ich - im Gegensatz zum erwähnten Vorrezensenten - allerdings glaube, dass nicht die Stimme, sondern die Technik das Problem ist (dies jetzt genauer zu analysieren, würde hier jedoch zu weit führen)."
5,"...dass ich eine CD das erste Mal anhöre und sofort begeistert bin. Eine solche CD steigt dann auch sofort in den göttlichen Platten-Olymp auf. Das letzte Mal ist mir das bei Holes ""Celebrity Skin"" passiert. Auch wenn ich bei Hole mit dieser CD angefangen habe und eingefleischte Fans diese CD wahrscheinlich als die schlechteste ansehen, habe ICH hier nichts zu mäkeln. Eine exzellente Produktion und Courtney Loves mal aggressiver, mal zerbrechlicher Gesang ist wirklich die fünf Punkte wert, die ich hier vergebe! Reife Leistung!"
4,Der Sound ist mau; die Bänder wurden offenbar für die CD-Veröffentlichung nicht weiter aufgearbeitet. Das gilt übrigens auch für Teil 2. Die Zusammenstellung dagegen geschah mit großer Sachkenntnis und enthält alle großen Hits von Shaky.
5,"Da ist sie also, die „Cafe del Mar Volumen 12 - DOCE"" ! Mit bisher mehr als 9 Millionen Weltweit verkauften Cafe del Mar CDs zählt diese Serie als eine der Erfolgreichsten überhaupt und wird  mit „Volumen 12"" erstmalig als Doppel CD veröffentlicht. Musikalisch knüpft „Cafe del Mar 12"" nahtlos an das 3 CD Box-Set „25th anniversary"" an, welches Ende letzten Jahres eines der wenigen Lichtblicke im Chill- Sektor war. Wer wie ich „Cafe del Mar 3 , 5, 6 und 9"" liebte ,wird auch hier wieder voll auf seine Kosten kommen. Ich freue mich schon mehr als die ""Vorab Promotion CD"" in den Händen halten zu können."
2,der song der ersten szene fehlt: suddenly i see (KT Tunstall) und der läuft im film immerhin mind. drei minuten. ausserdem: i don't love anyone (Belle and Sebastian)
5,"""Der Tag"" mit Jette von Roth ist eine der Highlights auf dem aktuellen Schiller-Album ""Tag und Nacht"" und bildet die Fortsetzung zur Single ""Die Nacht"" mit Thomas D."
1,Vielleicht ist sie wieder auf dem Weg zurück. Neben einem oder zwei Songs wirkt alles aber recht farblos und zahm. Sie kann mehr mit ihrer Stimme als dieses teilweise Geplubber.Irgendwie ohne Richtung. An früheste Werke kein Herankommen.
5,"Streiten kann man vortrefflich über sie...ob ihres neuen Aussehens (Plastik-Optik) oder ihrer Körper-Entblößung (Marketing-Trick)...fest steht: Janet Jackson hat immer noch die erotischste Stimme, wenn es um sogenannte Bedroom.Musik geht. Wer Ihre Alben kennt, weiß schon um die Qualitäten und die Stimmungen, die diese Frau entstehen läßt, wenn sie über Moist, Strawberry bounce, sexhibition,warmth, it all comes down to love singt..oder haucht?. Diese Musik funktioniert in einem heißen Bad mit Kerzenschein im Winter genauso gut wie nach Sonnenuntergang in der Abendhitze am Strand...da geht Norah Jones eher aus der Bar nach Hause. Und wenn talentierte Sängerinnen sexy singen wollen (Christina/Jamelia/Mariah/Whitney)...dann wird es nie so sein, als wenn Janet truly haucht oder frech an ihren Ex denkt. Just a little while ist ein netter Teaser...gute Laune mit einem schrecklichen Video. Aber Achtung: Wenn All nite (dont stop) läuft...groovy, sexy, hypnotisch...süchtig machend...RnB junkie...ist funky...und dann: Alicia Keys lässt grüßen...Miss Janet i want you...läuft in America schon jetzt besser als die erste hektische Singleauskopplung...ja..das kann sie auch. Ruhig, sensibel, wunderschön. Slolove...da kommen wir wieder zum Tanzen...und das ist eben der Unterschied. Norah beruhigt, Joss Stone bewegt, Shania macht gute Laune, Britney regt an und das Durchschnittsalbum von Pfannkuchengesicht Usher verkauft sich 1 Million mal in der ersten Woche und macht nur für wenige Minuten neugierig (burn...burned out!)...aber: Ein Album von Janet genießt man...ein Trip, der abends nach dem Nachhausekommen mit einem Glas Wein und bequemer Kleidung anfängt...entspannt...lockert...in Stimmung bringt...auflädt...und hoffentlich sexy und erfüllend im Bett endet. Neu und irgendwie doch vertraut. Das Album des Frühlings. Egal was andere sagen."
5,"Ein wirklich empfehlenswertes Album! Viele Gitarren- und Pianoklänge laden einen ein zum Gedanken baumeln lassen. Die Musik ist stimmig und gefühlvoll, kann aber auch als deprimierend empfunden werden. Was nicht ganz unbegründet ist, da einige Texte auch eine traurige Geschichte erzählen. Insgesmat ist es aber eher ein Album, das einfach schön ist. Blunts Stimme ist ebenfalls gefühlvoll und hat für mich Wiedererkennungswert! Diese Musik kann man dennoch in vielen Situationen und Lebenslagen hören und je nachdem tröstet sie einen oder baut auf. Die Tonqualität der CD ist ebenfalls gut. Ich habe sie schon unzählige Male abgespielt und alles funktioniert immer noch bestens!"
4,"Hatte zuvor nur einmal einen track auf DRS3 gehört und war ganz angetan;  als Reggae-Spinner war ich zuerst etwas ""disappointed"", da zuerst zu wenig ""pulse music"" für meine Erwartungen durchschlug. DOCH: finde die Scheibe relativ ausgewogen...Reggae...HipHop...Rock.....gesund gemischt. VIELLEICHT etwas zu sehr angerockt. FAZIT: würde sie mir wieder besorgen!!"
5,"Ich kannte vorher relativ wenig von Bad Religion und hab mir dieses Album durch Zufall gekauft. Ich kann nur soviel sagen: Ganz große Klasse! JEDER einzelne Song ist einfach genial, das Album hat KEINEN schlechten Song drau (und das muss man echt man betonen!) und es rockt einfach tierisch! Unbedingt kaufen!"
2,"Also ich bin ziemlich enttäuscht. Diese Platte ist für nicht aus einem Guss und total seelenlos. Sie ist einfach unterirdisch schlecht abgemischt. The Cure Alben haben nie so richtig gut geklungen, aber bei dieser Scheibe ist es extrem. Alleine den Keyboardsound kann man nur schwer ertragen. Das Schlagzeug klingt, als ob der Schlagzeuger auf Konservendosen spielt. Da wünsche ich mir doch einen Roger O Donnel und einen Boris Williams zurück. Ich kann hier auch keine Popperlen entdecken wie z.B. noch zu Wish-Zeiten. Ein Song wie Underneath the Stars kann bei weitem nicht mit einem Song von der Platte Desintegration mithalten. Die melancholisch-düsteren Elemente aus früheren Tagen sucht man hier leider auch vergebens. Nachdem The Cure mich seit Jahrzehnten begleitet haben ist hier wohl endgültig schluss. END"
2,"Den aktuellen Hype um ""La Dasch"" kann ich beim besten Willen nicht nachvollziehen - zumindest nicht, wenn man als Beurteilungsmaßstab ihre sängerischen Qualitäten auf dieser CD  heranzieht: Dasch hat eine recht dünne Stimme, eine mäßige Technik und ein wenig markantes Timbre - alles in allem ist sie eine ziemlich durchschnittlich begabte Sängerin. Diese Durchschnittlichkeit erklärt wohl auch die Auswahl des Repertoires: Schon beim Kauf habe ich mich gefragt, warum die doch relativ bekannte Rossini-Armida ebenso wie die Bravourarie der Jommelli-Armida fehlen. Die Antwort ist einfach: Sie hätten die Sängerin vermutlich überfordert.  Bei der Produktion der Aufnahme scheint die Optik von Frau Dasch die wesentliche Rolle gespielt zu haben, sodass das Cover  daher auch das Ansprechenste an der gesamten CD und damit leider wohl auch für den kommerziellen Erfolg das entscheidende Kriterium ist. Fazit: Eine durchschnittliche Produktion und daher überflüssig, zumal es fast alle Arien auf dem Recital in besseren Einspielungen gibt. Zwei Sterne gibt es nur, weil ich die Idee also solche, ein Album nur mit Armida-Arien herauszugeben, recht gelungen finde."
1,"Nachdem ich im Plattenladen über die Vor-Ort-Beschallung das ""Streets""-artige, sehr schöne und stimmige Stück gehört hatte, habe ich zugegriffen und die Scheibe nach Hause gekarrt. Aber oh weh! Elektronische Musik für 25-Jährige Micky-Mouse-Leser und polyphone Handies. Ich habe die Scheibe bis heute nicht bewußt zu Ende gehört. Born slippy ist lange her und keins der Stücke hat das Zeug zum Hit. ""Oblivion with Bells"" ist einfach irgendwie ... banal."
5,"die freunde von kid koala geben ihr bestes, und wie verspielt, locker die grooves strömen, stundenlang könnte es so weitergehen. altes, immerjunges aus der schatzkiste des jazz wird ausgegraben, an die elektronikabteilung weitergereicht und wieder retour, leichtfüßig, es entsteht ein kurzweiliger klangteppich.  und dieser teppich ist mit starken fäden geknüpft, kein lasches hintergrund- gewaber, eher was zum festhalten und sich mitreißen lassen."
1,"Ich habe mir diese CD zum Glück nicht gekauft sondern von einem Freund geliehen. Ansonsten hätte ich mich auch in den Ar... gebissen. Ich gehöre zwar mit meinen 42 Jahren nicht mehr zu den typischen Hörern der ""Bravo Hits"" aber dank meiner drei Kinder bin ich doch ziemlich aktuell wenn es um die Charts geht. Trotzdem, ich kann denjenigen nur beipflichten die sagen das es höchstens ein paar wenige anhörenswerte Stücke auf dieser CD gibt, der Rest ist Füllmaterial der unmusikalischsten Sorte, einfach grauenhaft. Der Gipfel ist jedoch der unverschämt hohe Preis, das muß beim Namen genannt werden - WUCHER!!!"
1,"Sie sind extrem schlechte Jugendvorbilder! Schon beim ersten Song raucht da einer. Da muss man sich auch nicht wundern, wenn so viele Jugendliche zur Tüte greifen. Wo führt das nur hin?"
5,"Was ist das bitte für ein geiles Album? Schon alleine der erste Track hat mit Gänsehaut gebracht und viele weitere Titel haben meine sehr hohen Erwartungen nur bestätigt. Absolute Bombe, dieses Album. Die features mit Pocher und Karel Gott sind die positiven Überraschungen dieses Machwerks. Diese Deluxebox ist auch richtig super. Alle Tracks + fettes Shirt + DVD. Das passt und lässt das Herz eines Bushido-Fans höher schlagen."
2,"Ich persönlich find die CD nicht so gut gelungen. Es fehlt einfach was Neues und Freunde des dunklen Raps kommen hier nicht so sehr auf ihre Kosten. Für mich waren nur 2-3 Lieder verwertbar, der Rest ist eher langweilig. Es dauert ewig, bis man sich reinhört. Leider nicht vergleichbar mit ""Tales from the Lotus Pod"" oder ""Black Rain"". Aber für die Sammlung gehört die Scheibe schon her."
5,"Endlich ist sie da, die neue langerwartete Disk der Beatnuts. Immer noch haben die Rapper ihren unglaublichen Style, den sie mit englischen und teils spanischen Raps auszuschmücken. ""Ya betta believe"" kommt mit den Partyraps, die einfach Spaß machen und mitreißen sehr nah an die sehr begehrten Vorgänger ran, auch wenn ein potentieller Hit wie einst ""Se acabo"" oder ""It's da nuts"" nicht direkt auf der CD ist. Trotzdem ist diese CD 5 Sterne wert und rechtfertigt ihren Kauf!"
2,"Was war ich doch enttäuscht, als ich dieses Album hörte. Wo sind die Kracher, wo ist der Rotz? Für mich ist, wie auch für viele andere alte Anhänger der Band, ""Total 13"" eine Offenbarung des Rotzrocks. Davon ist hier nicht mehr viel zu hören. Das beginnt schon mit der viel zu glatten Produktion, die dieses Mal von Nicke Andersson (The Hellacopters) verbrochen wurde. Nicke fand wohl, dass die Backyard Babies genau so zahnlos klingen müssten wie die letzten Outputs seiner eigenen Hauptband, welche sich mit der Zeit auch von einer coolen Truppe samt Arschtrittfaktor zu einem recht handzahmen Akt entwickelte.  Doch damit nicht genug. Die Songs selber sind auch nicht mehr das, was sie einmal waren. Sie klingen oft viel zu poppig, das Aufrührerische des Rock 'n' Roll ist kaum noch spürbar. Bis zu diesem Album war ich ein großer Fan der Backyard Babies, doch mit diesem Werk hat sich das für mich erledigt. Ich gehe auch davon aus, dass sie nie wieder etwas wie ""Total 13"" (oder wenigstens wie die zwei Nachfolger) auf die Reihe bekommen. Falls doch, würde ich mich natürlich freuen."
1,"Ich weiß, dieser Spruch ist nicht wirklich neu, aber er lässt sich leider auch auf dieses Album übertragen: Es ist definitiv ""Eine Beleidigung für den deutschen Hip Hop"". Und das nicht nur teilweise, sondern von vorne bis hinten. Als absoluter Hip-Hop-Fanatiker, wie ich einer bin zieht man sich die Neue vom Bushmann natürlich mal rein, um sich dazu eine Meinung zu bilden. Aber dieses Album hat mich schon nach dem ersten Durchlauf so aggre**ssiv und wütend gemacht, dass ich es gerne zerschmettert und pulverisiert hätte. Kein Schmerz. Aber nun zum Inhalt: Kein einziger Track konnte mich auch nur annähernd überzeugen. Die einzelnen Punchlines sind ohne irgendeinen Wortwitz oder Vergleich. Sie sind absolut stumpf, banal und ernüchternd sinnlos. Eine Pointe sucht man vergeblich. Inhaltlich sind die Texte durchgehend schlecht und sprachlich mehr als schwach. Sie sind unauthentisch und aufgesetzt. Raptechnisch ist die ganze Platte unterstes Niveau. Der Overkill an Obzönitäten macht das nicht gerade besser. Die Flows sind eintönig und langweilig. Man möchte wirklich ko**tzen! Von den Beats mal ganz zu schweigen, die man alle schon von früheren Alben kennt. Null Abwechslung und null Innovation. Bushido und Fler fehlt es schlichtweg an lyrischer Raffinesse. Man kann sie als Gangsterrapper einfach nicht erstnehmen, weil sie für das Genre einfach zu einfallslos und beschränkt sind. Mal wieder haben es die beiden Arschf**cken-Rapper aus Berlin geschafft, ihren Fans mit einer hirnlosen Kommerz-Lachnummer-Platte das Geld aus den Taschen zu ziehen. Das ist zwar extrem bemitleidenswert, aber wer das mit sich machen lässt ist vermutlich auch selbst schuld."
5,ich hatte seinerzeits die blutrote vinylfassung mit dem original-cover... das cover machte seinem inhalt alle ehre... pathologischer grindcore der übelsten sorte.. kein vergleich zur späteren death metal phase von carcass... neben terrorizers world downfall DIE kultscheibe des grindcore!!!
1,"Mit dem brandneuen Album MT3 knüpfen die Massiven Töne nahtlos an ihre Single ""Cruisen"" an. Das Ergebnis ist dementsprechend lächerlich. Zugegeben, die Beats sind ziemlich gut geworden, doch was nützen gute Beats, wenn die Rapper einfach nicht überzeugen können. Dabei zählten die Töne zu einer der besten Bands im deutschen Hip Hop. Doch das war noch zu Zeiten von ""Kopfnicker"", als Wasi noch Bandmitglied war. Doch der ist nach dem zweiten Album ausgestiegen...warum wohl... Damals gab es noch echt gute Titel wie ""Kopfnicker"" und ""Nichtsnutz"", auf dem 2. Album gab es dann schon weniger hörenswertes. Einziger Lichtblick war ""Die Geister scheiden sich"". Das war natürlich ein Solotrack von Wasi. Wie auch immer... Diese Scheibe ist nichts weiter als Kiddierap vom feinsten. Prollige ""Autos und Frauen""-Tracks, wie man sie von den Amis so schon tausendmal gehört hat und einige peinliche Versuche sozialkritische Texte zu bringen. Das klingt aus Ju's Mund aber eher wie: ""Ey Junge! Nazis sind voll derbe unkrass, ey!"" Peinlich, peinlich.... Schade, dass man nicht 0 Sterne geben kann. So muss ich einen zu viel geben."
1,"Ein selbstverliebter hip hopper mit wenig ausstrahlung, präsentiert eine Single mit den wahrscheinlich schlechtesten Texten die ich je gehört habe. Hier ein kurzer Auszug: ""Ich bin der beste den es gibt gibt gibt gibt - jetzt kommt mein neuer hit hit hit hit""  Hut ab sowas zu behaupten wenn man so ein ""sh*t"" von sich gibt. Ein unterhaltsamer Beat ist jedoch zuhören und egal wie blöd die Scheibe auch sein mag, scheint sie bei einigen hören angekomen sein (bei mir jetzt persöhnlich nicht, denn ich persöhnlich halte das für den reinsten Schwachsinn).  In diesem Fall muss wohl jeder für sich entscheiden...."
5,"wer diese CD der kubanischen Buena Vista Youngster nicht zuhaus hat weiss nicht was  Lebensgefühl ist...Besser, authentischer als die vorigen CDs ist das ein Aufstieg in die Oberklasse- Latin Grammy zu Recht!!! Hörtipp: Song 6: Reina de la calle. Und wenn ihr Chance habt: LIVE reintun!!"
4,"Auch wenn das Amnesia auf Ibiza einzigartig ist (nicht zuletzt wegen eines der weltbesten Soundsysteme) hat man mit der Amnesia Underground das vielleicht beste Mittel, auch im heimischen Wohnzimmer ibizenkisch abzufeiern ;-) Der Sound ist Minimal/Techno/Techhouse und besonders für alle Freunde der montäglichen Cocoon Parties von und mit Sven Väth zu empfehlen. Auf der offiziellen Amnesia Homepage kann man bereits in den Sampler reinhören. Der Vorgeschmack ist vielversprechend."
5,"Phallus Dei ist eine verdammt heiße Scheibe aus der guten alten Krautrockzeit und hat die 37(!) Jahre, die sie bereits aufm Buckel hat, extrem gut und unbeschadet überstanden. Das Mastering samt extrem liebevoll gestaltetem Digipak ist ebenso über jeden Zweifel erhaben. Musikalisch erwartet einen eine sehr wilde Mischung aus psychedelischen und experimentellen Rockspielarten sämtlicher Facetten. Und einen guten Schuß Individualität und Unerhörtes an neuartigen Soundwelten. Da tun sich wirklich Welten auf. Amon Düül II waren trotz zeitweiliger Bedröhnung, sehr versierte Musiker, und wurden auf späteren Alben sogar ""noch besser"". Vergleiche mit den frühen Pink Floyd und Velvet Underground sind sicher berechtigt, aber wirklich nur die Spitze dieses genialen Eisbergs. Die gebrannten Kinder erschufen sich Ihre eigene neue kulturelle Welt und Sprache und wollten sich nicht ausschließlich auf die Vorgaben englischer und amerikanischer Mitbewerber beschränken. Das es Ihnen vollends gelungen ist, ist bereits reichlich dokumentiert. Tretet ein in eine wundersame, eigensinnige und oft auch eigenartig-schöne Welt und genießt unsere Helden von Daheim. Das ist fast schon romantisch im Rückblick, aber ohne jeden Kitsch. Alles Liebe und ganz viel Freude mit Phallus Dei. ps: auch die Bonustitel sind sehr sehr hörenswert, wenn auch ein klein wenig ""moderner""."
4,"Pünktlich zum Weihnachtsgeschäft ist es am 13. Dezember mal wieder so weit. Ein neues post mortem Album wird auf den Markt geworfen, um im Namen Tupac's wieder einmal reichlich Geld zu scheffeln."
4,"Royce da 5'9'' holt sich DJ Premier und Statik Selektath an Bord und haut noch mal ein sehr gutes Mixtape auf den Markt. Dabei kann er sogar auf neue Tracks zurückgreifen, die unter anderem vom unantastbaren DJ Premier produziert wurden (""Hit em!"", ""Ding! Ding!""), auch wenn diese schon seit einiger Zeit im Netz rumschwirren. Auch die Burner Tracks ""Street Hop"" und ""The Dream"" solltem nur den Hardcore Fans schon bekannt sein. Ansonsten rappt Royce noch zusammen mit der DJ Premier Entdeckung Termanology  auf dem passablen ""What you call that"". Neben bekannten DJ Premier Beats (Nas is like, So ghetto, A Million &amp; One more Question, Thank you (Christina Aguilera) freestylt der Detroiter weiter über Alchemist und Kanye West Instrumentals, sowie über Chartstürmer wie ""Tell you why I'm hot"". Selbstverständlich ist die Qualität der Freestyle Texte nicht zu vergleichen mit vollständigen Songs. Aber Royce schafft es auch mit ""Aus dem Bauch raus"" Texten den Hörer zu unterhalten. Das Warten auf das neue Album beginnt."
1,also was is nur aus ja rule geworden?sein erstes album war der hammer und jetzt?er singt anstatst zu rappen.er tretet sein talent mit füssen.nur dass leid pop niggaz kann überzeugen und dass nur wegen der wie immer klase produktion der neptunes.dieses album ist nur was für hartgesottete ja rule fans
5,"2 Jahre schon ist Obie Trice auf Eminems Label ""Shady Records"" unter Vertrag. Hier nun endlich sein erstes Album auf diesem Label: ""Cheers!"" Ehrlich gesagt, kaufte ich mir das Album, weil ich großer Eminem-Fan bin und es somit ""Pflichtkauf"" war. Aber dann wurde ich, wie auch schon von 50 Cent, höchst positiv überrascht. ""Cheers"" ist nicht nur kaufwürdig, weil es von Eminem produziert wurde. Auch sonst ist die Scheibe wirklich sehr gut! Der aggressive erste Track ""Avarage Man"" zeigt dem Hörer gleich, wer auf der Scheibe das Sagen hat, doch von Lied zu Lied werden die Beats rhytmischer und fordern zum Mit-Kopfnicken auf. ""Got Some Teeth"", übrigens die erste Single-Auskopplung des Albums, zum Beispiel konnte mich nicht mehr auf dem Stuhl halten.  Obie überzeugt durch frische Lyrics, frische Beats und Rhytmen zum Mitklatschen. Musikalische Höhepunkte werden von Größen wie Eminem himself, Dr. Dre und Busta Rhymes noch untermauert."
2,"Nett und lustig, nicht mehr und nicht weniger. Sein wir doch mal ehrlich: Befindet man sich jenseits der 30, geht einem dieses ganze 70er und 80er Retro-Getue langsam auf den Wecker. Und die Tatsache, dass die Band die erste offen homosexuelle Band aus den USA sein soll ist ja hübsch, aber die ganze Hysterie um die Band erklärt es nicht."
5,"Nein, natürlich nicht! BRMC kommen aus San Francisco und die neue (vierte) Scheibe ist ein Hammer. Das Trio - Peter Hayes (Gitarre, Gesang), Robert Levon Been (Bass, Gesang) und Nick Jago (Schlagzeug) - wird man nun definitiv wieder mit der Indie-Retro-Etikette bekleben müssen, obwohl der Major Deal bei RCA/Sony und etliche andere Umstände dagegen sprechen. Im Vergleich zum eher folkigen Vorgänger, hat diese Aufnahme turmhohe Wände aus Gitarren, kräftige Bässe und herrlich schräge, schartige Soli, ohne dabei je lärmig zu wirken. Retro? - Rock'n'Roll, definitiv Rock'n'Roll! Soviel zu den Schubladen. Nicht wegzukriegen ist allerdings der dauernde Vergleich mit ""Oasis"". Der schnoddrige Laid-back-Gesang, die GIBSON ES 335 auf dem Cover, die Vokalharmonien, all das erinnert doch sehr an die englische Band, die übrigens von BRMC sehr angetan ist und sie schon im Vorprogramm auftreten liessen. Die CD ist gut aufgebaut. Nach eher kultiviert-wild wirkenden Stücken (""Took Out"" und ""Berlin"") kommen harmonische und hypnotische Sounds zum Zug. Beim Hören sind mir ausser ""Oasis"" spontan eine ganze Menge Bands eingefallen. Dies muss man als Zitate und nicht als Kopien begreifen, und hat seine Ursache wohl auch teilweise darin, dass ich seit dem Punkrock, Mitte der Siebziger, so ziemlich alles in Echtzeit auf mich einwirken liess. Die Platte sei damit zum Kauf empfohlen. Wem Vergleiche (die immer etwas hinken) nützen: Big Sugar, Black Crowes, White Stripes, Züri West, die alten U2, The Cult, The Doors (man lausche ""American X""), Queens of the Stone Age und sogar die Beatles. Anspieltipp: 666 Conducer!"
1,"Wenn man hier 0 Sterne verteilen könnte,würde ich das hunder pro tun!! dieser Song ist einfach total schlimm!! Jeannete hat echt ne Babystimme und schauspielern kann sie wohl auch überhaupt nicht!! Ich kann einfach nicht verstehen, was alle in diesem Mädchen sehen!!!"
1,"Jeanette hat mal wieder selbst zum Stift gegriffen und ,wie sie selbst sagt, ihren ersten echten Liebessong geschrieben. Wenn sich die schönste Sache der Welt bei ihr so anfühlt, wie der Song klingt, muss sie wirklich starke Schmerzen haben. Der Text klingt eher nach Bohlen-Englisch, der Sound ist langweilig. Schade, von Jeanette war man Besseres gewohnt, vielleicht sollte sie wieder andere schreiben lassen."
5,Eine sehr geniale CD ! Ein Muss in der Sammlung für jeden Rosenstolz fan und ist absolut hörenswert ! Die Musik ist wieder mal sehr eingängig und man kann Sich sehr gut mit den Song idifizieren ! Ich kann sie immer wieder hören !  Wirklich sehr endfehlendswert !
2,"... habe ich den letzten Rezensionen. Auch ich bin ein Helen-Schneider-Uralt-Fan, aber auf dieser CD ist leider fast gar nichts von dem, was ich an ihr mag, nämlich vornehmlich ihre Stimme. Mit ihrer Performance auf diesem Album wird sie absolut austauschbar - das können viele blasse skandinavische Nachwuchs-Jazz-Stimmchen (ich weiß - es gibt dort auch großartige!) mindestens genauso gut. Und der Hinweis auf Til Brönner - gegen den ich eigentlich nichts habe - ist ebenfalls berechtigt: Das ist harmloser Schmuse-Jazz (ist es überhaupt Jazz?), für den er in letzter Zeit zu stehen scheint. Insgesamt scheint die CD der Versuch zu sein, mit dem Namen Helen Schneider und musikalischer Beliebigkeit möglichst leicht Geld zu verdienen. Das ist legitim - wirklich interessant ist es nicht..."
5,"Es kann dem Smithsonian Institute nicht hoch genug angerechnet werden, diese lang vergriffene Solo-LP aus dem Jahr 1959 zusammen mit mehr als 30 Minuten bisher unveröffentlichtem Material auf CD veröffentlicht zu haben. Mehr als eine Stunde Bonfa pur, ohne Rhytmusgruppe und süße Streicherarrangements, sind eine echte Offenbarung. Ein genialer Komponist und ein technisch hervorragender Gitarrist, der auch im Jazz zuhause war - man höre nur seine sensationellen eineinhalb Chorusse über ""Night and Day"" von Cole Porter. Nicht nur für Bossa-Nova-Fans sehr zu empfehlen!"
4,hierbei handelt es sich um eins der hammer alben des noch jungen jahrtausends!ill nino vermischen die härte von slipknot und alten korn mit den melodiösen refrains von linkin park!aber was sie so besonders macht sind die vereinzelten flamenco und bongo parts die die südländischen roots der band zeigen!auf jeden fall ein hammer den sich kein new metal fan entgehen lassen sollte!
1,"Man ist ja von Dieter Bohlens fragwürdigen Komponierkünsten schon einiges gewohnt, aber hier schießt er den Vogel komplett ab. Dieses Lied ist lediglich eine Klangvariation vom letzjährigen Nervsommerhit ""Summer Love"". Anscheinend hält Bohlen die Deutschen für dumm und versucht immer wieder dieselbe Leier zu vermarkten. Traurig nur, daß er Recht hat, es gibt immer wieder welche die den Müll kaufen."
1,"Richtig, als Fan muss man dieses Machwerk haben, allerdings nur, damit die Sammlung komplett ist, anhören wird man sich dieses Werk nur selten. Dieses Album ist einfach schlecht. Aber immerhin war das Nachfolgealbum Monolithic Baby! das beste in der Bandgeschicht, nur hilft das God Says No nichts."
1,"Schon wieder so ein Pseudo-Rock-Album mit belanglosen Akustiknummern mit unterstem Pop-Niveau.Winger war mal zu ""in the heart of the young"" Zeiten eine tolle Band. Und jetzt? Mit diesem Album ist der Name völlig lächerlich geworden und fast schon Etikettenschwindel. So einen derartigen kraftlosen und belanglosen Müll habe ich schon lange nicht mehr von einer Band (?) gehört, die mal zu meinen Faves gehörte. Einfach nur traurig."
1,"Zugegeben - ich bin kein großer Fan von Korn - trotzdem habe ich mir die CD einmal komplett durchgehört was sich für mich letztendlich als Zeitverschwendung herausgestellt hat. Korn hat eindeutig mehr drauf - was sie mit ihren ""regulären"" Alben regelmäßig unter Beweis stellen. Leider sind die unplugged Songs meiner Meinung nach emotionslos und leider Gottes auch interpretationslos vorgetragen. Auch klingt überspitzt formuliert ein Song wie der andere. Lediglich der ""Klassiker"" Freak on a leash mit Amy Lee als Co-Sängerin hebt sich von den restlichen Songs merklich ab. Mein Urteil lautet: lediglich eingefleischte Fans die ihre Sammlung vervollständigt halten wollen können zugreifen. Diejenigen, die Korn aufgrund ihres Sounds hören werden diese CD späte.-stens nach 3 Durchläufen bei Ihrem Händler zurückgeben. Traurig aber wahr :-("
1,"Before I got the dancecore cd I had heard back in town, dropp the bass and Junkfood Junkies remix of the Everybody. I really like those songs and I was really exiting about dancecore but when it came and I listened it it turned to be the biggest disappointment that I had ever had in the record zone. Only Rocco kind of song, that I thought that album would be fullfilled with, was generation of love and that is one and only reason I gave one star to this cd, even the rocco's own version of the everybody is 100000000000000000 times worse than the junfood junkies remix. I don't get why all the people say comments like: best record... becauce it did not sound like I would have imagine because of my previous experience of Rocco's songs. And what is with those freeking skits? Leave them out please."
1,"Seit Tunnel Trance Force Vol.4 habe ich jeden Sampler der Reihe blind gekauft. Dieses mal habe ich diese ""Tat"" bitter bereut. Beim kurzen Anspielen der 2. CD traute ich meinen Ohren nicht... Leider war schon seit geraumer Zeit ein Wandel zu spüren. Es ist absolut gar kein undergroundiger sound mehr drauf. Dazu waren in letzter Zeit zumeist einige Titel gelistet, welche ich schon von der jeweils vorangegangenen Future Trance her kannte...das kam dann allerdings leicht angestaubt daher. Dennoch waren noch andere geile Tracks mit von der Partie und alles war mitreißend gemixt, so dass ich beide CDs non stop durchhören konnte. Gerade im Auto immer eine Gaudi... Das ist jetzt vorbei. Die bislang lückenlose Sammlung endet mit TTF 42. Werde jetzt mal Deans neue Club Analysis beschaffen. Vll. knüpft sie eher an die alten TTF Zeiten an."
5,"Ich finde die DD42 richtig gelungen - wie schon die DD41. Die ertse CD sind House und Cover-Versionen. Aber mal ehrlich, welcher Interpret covert heute nicht oder schaut sich von anderen etwas ab? Manche Cover klingen z.T. besser als die Originale - soviel mal dazu! An der zweiten CD ist auch nichts auszusetzen. Das ist gutes Trance zum Chillen, Abschalten, Träumen und Nachdenken. Einfach genial. Warum allerdings über die Titel 5 und 8 gemeckert wird, verstehe ich nicht wirklich. Für die einen klingt es vielleicht wie Gejaule, aber für andere, die schon seit den Anfängen der DD-Serie und anderer Trance-Serien diese Musik hören, ist es so einfach in Ordnung. Das der Sänger bei Titel 8 so singt, hängt ja mit dem Sinn der Sache - eben ""Trance"" - zusammen, worin man fallen soll. Je ""länger"" man diese Musik hört, umso mehr bekommt man ein Gespür für die Feinheiten dieser Musik. Erst dann kann man die DD-Serie korrekt einschätzen und bewerten. Richtiges Trance ist nicht vergleichbar mit dem Techno-Gedöns! In vielen Fällen (auch Diskotheken) wird Trance falsch interpretiert. Das ist ziehmlich Schade. Diese Titel geben die Möglichkeit, mal abschalten zu können, motivieren aber auch ungemein! Das lässt sich nicht von der Hand weisen! Mein Fazit: Einfach die Augen schließen und genießen!"
2,"Ich habe mir vom Siegersong mehr versprochen. Leider ist das Lied nur langweilig und überzeugt überhaupt nicht. Schade, denn der Sänger wurde von Staffel zu Staffel sympathischer und auch selbstbewusster. Mit dem Song bleibt er genauso unauffällig, wie damals Alexander Klaws.  Sehr schade, aber vielleicht sticht das Album mehr hervor"
2,"Vicky Leandros ist mit ihrem neuen Album ein großes Risiko eingegangen, denn mit den wenig eingängigen, allesamt recht ähnlich klingenden Melodien von Xavier Naidoo werden sich langjährige Vicky-Fans nur schwer anfreunden können. Leider kommt Vickys unnachahmliche Stimme bei diesem Album auch nicht so recht zur Geltung. So dürfte die Zusammenarbeit mit Xavier Naidoo überschaubare zeitliche Grenzen haben."
2,"Mal ehrlich: Auf dieser CD wird uns nicht wirklich viel neues geboten. Wer die Rednex-Alben ""Sex and Violins"" und ""Farm Out"" hat braucht diese CD sicher nicht."
2,"Diesmal ist die Sprecherleistung der Drei überaus solide, aber leider ist die Story von absolut bescheidener Qualität. Diese Rätsel-Schnitzeljagd dümpelt langweilig vor sich hin, um schliesslich in einem der schlechtesten Finalen überhaupt einen Abschluss zu finden. Eine Riesenenttäuschung, aber wenn man die miserable Qualität der vorherigen Episoden der ""Drei"" bedenkt, nicht weiter überraschend."
1,"Hallo allemaal! Banaroo (ich nenn sie Spannaroo) sind eine billige Kopie von Ch!pz. Da Ch!pz meine absolute Lieblingsband ist, nehme ich meine vier in Schutz.  Ihr glaubt Spannaroo is keine billige Kopie? Dann erklar ich es mal: Das erste Lied meiner Ch!pz hiess Ch!pz in Black und darin waren Aliens.  Bei den Spannaroos sind auch Aliens im ersten Video. Die zweite Single hiess Cowboy. Und die zweite Single der Spannas hiess Space Cowboy..."
5,"welch ein glück, dass björk nach ihrem egoromantischen allzu selbstgefällig blümeranten overflow 'vespertine' zur musik (zurück)gefunden hat. und ein fettes lob an alle ihre mi(e)tmusikerInnen, ohne die das album undenkbar wär'!!"
2,"Mein Freund hat diese CD nicht gekauft und das muß wohl was heissen, da er ein sehr grosser Fan von Björk ist! Ich finde die CD auch nicht besonders ansprechend! Die Songs sind viel zu ruhig, gar nicht so Björk-Typisch....aber wers ruhig mag... Bis auf das Lied ""Unison"" kann man diese CD vergessen und hoffen, daß Björk nächstes Mal wieder besseres zustande bringt!"
2,"Was ist nur aus meinen vielgeliebten Future-Pop-Helden geworden? langweilige Klänge, viel zu harmonisch, Gesang, der genausogut auch von Robbie Williams stammen könnte... Ich muss den Schock erst noch verdauen. Aber dass es VNV Nation nicht allein nicht schafft, einen guten vorhanden Stil durchzuhalten und dennoch ein Interessantes Album zu schaffen, sieht man ja sehr eindrucksvoll an Apoptygma Berzerk... Fazit: Für meinen Geschmack zu viele Balladen (Illusion, Secluded Spaces), zu wenig Gänsehautstimmung (Chosen), zu wenig Drive (Honour). Allein ""As it Fades"", ""Descent"" und ""Testament"" verhindern eine noch schlechtere Wertung."
5,"Big Country war eine sympathische Rockband von nebenan, die neben tollen Melodien und Texten immer das Image des bodenständigen Rockers kultivierte. Der schottische Vierer um den Frontmann, Songwriter und Ex- Alkoholiker Stuart Adamson war 1983 mit keltisch angehauchtem Rock auf ""The Crossing"" europaweit bekannt geworden. Der Sprung über den Atlantik in den US- Musikmarkt war jedoch schon mit ""Peace in our time"" und ""No place like home"" gründlich misslungen. Mühsam musste die Band die in Europa verlorenen Fans wieder einsammeln und konnte trotz erstklassiger Alben (""Buffalo Skinners"") und energiegeladener Liveauftritte nicht mehr an die früheren Erfolge anknüpfen. Das letzte Studiowerk der Band hieß 1999 ""Driving to Damascus"" und schien ein erneuter Versuch zu sein, ein Bein in die USA zu stellen. Diesmal war das Ergebnis jedoch deutlich überzeugender als früher: Die Kombination der charakteristischen Gitarren mit breiteren Keyboards, verändertem Songwriting und mainstreamigeren Arrangements führte diesmal nicht zum Identitätsverlust, sondern war eine echte Entwicklung. Die spiegelte sich auch in den reifen Texten, die vom beziehungsmäßigen Scheitern über Betrachtungen der chaotischen Welt bis zu tiefgründig- spirituellen Fragen reichten. Dabei stand das Thema ""Wendepunkte"" meist im Mittelpunkt. Musikalisch blieben mit dem Titelsong ""Driving to Damascus"", ""Dive in to me"" und ""The president slipped and fell"" drei typische Rocker erhalten. Dazu kamen erstklassige Balladen wie ""See you"" und ""Your spirit to me"". Ergänzt wurde die Kombination durch mutiges Songwriting bei ""Devil in the eye"" und ""Somebody else"", wo Ray Davies von den Kinks mitmischte. Dazu kommt noch die flockig- schwebende Zusammenarbeit mit Eddie Reader auf der ersten Single ""Fragile thing"", und man hatte ein richtig gutes Album! Für den US- Markt entschied man jedoch, Cover und Titel der CD zu ändern. ""Damascus"" klang wohl für die Amerikaner zu sehr nach Nahost. Dabei müssten gerade die bibeltreuen Amerikaner wissen, dass die Straße nach Damaskus der Wendepunkt im Leben des Apostels Paulus war. Aber egal: Da die Band gerade einen neuen Song namens ""John Wayne's dream"" eingespielt hatte, wurde der als Bonustrack integriert und gleich als Titelsong der US- CD verwendet. Außerdem wurden noch drei andere Bonustracks aufgenommen, von denen besonders ""This blood's for you"" mit einem wunderbaren Gitarrenlauf und starkem Text überzeugt. Inzwischen sind diese Bonustracks allerdings auch auf den meisten europäischen Versionen der CD enthalten. Nach der darauffolgenden Tour und der Live- CD ""Come out screaming"" löste sich die Band jedoch überraschenderweise auf. Stuart Adamson übersiedelte aufgrund privater Probleme in die USA, gründete ein neues Projekt namens ""Raphaels"", erlitt massive Alkoholrückfälle, nahm eine letzte CD auf (""Supernatural"") und wurde schließlich erhängt in einem Hotelzimmer auf Hawaii aufgefunden. Tragisch, dass die Welt ihn verloren hat. Tragisch, dass er seine Probleme nicht mehr in den Griff bekam. Tragisch, dass sein Wendepunkt ihm nicht genug neuen Lebensmut geben konnte. See you in heaven!"
2,"Bis auf „See you"", „Nothing to fear"" und „The Sun &amp; The Rainfall"" ist diesem Album nichts abzugwinnen. Langeweile pur. Martin Gore hat es sichtlich schwer eine Symbiose zu finden, Fähigkeiten die ein Vince Clarke nachweislich angeboren sein müssen. Denn der hatte mit Yazoo zu dieser Zeit seine Hits und war radio- sowie discotauglich. Das kann man von der Platte nicht behaupten. Depeche Mode ist noch auf der Suche der musikalischen Selbstfindung. Nach hören der Platte hat man das Gefühl, diese Suche wird so schnell nicht enden. Nur was für Sammler bzw. Hardcorefans.Schade."
2,"Das Problem ist,die CD kann man einmal hören,ein bis zwei Lieder auch öfter aber irgendwann fängt es an zu nerven,da sich in der Musik nicht viel verändert,lediglich der Text der gesungen wird"
5,"Hier die großen Erfolge von Hans Hartz auf einer CD in guter Qualität zusammengestellt, wundervoller Sound und aussagekräftige Texte. Leider hat uns der großartige Sänger und Mensch, der stes auch mit dem Herzen dabei war, viel zu früh verlassen, so dass wir mit den alten Titeln träumen müssen ..."
5,"Zu den TKKG Folgen gibt es eigentlich nicht viel zu sagen. Wie das so ist.Manche Fälle sind spannend bzw.richtig gut,manche weniger. Aber jede Folge gehört dazu,damit die Sammlung vollständig ist... Wer Rechtschreibfehler findet kann sie gerne behalten."
1,"Ich muß sagen, daß ich schwer enttäuscht bin vom Werdegang der PSB. In den 80ern kaufte ich mir fast jede Single, Maxi und LP und seit geraumer Zeit stehe ich vor dem Dilemma, daß ich nicht weiß, ob es sich tatsächlich lohnt für derartig schlechte Alben Geld auszugeben oder als Fan Abstriche machen zu müssen...Ein so einfach gestricktes Album wie dieses ergibt für mich keinen Sinn. Wer soll sich denn diese CD nur zulegen? Kein Song gibt einem irgendeinen Halt, man rutscht bei jedem Takt in die Tiefe, verzweifeltes Krallen an der Stimme versagt ebenfalls, denn auch diese ist nicht mehr, was sie mal war...Ein Stern von mir für den Mut der Jungs!"
5,"Der Klassiker im TripHop-Genre! DJ Shadow ist ein geniales Meisterwerk gelungen. Die Tracks nehmen einen von der ersten Sekunde an gefangen und mit auf eine musikalische Reise, die durch tolle Scratcheinlagen und perfektes Sampling überzeugen. Auch nach Jahren kann man sich dieses Album immer noch anhören ohne gelangweilt zu werden, jeder Titel ist durch einen eigenen Charakter geprägt und wird dadurch einmalig. Eine perfekte Symbiose aus HipHop, Jazz, Ambient und Drum and Bass. Kaufempfehlung!"
5,"... und zwar hochmelodischen Powermetall mit Mitsingrefrains. Nach dem leicht progressiv angehauchten Werk The Circle of Life von 2004 sind Sänger Chris Bay und seine Combo mit Dimensions wieder einen Schritt zurück in Richtung ihres Klassikers Eternity ( 2002) gegangen. Dieser Schritt zurück bezieht sich allerdings lediglich auf die musikalische Ausrichtung des Albums nicht auf dessen Qualität. Denn Dimensions ist das bisher professionelste Album Freedom Calls. Die Songs rocken und sind dermaßen tight gespielt, dass sie sämtliche Freedom Call Hasser mit ihren Nörgeleien auf der Strecke lassen. Sämtliche Refrains laden zum Mitsingen ein. Und auch wenn es Freedom Call wahrscheinlich niemals schaffen werden, Fans komplexerer Metal Musik zu überzeugen, haben sie es erneut geschafft ein Album zu kreieren, dass einfach nur gute Laune erzeugt. Besonders beachtenswert finde ich, dass Freedom Call trotz dieser einfachen Melodien, die Aussage ihre Texte nicht in die Banalität abdriften lassen. Dimensions dreht sich nämlich um den Untergang der Welt, hervorgerufen durch Kriege und Naturkatastrophen und der Suche einiger Überlebender im Weltall nach einer neuen Heimat. Meine Anspieltips sind die Metal Hymnen Innocent World, United Alliance und My Dying Paradise, der groovige Rocksong Mr.Evil, oder auch die Midtempostampfer Blackened Sun und Magic Moments und die fantastische Halbballade Words of Endeavour. CD einlegen, abrocken und sich einfach nur gut gelaunt fühlen ist hier angesagt!!!"
5,"Also es gibt ja mittlerweile massig viele (Melodic) Power Metal Bands... Bei einigen kommt es einem vor, alles höre sich gleich an und man kommt sich beim Hören vor, wie bei der Massenabfertigung... So!!! FreedomCall hingegen kann ich im Power Metal Bereich mit keiner Band vergleichen! Sie haben Melodien, die man noch nie gehört hat... sie haben einen eigenen STil, der sich entschieden von allen anderen unterscheidet...  Happy Metal an dieser Stelle ist eine abwertende Bezeichnung. Nur weil halt nichts von ""hail, sword, die, death, blood, eagle"" gesungen wird und keine düstere oder misanthropische Grundstimmung herrscht, ist es dennoch ernste Musik, die auch mal lebensbejahend und frisch rüber kommen darf..."
5,"Erst heute, nach über 20 Jahren nach dem Erscheinungsdatum der Mini LP und Walls of Jericho legte ich mir diese CD aus nostalgischen Gründen zu. Zugegebenermaßen habe ich auch beide Platten schon seit endlos langer Zeit nicht mehr gehört. Und was soll ich sagen, es ist einfach herrlich, diese Spielfreude der vier Hanseaten mal wieder zu hören. Damals noch mit Kai Hansen als Sänger waren bzw. sind sowohl die Mini LP als auch Walls of Jericho die Vorreiter und Vorzeigealben in Sachen Speed/Melodicmetal aus Deutschland, der bis heute hunderte Mal von anderen Bands kopiert wurde. Beide Platten können in Sachen Sound mit heutigen Produktionen nicht mithalten, so klingen sie doch ziemlich roh und eckig, vielleicht macht aber gerade das den Charm gegenüber den heutigen viel zu glatt polierten CDs aus. Musikalisch scheinen die Herren sowieso nicht von dieser Welt zu sein. Markus Großkopfs Bassspiel war schon früher eine Klasse für sich und sehr außergewöhnlich, entsprechend wird der Bass in den Liedern stark hervorgehoben. Die Gitarren brillieren mit harten Riffs und immer wieder zweistimmig gespielten Solis, die einem im Ohr hängen bleiben. Das Drumming des verstorbenen Ingo Schwichtenberg ist über alle Zweifel erhaben. Kai Hansens Stimme ist vielleicht nicht jedermanns Sache, da sie doch stellenweise sehr hoch ist, aber das ist eben Helloween. Anspieltips sind nahezu alle Lieder, bis auf Reptile, da finde ich keinen Zugang zu. Sollte in jede Heavysammlung gehören. Super"
2,"Man kann nicht immer gewinnen. Und so scheinen auch Hansi und Co. nicht permanent von der Muse geküsst zu sein. Aber das liegt nicht am Titeltrack. ""Another Stranger Me"" ist einer der besten, wenn nicht der beste Song des neuen Albums. Aber die Single dazu ist unausgegoren und enthält leider lauter Blödsinn. Zum einen erscheint der Titeltrack in unverändertem Gewande und ist nunmal so bereits in der heimischen Musiksammung des gemeinen BG-Fans enthalten. Wie gesagt, der Song ist klasse, aber wieso soll ich den zweimal in identischer Fassung kaufen? Weil die übrigen Schmankerl auf der Platte den Erwerb rechtfertigen? Mal sehen: Da haben wir hier zum einen den neuen Song ""All the Kings Horses"". Darauf war ich echt gespannt, der geisterte ja schon seit letztem Jahr durch die Fachpresse. So und was kriegt man? Ne ganz und gar unspektakuläre Halbballade, die vom seichten Anfang bis zum ausdümpelnen Ende vollkommen uninspiriert klingt. Für Blind-Guardian-Verhältnisse ganz schön schwach. Es folgt ""Dream A Little Dream Of Me"", einmal mehr eine Coverversion. Ich liebe die BG-Cover! Von ""The Wizard"" über ""To France"" bis kürzlich ""In A Gadda da Vida"", die Guardians haben da fast immer witzige, coole oder bisweilen sogar bessere Interpretationen klassischer Songs geboten. Bloß diesmal wars nix. ""Dream..."" kommt einfach nicht genug ausm Quark. Viel zu brav, da fehlt der Schalk im Nacken, der ""Surfin USA"" und ""Mr. Sandman"" ausgezeichnet hat. Das hätte man sich schenken können. So, nun zum großen Finale. Den Abschluss der Scheibe bilden zwei absolut fürchterliche Demo-Versionen von ""Lionheart"" und ""The Edge"", die es höchstens schaffen, den geneigeten Hörer intensiv an Skip- und Stoptasten denken zu lassen...  Manches sollte eben lieber doch in den den Giftschränken der Studios in Ruhe liegen gelassen werden. Der miese Gesamteindruck der Scheibe wird durch die lieblose optische Gestaltung dann auch wunderbar unterstützt: Das Cover-Artwork ist zwar ganz schön, passt aber ungefähr so gut zu ""Another Strager Me"" wie ein Weihnachtsbaum in den Juli. Die Singles und EPs hatten sonst immer zum Thema passende Artworks. Beispiel: ""Mr. Sandman"". Aufm Cover dieses coole Bild von Andreas Marschall, auf dem ein fieser Clown in der Nacht vor der Kinderkrippe die Klampfe schwingt. Dazu gabs ein Video, ebenfalls zum Thema fiese Clowns im Kinderzimmer. Passte alles zusammen. So, und hier? ""Another Stranger Me"" handelt von Schizophrenie, ein ernstes und vor allem reales Thema, wurde visualisiert bereits im letzten Jahr durch ein Musikvideo, in dem ein Detektiv langsam den Verstand verliert. Hätte man dieses Thema nicht auf dem Cover aufgreifen sollen? Statt dessen gibts ein Standard-Fantasy-Artwork. Total bescheuert. Tja, das wars, die Zeiten sind hart geworden für Blind Guardian-Komplettisten..."
1,"Ein lang erwartetes Album, welches auch nach mehrmaligem Hören in keinster Weise den Erwartungen gerecht wird. Das Werk macht den Eindruck, als hätte man Hunderte von Soundschnipseln aufgenommen und von einem Computer mittels Zufallsgenerator zusammenbauen lassen. Die Anzahl der Melodien, die wirklich eingängig sind und Hand und Fuß haben, kann man an einer Hand abzählen. Nun ist es nicht so, dass Guardian nicht progressiv klingen dürften, aber zur Progressivität gehört auch ein gesundes Fundament in den Songs, eine melodische und strukturelle Klammer, die das Stück zusammenhält und den Hörer jederzeit im Klaren lässt, in welchem Stück er sich gerade befindet. Hört man sich die Communic - Scheiben an, dann weiß man, dass dies durchaus möglich ist. Auf ""A Twist in the Myth"" haben wir nun größtenteils Songs, die mit zusammenhanglosen Melodien, aufdringlichen und melodisch nichtssagenden Chören und der klebrigen, sopranartigen Stimme Hansis im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes zugekleistert sind. Hätte man von den unzähligen Ideen eine Handvoll herausgegriffen, diese dann in den einzelnen Songs variiert, modifiziert und mit griffigen Chören versehen, dann hätte man ein göttliches Stück Musik schaffen können. Man sollte zu Savage Circus greifen und im Stillen T. Stauch gratulieren, dass er die Chaostheoretiker seiner alten Band verlassen hat."
1,"Ich bin echt enttäuscht. Seit Jahren habe ich als ewiger Queen-Fan auf dieses neue Album gewartet, und nun das! Mir ist schon klar, dass Freddie seit 17 Jahren tot ist. Aber seit damals haben Brian May und Roger Taylor großartige Soloalben aufgenommen, die eigentlich erwarten haben lassen, dass sie Fusion ihrer Fähigkeiten wieder für echte Klassiker sorgen. Aber was soll das jetzt? Uninspirierte Bluesrock-Nummern ohne Höhepunkte, mit dämlichen Texten und so platt wie ein Bartresen? Warum singen Brian und Roger nur jeweils eine Strophe eines Songs und nicht mehr? Spätestens nach drei Songs geht einem das permanente Stimm-Gepose von Paul Rodgers tierisch auf die Nerven! Wäre dies ein Album, das unter ""Paul Rodgers feat. Brian May &amp; Roger Taylor"" laufen, würden sich die Kritiken vielleicht überschlagen. Denn Brian &amp; Roger schaffen es hier absolut den Sounds des Bad Company-Sängers neue Kanten zu geben. Hier aber Queen draufzuschreiben, ist leider eine echte Frechheit. Die Songs sind platt, der Gesang ist stellenweise echt peinlich und somit ist das Album alles in allem verzichtbar. In Anbetracht der Tatsache, was Brian May und Roger Taylor - mit und ohne Freddie Mercury - schon an Meisterwerken abgeliefert haben, war dieses Album ein echter Fehler. Bis vor Kurzem habe ich mir noch überlegt, Karten für die Tournee zu kaufen, aber diesen Mist will ich mir sicher nicht auch noch live anhören müssen! Sorry!"
5,"Zugegeben, nach dem ersten Hören des Albums habe ich mich gefragt: War das eben Sting, den ich gehört habe? Und, schon beim zweiten oder dritten Mal: Ja, natürlich war er es! Auch wenn sein neuestes Album gewisse Ecken und Kanten vermissen lässt, die seine Alben normalerweise auszeichnen - ist Sting nicht auch darum so gut, weil er sich nicht eindeutig einordnen lässt in eine besondere musikalische Schublade, weil er sich - mehr oder weniger - von Album zu Album entwickelt (ob weiter- oder zurück, zu seinen Ursprüngen) und sich immer wieder ""neu erfindet""? Das hat er auch bei diesem Album getan, und es sagt viel über die Vielseitigkeit dieses Künstlers aus. Nicht zuletzt auf das Duett mit Mary J. Blige war ich gespannt - erstmal, weil ich die Frau phantastisch finde, aber auch weil sie, rein musikalisch gesehen, eher das totale Gegenteil von Sting ist. Ich finde es großartig, dass ein Künstler wie er, der mit Sicherheit von vielen Nachwuchsmusikern als Vorbild gesehen wird, immer wieder sich um Musiker aus anderen Stilrichtungen ""bemüht"" und sie (und sich natürlich auch) damit aufwertet: als Beispiel: Cheb Mami - ""Desert Rose"", vor kurzem Craig David - ""Rise and Fall"" und jetzt eben Mary J. Blige, wie Craig David aus dem RnB-""Lager"". Ich werde mir auf jeden Fall die Hintergrund-DVD besorgen. Ich nehme mal an, da wird Sting erklären, warum er sich bei diesem Album entschieden hat, Sting der Kantenlose zu sein. Und, egal wie seine Erklärung ausfällt, sie wird mich nicht davon abhalten, auch sein nächstes (und sein übernächstes usw.) Album zu kaufen! ;o) Für Sting-Fans (und solche, die es werden wollen) ein Muss!"
2,"Die CD war eher ein Versuch auf ""gut Glück"". Die Tatsache, dass Norahs Vater Ravi Shankar ist, ein excellenter Sitar-Musiker, bestärkte mich in diesem Versuch.  Die CD ist allerdings doch eher eine Enttäuschung. Norah Jones Stimme klingt noch ziemlich unausgereift, fast kitschig und ohne großen Tiefgang. Die meisten Stücke sind eher ""Fahrstuhlmusik"", nicht besonders anspruchsvoll. Ausnahme: ""Cold cold Heart"" und ""I've got to see you again"", die mehr Vivalität aufweisen als die anderen Stücke.  Ihr Pianospiel ist natürlich nicht mit dem von ""Patricia Barber"" zu vergleichen, es gleicht am ehesten noch ""Diana Krall"", erreicht aber längst nicht deren Ausdrucksstärke.  Es fehlt die Virtuosität,der Mut auch einen dissonanten Akkord zu spielen. So plätschert alles dahin, auf der Mainstreamschiene. Kaum Überraschungen.  Trotzdem kann sie mit viel Arbeit an ihrer Stimme und ihrem Pianospiel sicher noch für Überraschungen bei zukünftigen Aufnahmen sorgen. Insgesamt mäßig, daher nur 2 Sterne."
2,"-Diese Frage muss man sich zwangsläufig stellen, wenn man sich dieses Album anhört, denn ""Never seen the light of day"" klingt, wie ja schon mehrmals gesagt wurde, wirklich eindeutig anders als die bisherigen Alben und wird sicherlich ganz verschieden aufgenommen werden. Als ich die erste Single hörte, war ich noch positiv überrascht: Das Lied klang zwar absolut ungewohnt für Mando Diao, aber gut ist es auf jeden Fall, ein guter Popsong eben. Gerade auf Ode to Ochrasy fanden sich ja auch schon einige, allerdings durchgehend gute, Popsongs. Bei ""Never seen the light of day"" haben Mando Diao allerdings zwei Fehler gemacht: Zum einen haben sie es mit den ruhigen Popsongs übertrieben, denn auf dem ganzen Album ist eigentlich kein einziger Song, der noch nach Rock klingt und das wird sicher gerade Fans der ersten Stude erschrecken und all die die Mando Diao in erster Linie mit Rocksongs wie ""Down in the past"" oder ""Long before Rock n Roll"" in Verbindung bringen, denn solche Lieder sind auf diesem Album gar nicht zu finden. Eine Weiterentwicklung des musikalischen Stil ist ja grundsätzlich erstmal nichts schlechtes,man  muss natürlich damit rechnen, dass man dadurch Fands verliert,unter Umständen gewinnt man aber vielleicht auch welche dazu. Doch Mando Diao haben mit ihrem 4. Album noch einen viel größeren Fehler gemacht: Bis auf die erwähnte Single und den Titelsong ""Never seen the light of day"" sind die Lieder auf dieser CD nämlich einfach nur langweilig und klingen austauschbar und viel zu ähnlich. Bei manchen Liedern meint man anfangs noch, dieses Lied könne einen doch noch überzeugen, wird dann aber spätestens nach einer Minute eines Besseren belehrt, Mando Diao klingen auf diesem Album regelrecht lustlos und nicht mehr nach sich selbst, wie man sie vorher kannte. Sollte Mando Diao sich dazu entschlossen haben nun diesen Stil beizubehalten, haben sie in mir zumindest einen Fan verloren. Ich habe zwar rein gar nicht gegen ruhigere und poppigere Songs, aber ein bischen mehr Mühe sollte dann schon dahinter stecken. Die Hoffnung aufgeben sollte man aber noch nicht, erstmal das 5. Album abwarten und hoffen, dass Mando Diao bis dahin zu ihren Wurzel zurück gekehrt sind, denn die passen einfach besser zu ihnen...-Dieses Album zu kaufen lohnt sich meiner Meinung nach jedenfalls nicht, ich zumindest werde es, nachdem ich es mir komplett auf myspace angehört habe, nicht tun."
4,"Nachdem ich Track 3 (No matter what you do) im Lufthansa-Hörprogramm (zusammengestellt von Piet Blank) auf einem Flug gehört hatte, legte ich mir vor Begeisterung das komplette Album ""Hypnotica"" zu.  Ich mache es kurz: Die erste Hälfte des Albums gefällt mir sehr gut und ist um Längen besser als die letzten sieben Tracks. Meine Anspieltips sind ""Satisfaction"", ""No matter..."", ""Let it be"", ""Love is gonna save us"" und ""Inside of me"". Und gerade ""Let it be"" ist zwar der einzige langsame Track des Albums aber kommt einfach hammermäßig rüber - absolut gelungen! Wie Benny Benassi auf diesem Album generell mit Filtern spielt ist schon teilweise genial anzuhören. Und trotzdem kann ich mir das komplette Album nicht durchgängig antun, da dann doch alles recht ähnlich klingt. Nicht das dies schlecht wäre (Chuck Berry bspw. hat in seiner Karriere mind. sechs Songs (z.B. ""Johnny B.Good"") geschrieben, die allesamt mit der gleichen Gitarrenhook ausgestattet sind), aber das Innovative weicht dann doch mitunter der Eintönigkeit. Da ich dem Album 4 Sterne gebe, ist es meiner Meinung nach trotzdem auf alle Fälle ein klarer Kauf - auch noch in 2008!"
1,Totaler Mist. Die Titel werden miserabel nachgesungen - keine Originaltiel habe den Kauf bereut
4,"Das neue Album Testify überzeugt durch seine Stimmingkeit, Harmonie, reife Texte und Melodien. Zwar fehlen Knaller a la Another day in Paradise völlig, doch das stört nicht. Nicht nur Phil Collins ist älter geworden, sondern ebenso seine Musik reifer. Schöne Texte, sehr nette Melodien schaffen eine sehr harmonische Atmosphäre. Man kann die CD dutzende Male laufen lassen, auch im Hintergrund - ohne das es nervt - und das schaffen nur wenige Alben. Testify ist eines davon. Ausprobieren!"
1,Damit hat sich Bryan Ferry wohl selber keinen Gefallen getan. Die musikalischen Welten von Mr. Dylan und Mr. Ferry liegen nun mal auf verschiedenen Planeten und dieser Versuch Dylan zu covern/interpretieren ist so langweilig wie ein interstellarer Raumflug. Dazu kommt noch das das Ganze zwar äusserlich perfekt aber absolut lieblos produziert wurde. Für Menschen die auf langweilige Coveralben stehen ist diese Platte sicherlich ein absolutes Muß!!!  Ansonsten gehört sie wohl eher in die Kategorie: Alben die die Welt nicht bräuchte.
4,"Sicherlich ist dieses Album, genauer dieses Konzert wunderschön geworden. Aber ich weiss nicht ob es seine beste Cd oder sein schönstes Konzert ist. Zum Einen hat er soviele Konzerte veröffentlicht (Paris, Bremen, Bregenz, Tokyo usw.) Zum Anderen  ist dieses Album am bekanntesten und erfolgreichsten geworden. Meiner Meinung nach hätte dies auch genauso mit einem anderen Konzert passieren können."
1,"Also ich habe alle Albums von den ''Fantastischen Vier''  Aber ich muss sagen ich habe noch nie so ein schlechte CD gekauft und gehört! Ich bin ja nicht gerade ein Grosser HipHop Fan aber bis anhin hörte ich die Fantastischen Vier gerne. Aber in diese Album gefällt mir parktisch kein Song aussert vielleicht noch ''Troy''! Man merktes diese Album hat keine Spiel freude ist einfach nur ein gelapper, Sprich nach dem Motto ''Wenn mal berühmt ist kann man alles Verkaufen ob es nun gut tönt oder nicht.'' Tja aber für mich das schlechteste Album von allen Fantastischen Vier Album's. Also ''Viel'' ist da nicht dran wo man freude haben könnte, aussert vielleicht die originelle Verpackung hat abgerundete Ecken aber das ist wirklich das einzige wo daran interesant ist.Auch die Fantastischen Vier haben für mich denn Löffel abgeben was Musik angeht.Dieses Album ist für Leute die gerne Experimentalen Sound haben und nicht besonderes auf die den  guten ''alten zeiten von den guten Fantastischen Vier zeiten.  Leider sniff kann nur hoffen das es nur noch besser kommt!!! Hier noch mein persönlicher Album Tip von den Fantastischen Vier: Die Fantastischen Vier - 4:99 (für mich bestes Album!!)"
5,"Ein Ereignis: Mit ""Live evolution"" gibt es endlich wieder ein Lebenszeichen von einer der größten Progmetal-Bands dieser Welt: QUEENSRYCHE sind auch anno 2001 der Inbegriff des guten Geschmacks, allein die göttliche Stimme von Frontmann Geoff Tate ist zum Niederknien. Zu welch fabelhaften Bühnenleistungen Queensryche trotz der enttäuschenden Deutschland-Tour im vergangenen Jahr fähig sind, beweisen sie auf dieser Live-Doppel-CD, die in einzelne Schaffensphasen unterteilt ist. Da gibt es die so genannte ""EP/Warning/Rage suite"", die ""Mindcrime suite"", die ""Empire/Promised land suite"" und die ""HITNF/Q2K suite"", von denen überraschenderweise besonders die neuen Stücke, die bei den Fans ja auf eher durchwachsene Zustimmung stießen, auf der Bühne eine bessere Figur als in der Studiofassung machen. ""Liquid sky"" etwa oder ""Sacred ground"" sind - auch wenn manche es nicht wahrhaben wollen - Queensryche-Klassiker. Auf die nächste Studio-CD darf man gespannt sein!"
5,"So richtig zum Lachen ist diesmal nichts dabei - außer dem Ende von ""Nur für Dich"", hihi. Inzwischen scheinen die Wise Guys ein bißchen in die Jahre gekommen zu sein, da einige Texte eher melancholisch daherkommen. Wenn man sich durch die Chronologie der Alben hindurchhört, wird das sogar noch deutlicher, der Spaßfaktor ist eindeutig auf dem Rückzug. Trotzdem sind Stücke wie ""Wo der Pfeffer wächst"", ""Achtung, ich will tanzen"" oder ""Du kannst nicht alles haben"" richtige Gute-Laune-Lieder. Auch die geheime Zugabe hat es in sich, wie beim letzten Album ""Klartext"". Für jeden Wise Guys Fan unentbehrlich!"
1,"""Spass haben"" ist ein durchaus erstrebenswertes Ziel, wird aber manchmal leider mit Vedummung verwechselt. ""Wir woll´n Spass"" vermittelt die klebrige Stimmung einer Faschingsfeier der Waldorfschule. Dass es sich bei den Interpreten um Minderjährige handelt, wird sicherlich umsatzfördernd wirken, ändert aber nichts an dem Umstand der völligen Niveaulosigkeit des Albums."
1,"Ok, ok - fernab vom vercasteten Teeny-Rumhüpfkreisch-Pop kriegt man als Anhänger handgemachter, anspruchsvollerer Musik wohl nicht allzuviel mit in Sachen ""DAS ist jetzt COOL und IN"", auch meidet man die Ballermannschen Lokalitäten, wo das Niveau eher rar gesät zu sein scheint sowie den Großteil der televisionären Angebote, insofern erachte mich noch von vielem ungefilterten Konsum-Diarrhö der sensationsgeilen Show-Gesellschaft verschont, doch wenn selbst zu mir nahezu permanent ein derartig lächerliches maia-hi maia-hu maia-aua durchdringt, muss es ja schon sehr präsent sein auf dem markt, BEZEICHNEND traurigerweise."
5,"Was manche hier haben, kann ich echt nicht verstehen. Klar, es ist anders als der gewohnte Ärzte-Sound...Aber das ist schließlich kein DÄ-Album, sondern ein Bela B.-Album. Ich finde die Songs toll: Der Mix zwischen ernsten Songs, wie z. B. Sie hat was vermisst, Letzter Tag und den albernen Songs, z. B. Zappingsong, Gitarre runter macht es für mich zu einer tollen Platte. Außerdem sollte man mal genau auf die Texte hören... Vorallem finde ich es von Bela sehr mutig, sein eigenes Ding zu machen. Schließlich ist es ein Risiko so etwas völlig anderes zu machen, als das, was die Fans sonst gewohnt sind (von den Ärzten). Ich finde jedenfalls, dass sich ein Kauf auf jeden Fall lohnt!!"
5,"Da mir vor dem Kauf des Albums nur der Titel ""The Trooper"" etwas sagte, war ich doch sehr skeptisch, als ich mir dieses Werk anschaffte. Doch schon beim 1. Durchlauf wurde ich zufriedengestellt, mehr noch, dieses  MEISTERwerk waechst mit jedem weiteren Durchlauf, heute gehoert es zu  meinen Lieblingsalben von den ""Jungfrauen"". Wie soll man nun  dieses Album bewerten? ""Im Schatten"" seines Vorgaengers steht es  nicht, im Gegenteil, es kommt leicht an diesen Klassiker heran. In manchen  Momenten finde ich es sogar besser als ""Number of the Beast"",  schon allein die genialen Opener ""Where Eagles dare"" (unglaublich  hart und mitreissend) und ""Revelations"" (poetisch und  verzaubernd) halten dem Vergleich mehr als stand! Und wenn ich dann noch  den ""Trooper"" dazuzaehle, muss der Vorgaenger doch die Segel  streichen. Genial!"
1,Alan versucht hier in Technomanier dem Zeittrend nachzurennen. Ich fand es graulich und so garnicht typisch für die normalerweise wunderschönen Harmonien. Wenn man die anderen CDs von Alan Parson noch im Ohr hat wird man hier nichts von dem gewohnten wiederfinden. Mein Tipp: erst reinhören und dann kaufen !
1,"Mark hat eine vedammt gute Soulstimme, die er meines Erachtens anderweitig einsetzen sollte, um Erfolg verbuchen zu könne!Sein Singlehit ist super herübergekommen.Seine erste CD konnte mich leider nicht vom Hocker reißen...war enttäuscht!Er sollte Balladen singen, die zu seiner Stimme passen.Er sollte sich um einen guten Songschreiber bemühen, der ihm seine zukünftigen Songs auf den Leib ""schneidert"".Jedes Lied seiner CD, gleicht sich dem anderen."
5,"Nach dem grandiosen Debütalbum legte ich mir aufgrund der hiesigen Kritiken erst ""Nude"" zu. Und erst danach ""Music for people"". So war der Schritt nicht so drastisch, denn die Alben werden in genau dieser Reihenfolge immer ruhiger, wenngleich ""ruhiger"" relativ ist und ""Music..."" ja eigentlich die zweite VAST-Veröffentlichung noch vor ""Nude"" ist. ""Music for people"" geht, was das Songwriting angeht, zwar den selben Weg wie ""VAST"", doch mit angezogener Handbremse. Bereits beim zweiten Hördurchgang schlägt das Album trotzdem voll rein. Songs wie ""Free"", ""My TV and you"", ""Land of shame"" oder ""Song with no name"" zünden dermaßen, dass die Songs vom Debüt beinahe vergessen wirken. Auch alle anderen Tracks gefallen durch feinstes Songwriting und Eingängigkeit!  Mein Fazit: Nachdem ich bereits bei ""Nude"" mit klaren Abstrichen gegenüber dem Debut-Album gerechnet habe - und (zum Glück) enttäuscht wurde, muss ich auch für ""Music for people"" eine Lanze brechen und die unbestrittene Qualität dieses Albums honorieren - mit 5 Sternen! Wie auch schon bei ""Nude"" muss man dieses Album völlig losgelöst vom Debüt betrachten und ganz objektiv einschätzen. Es ist anders, nicht mehr und nicht weniger!  Nach nunmehr drei erstklassigen Alben zähle ich VAST damit nun zu meinem engsten musikalischen Favoritenkreis!"
4,"Mit wackligen Finger, vor lauter Vorfreude, ging ich auf ""in den Warenkorb"" und dann auf ""Bestellen"" Button.  Natürlich Limited Edition... wie sich das gehört für einen Fan, immerhin 2 Bonus Tracks.  Am nächsten Tag kommt der Postmann, ich reiße ihm das Paket quasi aus der Hand und wärend ich unterschreibe habe ich das gute Stück schon fast offen. Dann die CD in den Player geworfen die schon von ""Sleep is the Enemy"" vorgewärmt war. Lautstärke 90%... wir wollen es ja nicht übertreiben.  ""Code of the road""..... BÄÄÄMMMM Luftgitarre angesagt und abgetanzt.  Das Adrenalin floss in Strömen... zack Lied zu Ende dann sollte der nächste Kracher kommen.... doch es folgte irgendwie Langweile.  Ich habe mir an diesem Tag die CD 2mal angehört und ich muß sagen, dass das nicht Danko ist. Ich weiß nicht warum aber irgendwie stimmt das Album nicht mit den anderen Alben überein.  Die Songs ""Code of the road"" und die beiden BONUSTRACKS ""Your ruin the day"" und ""Sugar high"" retten das Album auf 4 Sterne.  Alles im allem bin ich leider ein wenig enttäuscht aber die drei Songs sind wirklich gelungen und lassen mich das Album noch ein wenig hören."
5,"Das Debutalbum Permission to land enthielt bereits einige wirklich starke Songs, konnte mich aber noch nicht 100-prozentig überzeugen (dennoch nicht schlecht). Auf One Way Ticket to Hell.. haben sich The Darkness meiner Meinung nach (für ihre Verhältnisse) etwas zurückgenommen, dass tut den Songs aber nur gut, dass ganze Album wirkt irgendwie viel runder."
1,"Es kommt selten vor (eigentlich erst einmal), daß ich eine CD schon nach einmaligem Hören los werden will. Diese habe ich heute einem Kollegen geschenkt, hoffentlich zerstört das nicht unsere Freundschaft..... Es gibt Dinge, von denen lässt man besser seine Finger - die Interpretationen von Andersson/Ulväus auf dieser CD sind einfach überflüssig und ihre Stimme passt leider so gar nicht zu dem, was damals Musikgeschichte geschrieben hat!"
2,"Nach absoluten Knallern wie ""as the angles reach the beauty"" und den extrem kraftvollen ""engraved in black"" ist dieses Album eine reine Entäuschung. Wo früher die absolut genialen Growl und Grunt Passage einen wirklich guten Songtext vertonten kann man sich jetzt ein fast schon popigen 0815-Einheitsbrei anhören bei dem es den Songwriter scheinbar darum gegangen ist mit möglichst wenigen Worten auszukommen (bestes Beispiel Jump). Schade ... war von dieser Band immer sehr begeistert - alles was ich mir jetzt noch wünsche ist ein neurelease der alten Platten mit besserer Produktion ;)"
2,"Nach dem der Übersänger Rob Halford Judas Priest 1993 verlassen hatte, gab es viel Spekulation in der Fangemeinschaft wie es mit Priest weiter gehen würde.  Besonders nach einem Killer-Album wie ""Painkiller"" waren  die Erwartungen doch groß.  Um so enttäuschender fällt nach 7 Priestlosen  Jahren das neuste Studioalbum auf.   Hand aufs Herz dies ist kein Judas  Priest Album, wenn nicht der Bandname drauf gestand hätte, hätte ich nie  gemerkte, daß es sich hier um meine absolute Lieblingsband handelt.  Und  das hat nicht nur mit dem neuen Sänger ""Ripper"" zu tun, sondern,  mit dem Stil den Priest jetzt eingeschlagen haben.  Priest sind nun einmal  eine Band die ihre Vergangenheit nicht leugenen können, den sie haben eine  ganze Reihe von Klassikern in ihrer fast 30 jährigen Karriere eingespielt.   Mit diesen kann sich ""Jugulator"" aber keinesfalls messen.  Der  Grund dürfte offensichtlich sein.  Musikalisch versuchen Priest mit diesem  Album gerade zu zwanghaft wie trendhafte Death- und Doommetal Bands zu  klingen, die derzeit angesagter als ""normale"" HM Bands sind. Dies  dürfte sich als schwerwiegender Fehler erweisen, da es Priest waren die in  der Vergangenheit die Trendsetter waren und daher den Werdegang des Heavy  Metal prägend mit bestimmt haben.  Keines der Lieder auf  ""Jugulator"" hat das bekannte Niveau der führeren Priest Alben  (mit Ausnahme von ""RockaRolla"" dem aller ersten Priest Album),  einzig und allein kann ""Cathedral Spires"" überzeugen.  Die  genialen Harmonie-Leadguitaren sind völlig weggebliben, obwohl sie sich als  bewährtes Markenzeichen - dem melodischen Guitarenstil von Judas Priest -,  über die Jahre hinweg ausgezeichnet hatten.  Das Album ist eintönig, die  Guitaren verstimmt und klingen absichtlich tiefer.  Ripper Owen ist ein  guter Sänger aber kann Rob Halford nicht übertreffen."
5,"Also mal ehrlich: Was Slayer hier treiben ist mal wieder allererste Sahne. Eine Thrashkranate wie sie besser nicht sein kann. Mit songs wie cult und vor allem Jihad werden hier neue Maßstäbe gesetzt. Ein super Lombardo gibt der Thrashwelt dann den Rest. Ich für meinen Teil kann bei dieser CD keinen Schwachpunkt finden. Doch ich will auch erwähnen, dass ich Devine intervention Spitzenklasse finde. Das vermeindlich schwächste Slayerwerk ist Diabolus in musica, reicht aber immer noch um neuere Metallicaalben in den Schatten zu stellen (Load, Reload, ST.Anger). Aber das ist ja auch keine Herausforderung!"
1,"Wir schreiben Anfang 1980. Metal ist tot(wegen Punk). Insofern erscheint es äußerst taktvoll, daß zu Beginn dieser Scheibe ein Glockengeläute zu hören ist. Alles was danach folgt ist die Hölle auf Erden. Brian Johnson ist mit Sicherheit der schlechteste Sänger aller Zeiten, der sich wie ein abgestochenes Schwein anhört. Ich liebe nun mal Schweine-wirkliche und lebend. Vielleicht sind Gruppen wie äisidisi der Grund dafür, daß Leute wie Nick Cave Australien fluchtartig verlassen haben. Obwohl die australische Rockszene ähnlich wie die kanadische absolute Kultgruppen hervorgebracht hat. So zB.: Rose Tattoo, die noch am ehesten mit atzedeze vergleichbar sind, aber unendlich mal geiler, wahrscheinlich überhaupt die beste Rock'n Roll Combo ( noch vor Motörhead ) aller Zeiten waren bzw sind. Unter Bon Scott waren ACdizzy zumindest anhörbar und manchmal sogar wirklich gut, zB: Walk All Over You, Little Lover, Squealer, Ride On,usw. oder das live in Paris-Video. Für ACDC mit Brian Johnson gilt ähnliches wie für Kiss: Sie sind mit ihrem idiotischen Hard Rock bei gleichzeitigem Sell-out unmittelbar für den Untergang von Heavy Metal Ende der 80er verantwortlich. Vorallem jeder ernstzunehmende Metalfan hat ACDC spätestens Ende der 80er sowieso nicht mehr gehört bzw. gehaßt.  Wenn man sich diesen Dreck in Black hier anhört.... ....leicht verständlich. Oder? Wieviele Editions von dem Zeug braucht die Welt eigentlich noch? Given the fan a bone. ätzend."
4,"There are some things you cannot deny. The fact that No Angels are an enticing, loveable group with great vocal abilities is one of them. After the 'Pure' project was cut short and the girls decided to part ways for a while, it only seemed fitting for them to unite again. The result is 'Destiny', and the sound is definitely No Angels, sans Vanessa who was definitely the one injecting a bit of sass and dare into the group's agenda. This album is catchy and exciting, and debut single 'Goodbye to yesterday' clearly indicates that the sound of the angels is back to pure pop.  Although in-keeping with debut Elle'ments and follow-up Now... Us!, 'Destiny' is a definite step back from the exciting RnB-tinged, rockier sound of 'Pure', which had established the girls as credible artists with a unique pop sound, much like Girls Aloud in the UK.  Yet 'Destiny' is a clearly pleasing and enjoyable collection. Opening number and debut single 'Goodbye to yesterday' is everything you want from a ballad with a light message, supported by a video showing the girls at their best in their ""it's nice to be back"" mode. Other outstanding cuts include ""Been here before"" (a track reminiscent of one of the girls' finest moments, the Mousse T. produced, remixed 'Let's go to bed'), and the eighties-lite ""I had a feeling"". The closing number oddly reminds of 'That's the reason', the last track on No Angels' debut, later reworked for their 'best of' album.  All in all, 'Destiny' makes for pleasant, easy listening, with the added excitement of hearing from friends you had not heard from in a long time. It's good to have the angels back..."
1,"Warum dieses Lied aufgenommen und als MCD veröffentlicht wurde, bleibt wohl das Geheimnis der Plattenfirma, denn da steht ja schon vorher fest, dass die Single wie Blei in den Regalen liegen bleiben wird. Für dieses Projekt haben sich ausnahmslos Künstler versammelt, die schon lange oder noch nie einen Hit hatten, in der Hoffnung, einen der vorderen Plätze in den Charts zu ergattern, aber das wird mit Sicherheit nichts. Einmal gehört und schon wieder vergessen."
5,"Jessica hat ja schon beim Superstar Casting und bei den No Angels bewiesen, dass sie eine super Stimme hat. Ihr erster Solosong ist ein absoluter Knaller. Ihre soulige Stimme ist wunderbar warm und verleiht dem Song einen elektrisierenden touch. Freue mich auf mehr Solomaterial. Weiter so Jess!!!"
2,"Millionen verkaufter Alben der Corrs - Schwestern - mit der Stimme von Andrea Corr. Am Ende wussten die Schwestern nicht, ob sie ihren irischen Wurzeln oder dem internationalen Pop folgen sollten. Und so machten sie drei Dinge: Erstens sich eine Auszeit nehmen, zweitens noch ein Best of Album veröffentlichen, nachdem sie drittens viele ihrer Fans durch zu viele musikalische Kompromisse vergraulten. Das erste Solo-Album von Andrea Corr wurde produziert von Nellee Hooper und Bono (als Executive), doch neben dem poppigen, überaus radiotauglichen ""Shame On You"", dem gedimmten Elektropop von ""Hello Boys"" oder ""Ten Feet High"" mit Piano und seinen Streichern ist es ein langweiliges Durcheinander geworden. Weltverbesserungslieder, peinlicher Reggae, Spielzeug-Elektropop und ansonsten Tracks, die sich anhören, als wären sie von der Resterampe des glatten Corrs Album ""In Blue"" (2000) gefallen. So wird das nichts mit der Solo-Karriere."
5,"Die CD 'Suite en sous-sol' ist eigentlich eine Compilation von 3 Original 12""-EPs von Tuxedomoon, aufgenommen in ihrem wohl wichtigsten und besten Jahr - 1982  (Original 12""-Titel:  Suite en sous-sol /  Time to lose / Short Stories). Entstanden kurz nach ihrer wohl besten, zweiten  LP 'Desire', haben sie auf diesen EPs die ganze Breite ihres Könnens gezeigt:  Von den arabischen, hypnotischen Meisterwerlken der orig. Suite en sous-sol 12"" zu den klassisch beeinflussten Stücken auf Time To Lose ...immer werden meisterhafte Stimmungen aufgebaut.  Zwischen der Kühle der elektronischen Elemente und den melancholischen Geige- und Saxophon-Passagen entsteht der typische, einzigartige Stil von Tuxedomoon  -  Musik zu einem imaginärem Film Noir. Tuxedomoon waren die wichtigste -und sträflichst vernachlässigste- Band der Achtziger Jahre.... und darüber hinaus.  BUY NOW !!!"
5,"Ich bin kein Fan langer Rezensionen. Demnach möchte ich nur sagen, dass diese CD die beste deutschsprachige Platte ist, die ich in meiner Sammlung habe. Spätestens nachdem man ""Zuhälter"" gehört hat, weiss man, dass Wir sind Helden nicht einfach nur Popmusik machen! Nicht zögern!!!!!!!"
2,"Babypausen können produktiv sein - sind sie aber nicht immer. ""Wir sind Helden"" liefern den Beweis mit ihrer Single-Auskopplung, die im NDW-Sound der 80er daher kommt, aber musikalisch und gesanglich den Vorbildern (hier hat offensichtlich IDEAL Pate gestanden) nicht annähernd das Wasser reichen kann. Das WsH es besser können, weiß ich - hoffentlich zeigen sie auch wieder!"
1,"Das Album ist in den Medien total überbewertet! Es gibt wenige einfallsreiche Refrains zum Mitsingen. Die Melodien, Texte und die Stimme sind sehr schwach. Die Band mag ja vielleicht sehr nett sein, doch musikalisch betrachtet sind sie einfach nur SCHWACH."
2,"Natürlich ist es eine tolle Sache, die Creme de la creme der amerikanischen Countryszene ins Studio zu locken und sich dabei von den besten Musikern Nashvilles begleiten zu lassen! Und selbstverständlich singen die Stars auch locker und brilliant ihre Parts weg, aber der einzige Störfaktor bei diesem Unternehmen ist Tom Astor. Sein Gesang wirkt hölzern und steif und er erreicht bei weitem nicht die geschmeidige Harmonie seiner Duettpartner. Für diejenigen, die sich auch Tom Astors Soloalben zulegen, mag es eine echte Bereicherung sein, schöne Stimmen zu hören; für alle anderen seh ich keinen erhöhten Kaufbedarf."
5,Also wer mal schlecht drauf ist und einfach mal abrocken möchte der sollte die genial songs wie all messed up oder still waiting sich durch die ohren dröhnen lassen!Die Songs und die Art von Sum 41 ist einfach so Spass haben und deswegen lohnt sich auch der Kauf dieser CD!!!
1,"schon wieder irgendwelche möchtegern-psychos, die sich für wahnsinnig originell halten und dabei so untalentiert wie nur was ans werk gehen. die musik ist ein belangloses ripp-off der zur zeit so angesagten ""moderner metal meets industrial""- kombination und der gesang klingt wie der hundertste aufguss eines rob zombie oder wayne static. das system of a down wirklich so sehr von dieser band begeistert waren, wie es die bandinfo verspricht, wage ich zu bezweifeln. aber immerhin können sich american head charge nun mit diesem namen schmücken und das dürfte eigentlich auch der einzig logische grund dafür sein, dass diese band ihre platten an den unkritischen new-metal fan bringt."
4,"„Tearstained“ ist das zweite Studio-Album der finnischen Gothic – Metaller von „Charon“. Man merkt deutlich, dass sich die fünf musikalisch verbessert haben. Vorbei sind die Zeiten ewiger Stille. „Charon“ orientieren sich nun spürbar an ihren Landsleuten und Suicide – Metal – Heroen von „Sentenced“, ohne diese zu kopieren. Sahnestücke wie „Worthless“, „Deepest scar“ und „Christina bleeds“ sind der beste Beweis dafür. Das absolute Hammerstück des Albums ist aber das super geniale „Sin“. Dieser Song bringt jeden Lautsprecher zum Beben und danach hört man ihn sich gleich noch einmal an. Wahnsinn!"
5,"Stark, wie sie um ihre Solokarriere kämpft. Ex-Sporty Spice hat ihre erste eigene Plattenfirma unter die Fittiche genommen und mit ""Beautiful Intentions"" das Projekt eingeweiht, sozusagen :-)"
5,"Warum diese Achtung vor diesem Countrysänger? Es ist nicht die Musik alleine, sondern weil J.C. bis zum Ende immer anständig gewesen ist, und weil wir an ihm wie an keinem anderen merken, was wir doch oft für (kleinkarierte Egositen sind. J.C. bringt uns zum Weinen durch sein Leben, seine Bilder, seine kleinen Gesten durch die Haltung zu seiner Ehefrau. Oft hatte ich mir früher Konzertmitschnitte angesehen und gedacht, dass es wohl nicht so klug sei, die kränkelnde June Carter auf der Bühne durchzuschleppen. Heute weiß ich, das es grenzenlose Liebe war und sich J.C. nicht für June Carter schämte, sondern sie auf der Bühne immefort ermutigte. Wie kein anderer hat er es hingenommen, dass er 20 Jahre nicht wahrgenommen wurde, ohne dem Alkohol zu verfallen oder die Familie zu zerstören. Am Ende hat er uns allen seine Zerbrechlikeit und seinen Verfall vorgelebt und  bis zum Schlus gearbeitet. Etwas ähnliches sah man nur Jahre später beim öffentlichen Tod des Papstes Johannes Pauls. Wie dieser sich sterbenskrank mit zerfallener ohne Scheu kurz am Fenster des Vatikans gezeigt hatte, so hat auch Cash diesen Mut bewiesen.  Dieses Album ist wie alle aus der American Recordin Serie unglaublich schön. Schon der erste Titel taut einen auf. Man kann diesen Menschen nicht einfach nur- wie viele hier- mit Johnny anquatschen."
2,"in seinem Schloss... da kann ihm unter anderem auch sein Hund zuhören - frei nach seiner eigenen Einschätzung, wo er mit seiner Musik mal enden wird. Aber Spaß beiseite... Natürlich ist es Stings gutes Recht, mal was ganz anderes zu machen. Und es ist mein gutes Recht, es nicht zu kaufen. Ich bin schon beim Probehören hier bei Amazon fast eingenickt. Sowas würde ich nicht ein ganzes Album durchhalten, sorry. Nur Laute und viktorianisches Alt-Englisch, was man als Deutscher noch nicht mal gut versteht? Nee, lieber Sting! Möge Dich dieses Album inspiriert und motiviert haben - ich warte dann lieber auf das nächste ""echte"" Sting-Album!"
1,"Als sehr großer Kiss Fan seit dem Destroyer Album (1976) mit ""Shout it out loud"", ""Beth"" und Detroit Rock City"" und dem Dynasty Album (1979) mit ""I was made for lovin you"" hatte ich auch immer eine Vorliebe für Paul Stanley und seinen Gesang. Sein erstes Solo Album hat mir sehr gut gefallen (besonders die Songs ""Tonight you belong to me""  ""Take me away "" und besonders natürlich ""Hold me touch me""). Auch wenn es viele Kiss-Fans nicht hören mögen, so fand ich insbesondere das Album The Elder (1981) mit ""Just a boy"", ""Under the rose"" und ""A world without heroes""  klasse. Es war musikalisch ausgesprochen wertvoll, weil man einfach mal neue Wege ausprobiert hat, was keiner von Kiss erwartet hätte. Leider hat sich Kiss nach The Elder in den letzten 20 Jahren fast nur noch dem Hard Rock zugewandt. Seitdem gefällt mir die Musik nur noch selten; gut fand ich z.B. noch ""Reason to live"" und ""I still love you"". Lange hatte ich darauf gehofft, daß Paul Stanley ein weiteres Solo- Album herausbringt und war natürlich sehr neugierig als nun ""Live to win"" erschienen ist. Als ich dann die Songs durchgehört habe, war ich sehr enttäuscht. Mir gefällt eigentlich kein einziger Song. Die Melodien gehen mir nicht ins Ohr, es ist nichts was einen berührt. Alles klingt ähnlich, sehr nach Kiss der letzten Jahre eben. Kiss und Paul Stanley sollten wieder mehr Neues wagen und nicht nur auf den Hard Rock setzen. Auch bei Popsongs, Balladen und andere Musikrichtungen können sie richtig gut sein. Bis dahin -Live to win- Paul und mach`s gut!!!"
4,"Auf seiner vierten Veröffentlichung für Blue Note spielt G.Green klassischen Jazz der 1960er Jahre. Markenzeichen dieser CD aus dem Jahre 1961 ist sein seelenvolles, bluesorientiertes und melodiöses Spiel. Bei dieser Session spielen Yusef Lateef( ts,fl ), ""Brother"" Jack McDuff ( org ) und Al Harewood ( dr ), welche für den nötigen Drive, Swing und Abwechslung sorgen. Anspieltip ist der Miles Davis Klassiker ""My Funny Valentine"". Schönes stimmungvolles Album."
5,"Die Erarbeitung des Zappa-Katalogs ist ein langwieriges und kostspieliges Unterfangen, zumal es kaum Alben gibt, von deren Kauf man kategorisch abraten könnte. Der Einsteiger findet mit der YCDTOSA-Reihe eine gute Möglichkeit, sich einen Überblick über sämtliche Schaffensperioden des Meisters auf den Player zu holen. Dieser erste Teil bietet meiner Meinung nach auch gleich die größte Vielfalt. Hier ist einfach soviel unterschiedliches Zeug drauf, dass man gar nicht weiß, wohin mit seiner Begeisterung. Das berühmte ""Don't Eat The Yellow Snow"" ist allerdings so ziemlich das Highlight, nebst Publikumsverarsche und nahezu unglaublichen musikalischen und gesanglichen Leistungen einer Band, deren Mitglieder beim Auftritt fast alle von fiesen Infektionen geplagt wurden. Phänomenal. Für Zappa-Fans ist die komplette Sammlung eh Pflicht, alle Klassiker sind in 13 Stunden versammelt, und alle in sonst nicht erhältlichen Versionen, die teilweise erheblich vom Original abweichen. Unbedingte Kaufempfehlung!"
2,Diese Einspielung war sicherlich zu ihrer Zeit ein Meisterwerk - und vom künstlerischen ist sie es höchstwahrscheinlich auch heute noch. Jedoch ist es sehr schwer der Aufnahme wirklich zu folgen - das remastering ist in meinem Geschmack nicht gelungen und so hört sich alles sehr matt und flach an. Da gibt es heute wesentlich bessere Aufnahmen mit mehr Hörgenuss!
5,"Ich war sehr überrascht als ein neues Prodigy Album heraus kam. Noch begeisteter war ich als ich das Album zum ersten mal gehört habe. Einfach nur geil. Richtig coole fette Beats. Ich habe noch kein Stück gefunden, welches mir nicht gefällt. Was ich aber echt schon bescheurt finde ich das riesen große FSK 16 Logo auf der Verpackung. Schade das es bei Amzon nicht so abgebildet ist, aber was soll man da auch schon machen. Der Kauf hat sich gelohnt, kann ich nur weiterempfehlen."
2,"Was ist diese Platte nicht in den Himmel gelobt worden. Die exquisite Besetzungsliste scheint kaum einen anderen Schluss zuzulassen, als daß es sich hier nur um ein exorbitantes Meisterwerk handeln kann. Mike Bloomfield, Buddy Miles, Harvey Brooks, Nick Gravenites, Richie Havens - alles große Namen.  Leider klingt das ganze aber keineswegs zeitlos sondern einfach nur altmodisch und wie ein typisches Produkt der Endsechziger. Nichts gegen sinnvolle Bläserakzente, aber das bis zum Erbrechen in jedem Stück überpräsente Bigband-Gepuste wirkt plakativ und nervend, es nimmt der Musik mehr an Schärfe als es ihr an neuer Energie zuführt. Als Live-Act mag das anders gewirkt haben, aber wir sprechen ja hier über eine Tonkonserve. Nach den ersten Nummern wartet man ständig darauf, daß nach witzig gemeintem Vorgeplänkel endlich der richtige Wumms kommt, irgendetwas wirklich beeindruckendes - Fehlanzeige. Trotz der instrumental mehr als ausreichenden Fähigkeiten der Musiker verbleibt das Material im gefälligen Mainstream, ""Groovin' is Easy - if you know how"" heißt es im zweiten Stück -  tja, wenn man nur wüßte wie. ""Another Country"", das vorletzte Stück, hat ein bißchen mehr Drive und Abwechslung, bringt aber in der Mitte eine völlig aus der Luft gegriffene  Latin-Rock-Einlage, quasi Prä-Santana (zugegeben, ohnehin nicht mein Ding). Überhaupt scheint das Klassenziel dieses Albums gewesen zu sein, möglichst viel des gesamten Wissens und Könnens dieser aus schwarzen und weißen Muskern bestehenden Band mit aller Gewalt hineinzustopfen. Das zweifelsfrei beste Stück ist das nicht mal eine Minute lange ""Easy Rider"", quasi die Auslaufrille. Authentischer, stiller Blues, der weitergehen möchte, zum ""Runterkommen"" nach diesem ganzen Lärm aber leider nicht ausreicht. Über seine Musik schreibt Mike Bloomfield im Covertext: ""...I think of it as the music you hear in the air, on the air, and in the streets; blues, soul, country, rock, religious music, traffic, crowds, street sounds and field sounds, the sound of people and silence."" Musik, die also jeden ansprechen will und von allem  etwas verwurstet. Sowas bringt nun mal bestenfalls Mainstream, und nichts besonderes, das die Zeiten überdauert. Bitte erst reinhören, bloß nicht blind kaufen !"
2,"ein hauptkaufgrund dürfte für viele menschen wohl die erwartung sein, auf der zweiten cds interessante jams zu finden. aber leider fehlanzeige. selten so ödes gegniedel gehört. vergleicht man einmal, was eine band wie lifetime zur selben zeit in der der gleichen besetzung vorgelegt hat, ist das geschrammel von clapton winwood und baker doch arg enttäuschend. auch das remastering der offiziellen lp ist nich vom feinsten."
2,"Ich bin seit 1978 UFO/Michael Schenker Fan und habe natürlich alle UFO und MSG-Alben. Seit ""Walk On Water"", ""Written In The Sand"" und ""The Michael Schenker Story live""  ging es für mich eigentlich mit Schenker nur bergab. Erst hat er UFO runtergewirtschaftet, dann teilweise parallel MSG. Alle Alben nach ""Written In The Sand"" fielen durch schlechte Produktion auf. Zudem gab es neben einigen Supersongs viel Füllmaterial. Die Krönung war, dass bei Arachnophobiac wegen Ausnüchterungskur des Protagonisten ein fremder Gitarrist einige Soli spielte. Nichts desto trotz war die Freude groß, als Ende 2004 das soeben erschienene Album für das Frühjahr 2005 (!) angekündigt wurde. Das es dann ein Jahr länger auf sich warten ließ, mußte ja bedeuten, dass es sehr gut werden wird. Die von mir bei AOL geladene Maxi-CD ""Revolution Mind"" bestätigte dann meine Hoffnung. Das war's dann aber auch. Ich habe ""Tales Of Rock'n'Roll nun insgesamt 5mal gehört, in der Hoffnung, dass es dann  Klick macht - anspruchsvollere Musik muß man halt öfter hören. Aber es passiert nichts. Der Sänger gefällt mir nicht, er bringt zu selten guten Melodiebögen rüber (die Sänger waren für mich bei MSG immer das Hauptübel - ist allerdings rein subjektiv) und die Vielzahl der Songs ist ohne Leben und zudem ist der Sound bei den meisten Songs steril und knochentrocken. Für mich ragt eigentlich nur ""Big Deal"" aus dem Brei heraus. Dann gibt es noch 2, 3 weitere Songs die O.K. sind, aber was soll der Rest sein? Unter dem Eindruck dieses Albums hätte ich mir die Karten für das Konzert in Oberhausen nicht gekauft."
5,"Auch diese wundervoll entspannt-mystische CD fällt nicht aus dem gewohnt hohen Qualitätsniveau, das man von Popol Vuh immer erwarten durfte. Auffallend ist die Tendenz zu exotischen Instrumenten und Stimmungen, die die kontemplative Klangwelt der Vuhs um neue Farben bereichert. Wer das meiste von der Gruppe liebt, wird auch hier völlig glücklich! Gruß und viel Freude damit!"
4,"Besser kann man diese Compilation wohl nicht beschreiben als mit der Überschrift. Diese 1995 bei Amphetamine Records (Helmets erstem Label) erschienene Compilation enthält neben der Original ""Born Annoying""-EP (bestehend aus der 89er-Version ""Born Annoying"" und ""Rumble"") die zur selben Zeit entstandenen unveröffentlichten Tracks ""Shirley Maclaine"" und ""Geisha to Go"". Desweiteren finden sich viele B-Seiten und unveröffentlichte Tracks der Band aus der Zeitspanne 1990-1993. Die einzigen Titel die mir persönlich fehlen sind das Gigantor-Cover und das Black Sabbath-Cover ""Symptom of the Universe"", aber das ist verschmerzbar. Was man hier zum Großteil geboten kriegt sind typische Helmet-B-Seiten. Und trotzdem erstaunt es wie großartig und eingängig manche Lieder sind obwohl sie es auf kein Album geschafft haben. ""Rumble"" und ""Shirley Maclaine"" beispielsweise sind meiner Meinung nach trotz primitiver Spielweise schon frühe Großtaten Helmets, die sich perfekt zum Headbangen eignen. Gleiches gilt für das sehr simple aber umso effektivere ""Taken"". Selbst Lieder wie ""Your Head"" und ""No Nicky No"" sind für B-Seiten verhältnisse überraschend gut. Auch das Melvins-Cover ""Oven"" und das Killing Joke-Cover ""Primitive"" sind gelungen. Und die 1993 Updated Version von ""Born Annoying"" lässt nur noch verbrannte Erde zurück und zählt zu meinen Favourites von Helmet. Titelbewertung: Born Annoying (1989) 4/5 Rumble 5/5 Shirley Maclaine 5/5 Geisha to Go 3/5 Taken 5/5 Your Head 4/5 Oven 4/5 No Nicky No 4/5 Primitve 5/5 Born Annoying (1993) 5/5 Für eine B-Seiten-Compilation macht diese CD unwahrscheinlich viel Spaß. Einiges hat sicher nicht ganz das Niveau was man sonst von Helmet gewohnt ist und dennoch überwiegen die positiven Eindrücke und man kriegt über eine halbe Stunde lang was auf die Zwölf. Für Helmet-Fans absolut empfehlenswert! ps: Meine Rezension bezieht sich auf Helmet ""Born Annoying"" und nicht auf ein Album namens ""Ameisenstaat"" von einer deutschen Punkrockband. ;)"
1,"Das Problem an der ganzen Sache ist das, dass die Musik ebenso einfältig klingt, wie die Interpretin in Interviews wirkt. Da hilft auch keine ""Limited Deluxe Edition"" das ist und bleibt musikalischer Plunder in seiner verwerflichsten Form. Selbst wenn man an Musik nur niedrigste Ansprüche stellt, muss man angesichts eines solchen Albums vor Schreck erbleichen."
5,"Charakterstark, mit Nachdruck und Persönlichkeit, dabei die feingliedrigen Verästelungen nicht unterschlagend. Für mich das beste Alice-Album. Gehört mit ""Park Hotel"", ""Il sole nella pioggia"" und ""Charade"" zu den stärksten Alben, die italienische Musik je hervorgebracht hat. Wer einem früheren David Sylvian (bis inkl. ""Beehive"" ) nicht abgeneigt ist oder auch einen Battiato, Gabriel oder eine Kate Bush zu seinen Favoriten zählt, der kommt an Alices Musik sowieso nicht vorbei. Die Liste der beteiligten Musiker ist dabei wieder einmal das Sahnehäubchen: Gavin Harrison an den Drums, Danny Thompson am Kontrabass, Paolo Fresu an der Trompete, Richard Barbieri an den Keyboards, dazu Jakko Jakszyk, die langjährigen Wegbegleiter Francesco Messina &amp; Pino Pischetola uva. Das Ergebnis ist ein herbstlich-melancholisches, introvertiertes Album, das unter die Haut geht. Der Begriff der ""Pop-Musik"" ist hier nicht anzuwenden, denn ""Mezzogiorno sulle alpi"", also dieser Mittags-Spaziergang durch die Alpen, hat damit längst nichts mehr zu tun. In höchstem Maße empfehlenswert !"
4,"Echte Techno-Fans sind ohnehin schon Dean's Beatz &amp; Soundz verfallen, aber auch Neuankömmlinge im Genre werden von seinem neuestem Werk begeistert sein. Auch wenn keine Bonus-DVD das ohnehin erstklassige Teil aufpeppen würde, ist es eindeutig ein 'Must-Have'."
2,"... wäre sicherlich bei vielen Bands ein guter Schritt. Wenn es denn richtig gemacht wird. Doch leider gibt es bei Danzig ein Problem welches mir schon lange auffällt: Die Stimme wird immer schlechter, der Gesang in den Melodien immer weinerlicher. Über die Qualität der Songs auf ""Circle of Snakes"" kann man nicht meckern, doch zünden sie nicht richtig aufgrund der fehlenden Gesangsleistung. Und das Danzig selbst bei der Produktion der CD zurück in die Vergangenheit geht (man denke nur an Samhain's ""Initium"" oder gar den Original Misfits Scheiben) musste wohl wirklich nicht sein. Neben dem lächerlichen Cover und den noch lächerlichen bis gar peinlichen Inlayfotos bleiben bei ""Circle of Snakes"" nur gute Songs und gute Instrumentalarbeit die durch die Produktion und der nicht vorhandenen Stimme abgewertet werden."
2,"Ich oute mich nun mal... als eigentlichen Fan von Dieter-Bohlen-Songs. Bin seit Urzeiten Modern Talking-Fan und mag diese Musik einfach. Eigentlich...Leider hat sich der Stil von Herrn Bohlen in den letzten 6 Jahren für mich persönlich sehr zum Negativen geändert. ( seit dem letzten MT-Album und dem Start von DSDS) Alles ist so austauschbar und beliebig geworden. Dieses spiegelt sich auch diesem Werk wieder. ""Anything but love"" gefällt mir noch recht gut, melodisch, gefühlvoll, eingängig. Die beiden Coverversionen sind auch sehr gut gelungen und dann bleiben bei mir nur noch ""Emily"" und ""Nothing's gonna change it"" im Gehörgang hängen. Alles andere ist Einheitsbrei, langweilig und rauscht völlig ohne Emotionen zu wecken an mir vorbei. Das ""Schlimmste"" für mich ist aber, das mehrere Songs bereits auf anderen Alben von anderen Interpreten (Natalie Tineo, Filmmusik zu ""Dieter-Der Film) vertreten sind und hier von Herrn Bohlen nur mit anderen Texten und Arrangements versehen wurden. Das finde ich total schade. Hätte ""man"" sich für das Album nicht etwas mehr Zeit nehmen können und etwas hochwertigeres Material komponieren können ? Das Potential bei Daniel Schumacher ist doch vorhanden (Stimme, Mädchenschwarm, nette Aussstrahlung). Aber da wird dann ein ""Werk"" aus dem Boden gestampft und darauf gehofft das die meisten nicht merken wie zusammengeklaut alles ist. Dieses bemerken nur die eingefleischten Fans, die so ziemlich alles aus dem Hause Bohlen besitzen. Tja, schade.. aber dasselbe passiert ja auch bei Mark Medlock. Dieses ist die letzte CD für mich gewesen die ich ohne reinzuhören gekauft habe. ""Früher"" konnte ich mich bei Bohlen-Produktionen immer darauf verlassen das ich das mag und es bei mir rauf- und runterläuft. Diese Zeiten sind anscheinend (leider) vorbei.  Zwei Sterne trotzdem für Stimme und den sympathischen Daniel Schumacher :-)"
1,"kennen sie noch die werbung 'wir sehen uns jeden mist an, damit, sie keinen mist sehn müssen'? genau das trifft auch hier zu, nur haben wir es hier mit sogennanter musik zu tun. ob unser deutscher superstar nr. 1 alexander k. singen kann? nein, das seh ich nicht so. aber da stehen mir ja millionen von leuten gegenüber, deshalb wird diese tatsache mal ein wenig zur seite geschoben. alexander blüht keine rosige zukunft, wenn es so weiter geht. er steht im schatten von dieter bohlen, und er hört sich auch genauso an. das ist nicht verwunderlich, denn jeder weiß ja, wer die lieder komponiert bzw. konzepiert. und ist das ein beweiß für qualität. ehrlich gesagt, nein, eher das gegenteil, und so hört sich das album auch an. alles klingt gleich. gleich langweilig, gleich unkreativ und gleich schlecht, nicht zu vergessen die unheimlich schlechten texte aus bohlens hand, da aber ein großteil der dsds-fans sowieso nicht über besonders gute englischkenntnisse verfügt brauchen die texte auch gar keinen sinn zu haben. die hauptsache ist nur, dass wörter enthalten sind, die auch fünftklässler perfekt verstehen, also sowas wie 'baby', 'girl' oder dergleichen. jetzt wieder zurück zu alexanders stimme. wie gesagt, ich denke er kann nicht singen, aber das ist hier auch völlig irrelevant, da seine stimme sowieso in den abgründen der kompositionen verschwindet. im grunde werden einem also nur die 08/15 melodien von bohlen, die wir schon seit ewigkeiten ertragen müssen aufgezwungen und es überrascht wirklich keinen, dass diese cd kein bisschen anspruch besitzt. meine bitte: finger weg, denn selbst für eingefleischte alexander-fans wird diese cd kein vergnügen sein, ganz zu schweigen von denen, die sowieso schon immer was gegen pseudomusik wie diese etwas hatten."
1,"Der Name des Songs ist leider Programm. Im Vergleich zu den sonstigen talentfreien Castingsternchen schaffen es die Mädels ja sogar halbwegs ordentlich einen Ton zu treffen, aber zu viel mehr reicht es bei Ihnen dann leider auch wieder nicht. Ein extrem schwacher Song, von drei konturlosen Interpretinnen, wer braucht so etwas ?"
