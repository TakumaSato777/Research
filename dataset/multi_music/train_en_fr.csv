2,"This is not what I expected from such a gifted artist as Jaheim, did he change producers? The music and the man with the voice didn't go together well for me.  This is one I will not be purchasing, it is a serious down grade from his previous two albums. Better luck next time, Jaheim I was truly disappointed."
1,"This is not the music from the movie. This purchase was a Major dissapointment. You would do beter searching for the music credits for titles, then download the tracks form your music subscriber"
1,"Get's one star in appreciation of the technicians who had to record the cd. What a mess! Never should have been made. Even Julie is way past the point of playing this onstage. She half talks her way through her songs, her voice clearly not what it was when she made the film. Sorry Julie, should have left it alone.  The rest of the cast is not on a par with the film. Tony Roberts in place of Robert Preston...not on his best day. Leslie Ann Warren was riotuosly original in the film, Rachel York trying to copy her, is not. And Michael Nouri? Dismal. The songs added to the score for the stage.......forget it. Not even worth mentioning any more. Goes into the WHAT WERE THEY THINKING? file. As for Julie refusing her Tony nomination because the rest of the show was overlooked? C'mon Julie, there was a reason for that, the show SUCKED!"
1,"Layla is one of the most overrated songs of all time. Cream is one of the most boring bands in history. Why not do yourself a favour and buy enjoyable bands like Dire Straits, and Metallica who rock.  PS.This Clapton compilation has no good songs so please don't buy it at all"
1,"I don't understand the previous reviews - I found this recording positively dreadful, with Ruthie Henshall being the only one worth listening to. John Sinclair is abominable as George - he sounds like he's doing a (bad) imitation of Michael Crawford in &quot;Hello, Dolly.&quot; He does strange things to his words - I guess he's trying not to sound British, but why is he singing &quot;Summ-ar weath-ar&quot; instead of &quot;summer weather&quot;?    The Ilona is a bass - almost literally. &quot;I Resolve&quot; has been lowered for her, and yet she still cannot master the range of the song. To accomodate her, the second part of &quot;I Don't Know His Name&quot; has a truly odd key change. Were she remotely talented I could understand key changes to facilitate her singing, but she's not worth it.    The orchestrations are odd, too, with strange sleigh bell sounds appearing frequently. The rest of the singers range from fair (Kodaly - a pretty voice but not much expression) to bad (Mr. Maraczek drags down EVERY SINGLE NOTE of &quot;Days Gone By.&quot; Luckily this is his only song.)    The Broadway revival, to my ear, still has the best voices, except, of course, that Barbara Cook (the original) outshines Diane Fratantoni, who is merely good (but who was a vast improvement over the Roundabout's original Amalia, the annoying Judy Kuhn.)     Get the original or revival recordings instead - this London version I would recommend only to die-hard SHE LOVES ME fans, or masochists. I'd rather sit through another terrible viewing of &quot;You've Got Mail&quot; than listen to this again"
1,"When I think of the sex pistols, I think the Monkeys did it better as a boy band. Let's face it, dears, that is all the sex pistols were: a marketing ploy. They are f-----g NSync for another generation"
2,This collection of 15 great hits of Nicola Di Bari in spanish is missing one of his most (if not the most) important and popular song: &quot;Lisa de los ojos azules&quot;. I wouldn't buy this CD without that song
1,"I can't fathom why anyone would enjoy this album. The lyrics must have come out of a Dadaist poetry circle, and (most of) the guitar work is completely without personality.  What is the criterion of a good rock album? By any standards it must be a joy to play it. 6teen Stone misses the mark by such dimensions one must assume it was intentional. But it doesn't so much incite anger than it does disdain for Bush's attempts to emulate Nirvana. Where Nirvana has clearly enunciated guitar riffs and minimalist, evocative lyrics, Bush has dull, throbbing guitar drones that project nothing to the listener but a kind of malaise-inspired anger.  There's not much more to say about 6teen Stone. I could tell you about the embarrassment of listening to the lyrics on songs like ""Swim"": Thinning ice / 14 Hairdryers / Swimming to you / Flame on earth desire."" Or the artistic suicide of the last track, ""X-Girlfriend"", a song composed of a little guitar-wailing and a non-stop chorus that's about six words long.  That's about all I can tell you. Mostly I figure I've done enough warning to let you make your own choice. If you do attempt this though, you ought to be told the little good news that there is: there are about 5 minutes of good music are contained on the album, split between ""Machinehead"" and ""Glycerine."" The first is an energetic, well-constructed song about control (you might have seen the music video for it about 11 years ago on Total Request Live), the second a serenade featuring over-dubbed guitars, a trembling cello, and a surprisingly coherent Rossdale. They hold the album; about as well as a couple of floor joists can hold a crumbling building."
1,There is a reason why you cannot listen to any tracks on Amazon- you wouldn't buy if you could. I read a number of reviews and figured that it was worth a try given that Metallica was mentioned as being similar in some small way. This band is nothing even near Metallica. I have thrown the disk away- don't bother
2,"I've always seen Sheryl Crow as a middle-of-the-road rock artist.   My wife and I got a couple of her disc's, plus that ""very best of"" CD and was really looking forward to her latest, but this one...zzzzzzzz, makes me wonder what they're putting in Sheryl's coffee.   Some reviewers are saying there's ""heart and soul"" all over this album?  That may be, but it's also very slick dullsville stuff too.   As for the album cover graphics, I don't see the Roger Dean Yes covers or the 60's style psychedelia like one reviewer wrote, but a very ""modern"" graphic art that lots of artists and bands have been using. Kelly Clarkson, the Vines, the Donnas, the list goes on.  Highlights: Good is Good (I guess it's time for a new ""very best of"" collection)"
1,Please change your name to (KID RAP)..  When you start producing true ROCK cd's then and only then you should put rock back into your fake name...  Stop playing both sides..  I realize that the rap- hip hop scene is much easier because over half the fan base is little girls /boys and people that dont have a clue what music is all about..  Do yourself a favor and take the rap/hip hop out of your so called music. One day you will realize that the rap/hip hop scene is like a bad smell that real music fans hate and wish would go away..          
1,When will amazon allow a zero stars rating????
1,"If you have children that are five years & younger, this would be a good album to put in your child's boom box or get it in cassette for their tape player.  but if your children are six and up.  Your better off finding the real songs and burning them if you can find these songs.  This album should be saved strictly for the poor folks who wnat music for their kids but cannot afford it.  This ablum would be number 1 if it were sold in Rwanda, Sudan or other third world nations since it could be sold for like dirt cheap.  Parents, if you buy this album, after your children turn 6 years old.  pack this CD and other Ki8dz Bop CD's and send them to Africa.  This is Pop music for impoverished folks"
2,"Ok, first off, this is the first Corrs release i've listenend to. I'm offering my opinion without knowing anything else they may have done. I've listened to the cd 10 times or so, on random occasions when i need a break from my normal diet of punk and garage rock.  It sounds good. A little TOO good. I agree that it's overproduced, doesn't sound even remotely spontaneous. The studio work is well done, but OVERdone. I'd like to hear something else to see what they REALLY sound like.  The content of the songs is what bothers me. Aside from being sappy, sentimental drivvel (this is pop music, after all - i wasn't expecting anything else), everything sounds like a commercial ditty or a part of a movie soundtrack. Mmm-hmm.  Track 1 - I see a not-so overweight soccermom smiling on a treadmill at Curves(TM), then hopping in the Ford Expedition(TM), and cheering on the kids at their soccer game with a SunnyD(TM) in each hand.  Track 2 - Helicopter pans out as mid-20's girl drives curvy mountain road in VW Cabrio(TM)(R) with top down, thinking about handsome lover... ""LMN""(R) watermark in lower-right corner of screen...  Track 3 - Sad animals. Images of puppys in cages.  Track 4 - Actually, I like this one. Mellow, laid back.  Track 5 - Ugh.  Track 6 - This one is the MOST clever! I see the band members - 3 girls, 1 guy - on one side of a table under a hanging lamp in an otherwise black room, while 3 gentlemen in suits open a breifcase full of money, push it towards them and say, ""As you're aware, the radio has lost it's credibility. The kids are figuring out that there are other bands out there, beside what we pump across the airwaves at them. We need to entice them back. If you want a single, and this pile of cash says you do, then you'll do what you can to save this dying medium. Hell, you work in the word ""radio"" and we'll double what we're giving you."" Come on, the song even SOUNDS like a PSA for the International Radio Marketing Council...  Track 7 - Sounds like a Pepsi commercial.  Track 8 - Ugh. Wait, wasn't this Track 5?  Track 9 - Sappy, but ok. Sounds like they actually put effort into the lyrics. Thumbs up.  Track 10 - Not remotely original, but alright.  Track 11 - Interesting sound. Good beat. Correct me if i'm worng, but was that a semi-Pagan reference there? That would be a bold move, for which i'd applaud them, if in fact it is. Not that i'm Pagan or anything, but hey, its a religiously positive, non-Christian reference that doesn't involve Marilyn Manson, and that takes guts. Especially for radio-loving girls bands.  Track 12 - Laid back. Almost has a jazzy, lounge feel.  Track 13 - Produced by former Ace of Base member? Bubbly, upbeat, not too bad.  Track 14 - Written and produced by Avril Lavigne...  Track 15 - WOW! A RELATIVELY CELTIC-SOUNDING SONG FROM A RELATIVELY CELTIC BAND!! And instrumental, too - big thumbs up! In fact, maybe that's the key.  Whatever. Long-winded, i know, but fair. This album didn't turn me off to the Corrs completely, but i don't have very high hopes now.  Flame away, kiddies."
2,"I live in Buffalo and I'm a big prog rock fan; so when I saw this CD at the library, I knew I had to give it a free listen.   But make no mistake - this CD under-delivers on many levels.    I always wanted Asia to be a great band - it had my favorite guitar player (Steve Howe), a top-shelf drummer (Carl Palmer), and a proven bass player/vocalist who was up to the task (John Wetton).  But there was always a bit too much ""pop"", simplicity and repetition in their music to totally engage me.  Hey, progressive rock is mostly about ""different"", complexity and change, right?  Asia was a progressive-pop band (akin to the later albums of Todd Rundgren's Utopia) that made good music, but didn't really pioneer much of anything.    Same with this CD.  There's little here that's new or better than the studio versions of the songs.  Palmer's long drum solo got boring after a while.  Steve's acoustic solos can be found on other Yes recordings, and done much better there  -  here, the recording quality is so bad that it sounds like he's playing tuned rubber bands at times.  (Honestly, I remember hearing better fidelity from my old Kenner Close'n'Play!)  O.K., it WAS cool to hear Steve express his pleasure at playing in Buffalo again!  But the so-called ""keyboard solo"" by Geoff Downs was underwhelming to say the least, and reinforced my suspicion that he was sort of the weak link in this group of otherwise great prog virtuosos.    I guess if one loves a band too much, they can blindly overlook some shortcomings on almost any CD by that band, and that's just fine for those people.  However, the OBJECTIVE reality of this CD's value comes creeping in on many other's existing reviews:  namely, the production quality is sub-par (to the point of being annoying at times); the vocals and harmonies are often off-key (you really shouldn't have to wince this much during 79 minutes of music!); this is clearly a single disk album that was issued on 2 disks for some reason; the packaging and liner notes are scant; and the performance just doesn't add much to the studio versions.  This is for Asia completists only.    Asia did make a solid 5-star progressive-pop CD with their first studio album.  I love it.  But they never improved upon it, and never stretched out into new territory.  Perhaps this 1982 live recording exposes some of the weaknesses that kept this potential supergroup from going from ""good"" to ""great"".    Support your local library.  (And in this case, save some cash!)"
1,"Their new stuff is even worse. But this is still sexist, boring, annoying music at its worst. There are much better artists out there, so why listen to these two untalented rappers"
2,"Can this be the same D-12 that packed in witty rhymes in a non-serious demeaner? Well, I guess this really does prove they are only a side-show. Eminem has different production, so the group will have different production. Eminem went more serious, now the group is more serious.   Besides that, Shady himself (or what is left of what he use to be) is basically a no-show. In any track Eminem's in, it's usually the strongest, and that is the case here; However, that doesn't mean he was great. That means the CD itself is misconfusion, contradiction, and a side-show for Eminem's next CD (""Encore"", which was better then this, but not that great overall, as well).   D-12 is the commercials to the Eminem Show, everyone's just waiting to get in between them. That's the case here"
1,"After hearing ""I'm N Luv (Wit a Stripper)"" I don't know why anyone would want to buy and listen to this CD in its entirety. I'm not going to type a bunch of long paragraphs about why this CD sucks. This CD is a waste and T-Pain is illiterate. There! I said it in one sentence. Holllaaa"
1,"First of all FLOETIC was a brilliant album and after I heard SUPERSTAR on the radio I thought FLO'OLOGY was going to be a classic too. I was wrong. This album lacks originality, its inferior to be precise. The first time I popped this CD into the system, I found myself being friends with the skip forward button. The length of the records is despicable   This CD is not worth having....the only track that stands out for me is SUPERSTAR and I think COMMON is amazing"
1,I am at a loss to hear what people appreciate about this CD.  We were barely able to make it through one listening.  This is a classic example of a CD that NEVER would have been produced had the artist (using the term very loosely) not already been famous for something besides music.  The lack of talent and originality on this CD is apalling.  It only gets a star because that's the lowest rating.  I want my money back
2,"This is anything but soothing. The tone is too high pitched; nothing like the deep bass of crashing waves along the rocky Carmel coastline that I was hoping for. I did buy the twofer and got the Ocean Surf CD by Dan Gibson and found it much more relaxing, even though it isn't a tumbling surf sound. I was able to fall asleep... which was my goal. Now if I could only return Ocean Waves."
1,"Thankfully I checked this out of the library and did not spend money on it.  I felt the need to add a review though to spare those who might be thinking of buying it.  I made it through the CD once with my kids, but that was it.  We will not be listening again.  As others have said, go buy the Radio Disney CDs (or possibly later version of KidzBop if they come with better reviews).  The singers (kids AND adults!)on KidzBob are out of tune and just painful to listen to.   "
1,"If you like early Priest, buy Genocide. It has both Rocka Rolla and Sad Wings of Destiny in their entirety(the only thing it does NOT have is the original album artwork). Not leaving out important tracks like The Ripper, for pete's sake!!! How could you leave out The Ripper? And what about Island of Domination? I feel sorry for anyone that bought this that is unfamiliar with Priest. They got jipped and didn't even know it. These are my favorite albums by Priest and I hate to see them butchered like this... And what about the order of the songs? Why would they mess with that too? Do youself a favor and buy either Genocide, or if you like to have the original artwork, buy Rocka Rolla and Sad wings of Destiny seperately"
1,"This is the perfect example of why black women and women in general are disrespected. Lil kim is teaching generations of women to be nasty as you can be and to disrespect yourself. Then to top all of this off she is still hanging on the coat tails of biggie, the ultra fantasy gangsta rapper. Queen latifah never had to talk like this to get her name out or to make good music. This is ridiculous! Kim would be better off in a porn movie than in the rap game. Please please please spare us and stop rapping"
2,"I LOVE Destiny's Child...BUT this CD...big disappointment. The best songs on the entire CD were probably Lose My Breath,Cater 2 U and Girl...big disappointment...i just wasnt feeling the CD when i bought it.."
2,"Some reviews have suggested that this is not the ideal first purchase for the un-inititiated.  I am writing to confirm that assertion.  I have read enough raving reviews about their subsequent releases to know that it really does get better from here, but what a disappointment this album was for me.  It sounds like what you would hear coming from the garage next door.  My advice to the kids would be to keep practing and please turn it down.  Jack's appreciation of the blues is admirable, but only realised on the song ""I Fought Piranhas"".  Tellingly, this is the final song on the album.  Otherwise the songs are forgettable and even annoying at times."
1,"There are only two artists' music that I will purchase not having heard one note of the CD. Those two artists are Barbra Streisand and Linda Eder. ""Songs of Judy Garland"" was a HUGE disappointment. I was surprised at the CD cover. I don't know what ""look"" Ms. Eder was shooting for but she missed the mark. Instead of coming off as 10 years younger, she has been transformed to the point of being unrecognizable. She looks both spooky and a little like a petulant child.  Ms. Eder has always been a very attractive woman and definitely did not need this kind of ""makeover"". And the music...I tried so many times to like it. But the more I listended the more I realized I was listening to ""Liza Minnelli"" singing her mother's music. I did not hear Linda Eder. I'm begging you Ms. Eder, go back to what works. I'm sorry...this doesn't"
1,"I have to disagree with the majority of folks here who consider this cd the jazz end all. I find it grating, and darn near unlistenable. I have built a small but quality jazz library the last few months. Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck, Kenny Burrell, Grant Green, Cannonball Adderley, Stan Getz, Chet Baker, Wes Montgomery, Bill Evans and Thelonius Monk to name a few. This guy is by far my least favorite. His playing on Miles Davis cd's I have and with Monk is largely enjoyable and I know he's a giant. But this stuff?. The live recording on disc two was so grating I couldn't make it through. It sounded to me like a bunch of Geese being slaughtered. Give me the other guys anytime"
2,"I was unable to play in my car CD player, so only choice I got is to listen at home using my home DVD player."
1,"Yep, this cd sucks. That Depeche Mode guy is really random, what makes you think anyone who is looking at the punk-o-rama review would be interested in Depeche Mode? REM sucks too, Michael Stipe is the most self absorbed old bald guy ever."
2,"This album is one of the only live albums that I don't have. I have heard samples, and a few extra songs on other cds though. The first thing I hear from somebody that tell about this album is basically that Stevie couldn't have been more high. His performance was just imbarrassing for the other members in the group (specifically Reese Wynans). Most poeple don't know this but, on the old vinyl copy of this album, (I've never heard it but someone told me) there was originally a 14th track. It was the song that usually comes close to the end of Stevie's sets. The song was Life Without You. Since it was the very last song, I'm guessing Stevie was more pooped than ever beacause it was the last song and that he was extremely high and everything. Being high is one thing, but being high and playing your last song in a set is terrible. In the old vinyl disc, Stevie was on his last song and he was so terribly slow that Reese Wynans walked off stage embarrased and discusted. This track was taken off the album because of its discracefulness"
2,"Bill Charlap is undoubtedly one of the most talented, lyrcially-blessed jazz pianiasts around today.  He has a deft touch and a senisbility that far exceeds his age and life experiences.  That told, I find it very hard to give his latest effort, Stardust, more than two stars.  With very few exceptions, I found this CD to be fairly self-indulgent and Charlap rather morose in his intrepretations. It wasn't nearly a refeshing to the ear as Written in the Stars.  I would recommend this for a Charlap devotee but no one else.  He has made better albums"

2,"The restoration of a Vivaldi opera must be a commendable effort specially if filling in big voids and rebuilding major missing parts of the masterpiece. Motezuma is such an example where ample musical and artistic license was taken to bring it to life. Like restoring a canvas where not only the colors and forms had faded but also sizeable parts were ripped off and lost, reconstructing Motezuma presents the challenge for the restorer of thinking and dreaming, and becoming as inspired as Vivaldi. In listening to Motezuma, one can pick up the original Vivaldian compositions from the reconstructed material as clear as looking at a combination painting part Picasso part Michelangelo. As much as such painting can be taxing to the eye, portions of this opera can be as disappointing to the ear. Except for several arias and the two sinfonias, the music has a touch and taste of the 1800's, but not of the baroque settecento. The juxtaposition of the restorative style is also distractive, and just does not work. It makes at times the orchestration devoid of the Vivaldi unf , charm, and texture.   Nonetheless, Motezuma's musical beauty can be found in great arias such as D'ira e Furor Armato, La Figlia Lo Sposo, Gl'otraggi della Sorte, D'ove La Figlia?, S'impugni La Spada, and performances by Vito Priante, Inga Kalna, and Marijana Mijanovic. Bravo for Vito Priante and his interpretation of GI'otraggi della Sorte, and D'ove la Figlia. He does a great ornamentation in the da capos, and turns up the volume in all the right notes. Just like ""Terribile lo Sento"", and ""Orribile lo Scempio"", ""GI'otraggi"" shares the same musicalization. Somehow, this version of the score is especially more dramatic and  subtlely more melodic. "
2,"Well, unless you are a hardcore collector like myself (had it originally on vinyl all those years ago), stay clear of this album. If you want to hear noise that you & your wife/girlfriend/boyfriend could do yourself, then forget this album & make your own noise. The best track on the album is the bonus track. That tells you that this album has nothing to do with Beatles music. I give it one star for being terrible & one star for the packaging ;-).    Search Judemac Forever"" on msn"

1,"I don't see the comparison to Jeff Buckley AT ALL! That was a singer who had more talent in his little pinky than this band has on the entire album. All the songs are much too similar, the guy's voice gets boring to listen to after a while and, if you remember London Suede, has a very similar sound to them (though I will say that London Suede was MUCH better). No one has come close to the pipes of J. Buckley (or even Tim B., for that matter) in years and this doesn't count any where near that, either"
1,"i feel that a lot of bands were good in the 90's. this band was one of them. while yes, they were a bit poppy and sellout-ish on americana and conspiracy, they still had enough bad@ss in them to put on a rad song.  i think they should have just did a ""da hui"" single with ""the noose"" and maybe ""cant get my head around you"" on it. this sucks really bad. it makes the average conspiracy of one look like a bad religion album!! if you must hear, download or borrow.  please guys. quit or make good music. its pretty pathetic hearing ""hit that"" next to the godawful creed and nickelbland!!  so we go from a punk-ish hard rock band that is inspired by TSOL and The Damned and plays punk shows with pennywise to this...a corporate radio rock album that is loved by teenybopper frat boys and the mtv mindless"
2,"As a contemporary of Joan Baez (age-wise), I loved her early music and the power of her incredible voice.  I even empathize with much of her politics, but unfortunately it's time she rested on her laurels.  Her voice on this CD is quite far removed from what she was once capable of, and in fact I would have to say that there is no comparison between her vocal ability on Bowery Songs, and her earlier quality.  Like some professional athletes, she seems to not know when to quit..."
2,"I just purchased my sacd player and picked up Boston and Billy Joel's the Stranger at the same time.  After listening to the Stranger, my mouth dropped.  Billy's voice coming from the center speaker and all the other instruments and melodies coming from every different direction.  Then I put in Boston and couldn't tell a difference from the cd version I already own.  I think it's one of the best albums, but if you already own it on cd, don't bother upgrading - there's nothing special about the SACD version"

And no, we're not apparently going to have that because Britney's precious time was wasted in incorporating this bore of a song into a single and even attempting a video out of it, like we know ended up in Britney's injury.

2,Don't think Dale can play a song the same way twice. Didn't like the selection of songs nor  the  way they produced. 
1,My 8 year old daughter was very dissappointed after receiving this CD for Christmas.

It's very dissappointing that Disney doesn't tell you this on the CD

2,"Britain, circa 1997.  Tony Blair is elected P.M.  Princess Di perishes.  And the Spice Girls are unleashed to an unsuspecting public.  This effort is an attempt to cash in on the phenomenon before a fickle populace turns their attention to the next best thing.  To be fair, the girls are not to blame for what a tedious flick this is.  Rather, they are appealing and prove to be the film's lone redeeming factor.  The fault lies in the script that tries to do for the Spice Girls what ""A Hard Days' Night"" did for the Beatles.  Whereas the Fab Four's film was full of wit and cogent commentary on Beatlemania this flick is unfunny and basically incoherent about what it's trying to say about the Spice craze.  I was reminded more of the Monkees' ""Head"" than I was of ""A Hard Days' Night"".  Lots of celeb cameos (Roger Moore, Elton John, et al) that amount to naught.  Oh, well.  On to ""From Justin to Kelly"""
1,"Vote this one off the island: 19 overproduced prog-tropical instrumentals consisting entirely of primitive thumping, chanting and grunting - sort of a new age tribal orgy with pygmy porn music composed by Phil Collins. It's all supposed to convey the drama, intrigue and relevance of a TV show (Survivor Yell, Mud Bath, Chase Race, Tally the Vote, I Can See It, Buzzed) with no drama, intrigue and relevance. A desperate last ditch dig for one of the most unimportant moments in television"
1,"This disc is BAD!!! Right at the 2"" mark the sound of the ""rock water"" is join by what sounds like a slow draining bathtub. This sound is more or less present throughout the entire hour. Other discs of this type that I've heard don't do this"
2,NOTHING NEW HERE.  I like reading the ridiculous reviews of these cds where people gush all over the screens over how much they love Patton.  This cd is dull.  Suffering from Patton overexposure.  Maybe he should actually spend some time and make an awesome album (Like Secret Chiefs 3 - Book of Horizons)  rather than dozens of merely adequate ones
2,"When I played the first composition on this CD, I started thinking that  perhaps I had purchased a really stellar CD because the first song was  really jumping. But after that, this CD is disapointing to me. There are  maybe three pretty good compositions with the rest being totally  unmemorable. With the three good cuts from this disc and a few from her  first CD, Joyce Cooling could have made one good CD. But, in my opinion,  there aren't enough good songs here to warrant a release of this CD. Joyce  certainly has potential, but she needs to work on her creativity. She sound  here like an artist still maturing in style"
1,"on the liner notes to one of the two blues albums (i think it is shaker) it is said that the original idea was just to perform some of these songs in a one night concert. that should have been as far as it went.  to foist these songs on an unsuspecting public at 19 bucks a crack is highway robbery.  if these are blues songs, then i am robert johnson's illegitimate son. ""death letter"" is good, maybe even great, but cannot compare to the original or to any of the covers i have previously heard.  the rest is a waste of time.  the cover art is excellent but hardly the reason you would be expected to buy the cd.  these are my first 2 reviews by the way, but all these 5-star reviews for both cd's finally got me motivated.  go buy a muddy waters or lightning hopkins cd and save 10 bucks in the bargain"
2,"There are only a couple of songs I did like on this cd. I did enjoy Ice Cube and Aaliyah, but the rest of the cd left me cold. I do think that if you can just find the two songs and pay to download them, it would have been better! I suggest borrowing first from a friend and seeing if you actually like it first before you buy."
2,"i like a little bit of it, doesent mean its good, i wont throw it away or anything, ill just let it sift...wait...and look at the album cover most of the time. slayer is getting better though"
1,"The worst Christmas album I ever heard.  I just bought it, played it once, and will NEVER play it again"
1,"I can't believe none of the other reviews of the Ultra Lounge series state that these CD's contain almost all instrumental music, with very few songs that feature vocals.  I expect a lounge music CD to have a mix of both vocal and instrumental tracks, and of the four Ultra Lounge CD's I purchased, I count only three songs with vocals on all four of them.  While the instrumental songs do fit the genre of lounge music, they tend to blend into one another and become mundane after hearing several of them.  The titles of the Ultra Lounge CD's (such as Bachelor Pad or Bossanova) mean very little, as each CD fails to distinguish itself from any other because of all of the instrumental tracks.  The best lounge CD I have heard so far is from an unlikely source.  I purchased it at Pottery Barn, and it has a great mix of vocal and instrumental songs.  Keep this in mind when buying lounge music CD's so that you won't be disappointed the way I was with the Ultra Lounge series"
1,Buddy Holly has a number of collections that are superior to the one put out under the 20th Century Masters series.  Every one of the CDs in this series is skimpy in content and superfluous.  This one is no exception.   Look elsewhere
1,"This CD had the makings of a great recording. The problem was telling Popper where they were performing!Butch,please record another one but leave Popper at home.He's full of a lot of things,but TALENT isn't one of them"
1,"I like most of AC/DC's music, but I can't stand their latest album Stiff Upper Lip.  Stiff Upper Lip is the only AC/DC album where you can play it all the way through, and not even hear one good song.  Stiff Upper Lip doesn't even come close to being as good as Back in Black or Highway to Hell.  Every song on it just bugs the heck out of me.  Listening to one song off this album is enough to test my patience; but enduring all 12 of these musical abominations is enough to drive me crazy!  The overall sound is very similar to their earlier albums like Highway to Hell or Back in Black.  BUT...those CDs had variety, they were semi original, and they were actually pretty good.  THIS CD is just completely worthless.  I have heard some cra ppy CDs in my lifetime, but none of them were more pain to listen to than this.  The vocalist sounds about 10 times worse than he did on their earlier albums, the music is chunky, repetitive, dull, and boring, and most of the songs sound the same. Stiff Upper Lip is so bland and dull sounding that it sounds more like the monotonous droning of an electric fan than a rock n roll band.  The music is so repetitive and similar sounding that its more like listening to the same annoying song for 60 minutes than 12 separate tracks.  This CD is just unbelievaby terrible.  It is a disgrace to this band's legacy, and the band members should be embarrased by it.  Oh well, I guess they probably only made this album because they needed to fulfill their record contract, so I guess they don't care about how awful it is anyway.  All I can tell you potential buyers is to stay as far away from this piece of garbage as possible.  It is a TOTAL piece of cr ap and it is not fit to listen to.  Go buy a GOOD AC/DC CD like Let there Be Rock, High Voltage, Powerage, Highway to Hell, or Back in Black.  Stiff Upper Lip suc ks so hard it leaves a big purple bruise.  It's so awful I'd rather listen to the new Nickelback CD than this!"
1,"To those of you interested in this CD in lieu of finding the &quot;songs with lyrics&quot; in the movie ICE AGE, got bad news for you. They are NOT here!  I really do hate it when a soundtrack is put out for a movie and they don't include the best or features songs in the movie.  Anyway, the song that pretty much everyone wants when Manny, Sid, Diego and the baby are together and walking towards Half Peak is called &quot;Send Me On My Way&quot; by Rusted Root. It is on their latest album &quot;When I Woke&quot;. Put Rusted Root in the Amazon search engine and you should find it.  Hope this helps those looking for this song"
2,"Anna Netrebko's I Puritani selections are way below the art and skill of Callas, Sills, Sutherland, Caballe, and Gencer. She has no passion, no trills, no high notes that are deep and rich. Her best is in the Russian repertoire and possibley some undemanding Mozart.   Her broadcast from the Met Live of the I Puritani was alright, but scooping, avoidance of repetitions, running through passages like a locomotive, and an ending that would have brought the wrath of most opera houses in the world..scooping again, and a tight awful sounding high note. The same tentativenes is also here on this CD.She should know this. Her beauty and acting and allure are what interest the masses, not the voice, which is forgiven everything.  Too bad; she could be a lovely Tatyana some day.Also too, the Traviata is not that great; Anna Moffo , Renee Fleming, M. Caballe, and of course Maria Callas..Listen to these and hear the difference"
1,Yo Nu-Mixx sux i hate when people make cd's like this to make some money off of great artist like Pac. This cd is disrespecting Pac and nobody should get this if your a Pac fan. They take great songs and make crappy beats. Get this if you want to support Pac haters or waste your money
1,"I'm going to the trouble of writing this review to warn you: this cd is not like the other Putumayo cds. No, it is not fun, hip, relaxing, good to dance to, or stimulating. It is a selection of hackneyed Sinatra-style slop sung by a variety of leery-sounding men with fake deep voices. I have this rule for music: if it makes me think of animated dogs kissing over pasta, it sucks. Consider yourself warned. If you like good music, try French Cafe instead"
1,"This is humor? When does the humor begin? Is it close to the end cause I reckon that this ain't funny. Maybe the fans of this guy can go home and beat there spouses with banjos and leave the rest of us alone, I reckin"
1,"This Air Supply should've been cut off a very long time ago.  Whenever any of their songs comes on the radio I immediately shut it off.  Bad ear candy is all they ever recorded.  Mindless, sappy garbage.  Even Bread's music  was more interesting than this"
1,"This cd its just horrible, they sold only 10,000 copies enough to pay for their instruments lol ! There are better bands than this an example is bleeding through so i think no one cares about a re release peace out"
2,"At no point in my following review am I by any means intentionally downing Hank Jr. I am just trying to give an honest review of this cd.  At the time this album was realeased, Hank Jr. was riding high, winning big at the CMA's and ACM's.  He was also releasing some of the most critically aclaimed country records of his recording career.  But then for some reason he decided he needed to record some rock and roll.  To me this cd is a studio recorded version of a Hank Williams Jr. live concert.  The only difference is he didn't botch the vocals as he does on his live show.  The music is decidedly 80% not country, it drifts towards eighties rock.    If you trace Hank Jr.'s recording career, you can point at this cd at the one that started the downward spiral that he has only began to pull himself out of.    I must say though, this cd contains one of Hanks last top 10 hits, ""If the South Woulda Won,"" which is an hard to find recording on his compilations.  I'd say this cd is kinda essential collecion wise, just because of that song. "
2,"I wanted to give this CD as a gift to my 7 year old niece who loves the movie.  I listened to it first to make sure the quality was good. I was so surprised when all I heard was music and no words.  Although the music is nice, I know she would not be too impressed. We had seen the movie together and we loved Mr. Ray's song and wanted to know the words.  It's too bad that I'll have to return or sell it"
1,This never should've been pressed.  They should've taken the mix and thrown it out.  DO NOT BUY!!
2,"The singing is terrible on ""Fly Me To The Moon"".  Don't take my word for it.  Listen to the free sample supplied by Amazon.com .  At 16 seconds into it, when she sings ""all I worship and adore"", she goes almost a whole note sharp for several notes!  Even someone with no musical training can hear it.  The rest of the pieces sound fine"
5,"I just want to put it out there...Audra McDonald is an absolute genious. Everything she touches turns to gold, and I just want to smack some of you for saying that she failed in her attempt to make a great record. This may not be the audra that we are used to, but if you listen closely she's near by. So this CD is a little less difficult vocally. So what? My favorite quality of Ms. McDonald's is that she is emotionally connected to whatever she is singing. She could record twinkle twinkle little star and I would want to listen to it over and over again because she tells a story. So if you buy this CD, listen to it more than once. Let it grow on you. Let Audra do her thang children. Let her do her thang."
5,if you do not own this album you must get your hand on a copy. It is the best debut album since definatly mayby. Tracks like &quot;golden touch&quot; &quot;V.I.C.E&quot; well lets just say every song on the album is a bonnifide hit including the banging&quot;stumbble and fall&quot; which will have you tapping your toes from the first 2 seconds. If you like the libretines or the others or are just looking for a solid cd this is a must have
5,"I won't say to everybody this greatest hits is highly recommended. Being that I never heard all of her albums, so a true fan may feel like some songs is missin'. However for me, who is just really startin to seriously get into pop is somewhat satisfied with these and this is a 5 star collection to me. Some of the tracks I love, a couple I don't like at all and the rest I just like. My favorite ones are in order; Erotica Ray of Light Beautiful Stranger The power of goodbye Deeper and Deeper The prodution is excellent and I love the vocals. If your new to Madonna, my opinion would be to start here. But a true fan can give me lessons."
4,"As one of the founding fathers of today's heavy metal rock music, Iron Butterfly has them power, drive, and sound that made them unique in the world of rock music. This live album serves as a testament to that fact. Eventhough the recordings of live concerts from the late 1960's through the mid 1980's was primative at best (by today's standards), this live recording of Iron Butterfly captures most of the groups best music durring their prime as a chart-topping group of that era. This is a ""must-have"" for all Iron Butterfly fans"
5,"I bought this CD before going to see MMW (with John Scofield) for the first time at First Avenue in Minneapolis Dec 7, 2006.  I had never heard of them before and liked the clip on the venue's website.  So I bought a ticket and wanted to get ""Out Louder"", which I knew they were going to play, to familiarize myself, but the store I was at was out of it.  So I bought ""End of the World"" instead.  While some of it was a little too spacey for my liking at first, I still liked the overall funkiness of it all.    THEN....I saw them PLAY.  You MUST see them PLAY!!  I didn't ever want it to end! I immediately wanted to see them again!  It's less than a week later and I have 2 more CD's (""Out Louder"" and Scofield's ""A-Go-Go"" which they ""back"" him on) and 4 more on the way from amazon as I'm writing this.  I'm like an ADDICT now!  I HAVE to have them on in the car and in the house.  I get back in the car after having been in a store or whatever and they're on and all is right with my world again.    I must say I like ""Out Louder"" and even ""A-Go-Go"" better than ""End of the World"", but only slightly.  It IS trippy with the synth and the other guest players, and I do like it better after a few listens.  I just prefer MMW with less guest musicians"
1,"While I have no doubt of Sting's genuine admiration and love for Dowland's music, the performances here simply will not do. He has obviously learned the notes very carefully, and he does make it through each of these challenging songs...but just barely.  Never do any of these performances really take off and soar and become true interpretations.  The entire enterprise remains firmly earthbound and doggedly ""note-for-note"" in its approach.  To be fair, subtlety and nuance never have a chance with the all-too-close ""pop"" miking of Sting's voice, which makes it sound like he and the excellent lutenist Edin Karamazov weren't even in the same room when performing. Moreover, Sting's proclivity for nasal vocal production and oddly colored vowels tend to render the highly poetic texts almost unintelligible.  Add to this Sting's hokey ""Masterpiece Theatre""-style readings from a letter of John Dowland to Sir Robert Cecil, chief adviser to Elizabeth I, and some ill-advised multitracking effects, and the whole experience quickly becomes unlistenable.  In which case, I won't carp about the disc's rather meager running time of 48 minutes, since even at that short measure, it seems much longer.  I'm just glad I didn't shell out for the disc; I borrowed it from my local lending library, and it goes back at the end of the week"
4,"I'm going to avoid focusing on the politics involved here and focus on the music. go to the moveon.org and musicforamerica.com sites and judge for yourself whether they're causes worth giving money to. If so, read on, if not, browse for something else.   Though primarily focused on ""indie"" acts, this album is still pretty diverse, which can be both a good and bad thing (whose idea was it to follow up a typically jazz-pop-rap track by Will.i.am from the Black-eyed Peas with They Might Be Giants' cover of William Henry Harrison's 1840's campaign song?). Highlights include the aforementioned TMBG song, OKGO's surprisingly subtle cover of The Zombies ""This Will Be Our Year"", former Soul Coughing vocalist Mike Doughty's ""Move On"",  Laura Cantrell's haunting rendition of country classic ""Sam Stone"", and the late Elliott Smith's ""A Distorted Reality..."", soon to be available on his posthumous album From The Basement On The Hill. The problem lies in too many live/alternate versions of things; the ""acoustic"" rendition of Fountains Of Wayne's ""Everything's Ruined"" improves on the far too muted original from their debut album, but the Blink 182 remix is barely different from the original (which isn't a good song to begin with), the Bright Eyes live track is gratingly drawn out, and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs live version of ""Date With The Night"" is too murky to really capture their manic live shows. As a compilation, this album has a few flaws, and is a bit overstuffed with alternate versions and live material, but overall it's got enough good material to warrant purchase if you like at least a handful of the bands involved, and again, you believe in the cause."
4,"It's no box set and therefore (inevitably) excludes some tunes I wouldn't have, but this is a good sampler of Tom Scott's 70s &quot;heydays,&quot; including the crank-it-up &quot;Gotcha&quot; (Starsky &amp; Hutch TV theme song) and soulful &quot;Shadows,&quot; among others.  I was disappointed more from &quot;Blow It Out&quot; wasn't included, but overall it's a good (not great) single album's worth of Tom Scott.  If you like 70s fusion (for lack of a better term), you should like this.  Certainly worth $.."
1,"I've been listening to Frank Sinatra for years, and this kind of stuff just leaves me cold - I'd rather here the man himself...  Or, for a completely different take on the material, someone with a completely original approach like Shamus Dark, and his album ""Songs For Suicidal Lovers"", which sounds like nothing I've heard before, whilst staying true to the fantastic songs. As www.evolutionofmedia.com said: ""...aural film noir...delve into the dark side..."
5,"Prince's 1981 album CONTROVERSY is another classic album in his catalog. The title track is the standout immediately. This longer version than the single version features a prayer. The song is funky and effective. ""Sexuality"" is a great disco/funk number. ""Do Me, Baby"" is probably one of the sexiest songs he's ever done. This full length version is the one to hear. ""Private Joy"" is another funky song which is another favorite on the album. ""Ronnie, Talk To Russia"" is a short protest kind of song. Same goes for ""Annie Christian"", which he wrote about the shooting of John Lennon, Ronald Reagan, various Atlanta child murders. Not as effective as ""Ronnie, Talk To Russia"" but a decent track nonetheless. Overall a highlight in Prince's career"
1,"I bought this CD because it got a lot of good reviews, and the description sounded like something I would enjoy. However, it turned out to be an atrocious CD. It is very repetitive and monotonous throughout. The songs pretty much all sound the same. There's little melodic variation, and the vocals have basically no range. The lyrics are extremely uninspired. I'm glad I bought this used at a cheap price. I don't know if I'm going to give it away or just throw it away; it's that bad."
2,"I purchased this cd expecting a solid group of songs from JMM.  However, this album really lacks when it comes to good material. There really isn't one song that stands out, nothing worth playing over and over.  The entire album is pretty much ""blowing flowers out of your [rear end]"" types of songs. The title cut, ""Pictures"" is about a guy that likes to take pictures of his family and looks forward to taking more.  It sounds like something an 8 year old wrote.  Rather than wasting 15 bucks on this cd, get a Pat Green or Brad Paisley cd, they are much more worth your money"
4,"I have been ""making"" my kids listen to the music of TMBG for years, but I no longer have to ""make"" them listen.  My 6 and 7-year-olds actually ""want"" to listen to songs like ""No!,"" ""Clap Your Hands,"" and ""Four of Two.""  Although this is not TMBG's best CD (some say it is ""Flood""), this is my kid's favorite TMBG's CD"
5,"This CD will really grow on you. So listen to it several times before you make your final judgement. It is one of Van Morrison's best.  This CD appears to be almost Autobiographical at times. Especially STRANDED...JUST LIKE GRETA...THEY SOLD ME OUT. His Jazz background, his Irish background, his Blues  background...are all present on this CD."
2,"i usually dont add my two cents to highly reviewed music but in this fickle world you are only as good as your last album,and since we usually have to wait half a decade for you to spit out another this makes it worse. Ive seen Sade often in concerts and she has always had a great sound. this album is more pop. If it ain't broke don't fix it"
1,"Remember the days when we were punks and we'd gather 'round the phonograph and listen to some Puccini on the old Edison cylinders? They held up to 4 minutes of music! Count 'em, 4 minutes! Then that hippie opera singer Enrico Caruso came along and all the young punks would listen to him, including myself. He was quite the singer. When I was a young kid though, the only form of music we had were the concerts. I remember seeing Franz Liszt play the piano in concert, quite an amazing virtuoso, and Johann Strauss Jr. conducting his orchestra, those were the days.   Then they came out with those things called grammophones, which were even more modern, if it was even possible. But it was, because then they came out with a new modified version of the phonograph that all the young punks would listen to, lazy kids. I mean, you didn't even have to crank a handle like you had to with grammophones. And what's this, 1 hour, a full 60 minutes of music, on 1 record? Pshaw! 4 minutes of music was all I needed, and I was still pooped out even after that. In my day, it was bed at 4 p.m., breakfast at 2 a.m., then off to the mines. We didn't have 60 minutes of free time.   I have no idea what form of music they have now. Appearently, they came out with a couple other things after the phonograph. Now all I see these days are kids with their fancy eye-pods (?) and MP3, MP4 players, whatever they're called, listening to that ""hip-hop"" tomfoolery of theirs. You can't even call it music, it's just noise. Well, gotta get ready for bed now, it's almost 3:45"
4,"Tabitha, Athena, and Lavonn, I'll leave all of my women for you three.  Let's talk music, Surrender, I Like, Keep On, Giving You My Love Again, and the songs with Keith Sweat sound great.  These ladies were in the range of groups like SWV and Jade.  That's a good class to be in. "
1,"wow...i look at this track listing and it makes me cringe....i mean i know that warped lost its punk credibility back in 2003, but this is just overkill....relient k, academy is, everytime i die, from first to last, underoath, matchbook romance, saves the day are reasons not to support this tour(for all those people who go just to see NOFX, Casualties, and Time Again)...i REALLY give bad religion and rancid props for not being on here this time around! this is worse than last year's by far....but what could you expect? these tours over the past 3 years have been on a downfall...i mean the bands that are good on this aren't really worth the agony and disgust to want to purchase this and/or purchase a 40$ ticket to one of the shows. to me, that is a scam...im so glad that people stopped referring to warped tour as a ""punk"" tour...i mean maybe if NOFX gets a hefty amount of boos from those trendy scenester hot topic kids, then maybe even those guys can see what hell this ""nu-emo"" trend is.  now, i am not going to go off on some explosion about what real punk is, but i will say this....fans of warped 2003 and back...steer clear..this is merely a compilation of green day-esque bands(minus Time Again and Casualties..and maybe 3-5 other decnet bands)....some are turned up a few thousand jolts and some are slowed down a little bit, but i bet any of them will admit that bille joe(brainless) armstrong is a deep inspiring figure.  all we are really missing here to make this the ultimae pile of crap is fallout boy, simple plan, yellowcard, blink 182, good charlotte and new-school afi.  bottom line...avoid like the plague and maybe it will change next year for the better!......most likely it'll be worse, but hey, stranger things have happened"
2,"i gotta say I used to love this album back in the late 70's . just purchased again thru amazon here and it really isn't as good as I remembered . . .they are quite loose, the songs don't stand the test of time, the playing not nearly as great as I remember it to be. . . surprisingly rough on groove. . . . not a true classic - i thought it wa"
1,"""With 22 tracks sprawling over 74 arse-numbing minutes, Cripple Crow is hopelessly self-indulgent. It's a pity, because on the few occasions when Banhart applies the quality control - as on the short but pretty 'Dragonflies' - he shows flashes of McCartney-esque melodic craft. Generally, though, Banhart is happiest when he's wasting an hour and a quarter of your valuable time with his witless meandering and irritating stoner-drawl. ""  ""Already this year we have heard the awesome Amadou & Mariam record on which producer Manu Chao brilliantly fuses western pop sensibilities with ethnic sounds to create fresh and invigorating music. In comparison, Banhart's feeble grasp of world/folk music comes across as a shoddy, flashy sweatshop counterfeit.""  It's probably this month's top-seller in Tower Records of Goa, however"
5,"I dont know what the fuss is wether the fans will be accepting to The Killers new sound and look, I for one love it! By the 3rd time i heard the album, i knew there was no way i'd be able to stop listening to it for a very long time, just like Hot Fuss. The songs are great, the hooks are awesome and its so polished to perfection."
1,"I purchased this CD and I was ripped off. The sounds on the CD are pathetic. They are of poor quality, with one person standing in a sound booth. I could have made a better recording with my tape recorder and mic myself. I was looking for a CD to compile a string of sounds for my Haunted house. Now I have to find another means of getting these sounds. DON'T BUY THIS CD. You will not get your moneys worth"
1,"Well what the hell to expect from a big cynical misanthrope such as myself?  Flowery bubbly warm rays of sunshine?  HELL NO!  You see folks it's people like Lil Jon that make me think in such a morbid manner.  When I see Special Ed. failures who look and act like mental house rejects make lots of money I tend to get a little pessimistic.  BUT CAN YOU BLAME ME?  Seriously, let's screw our heads on tightly and think about this for a second, why would a sane person actually listen to let alone actually purchase this cd?  This is a complete joke.  I'm simply calling it like I see it.  Lil Jon deserves no respect from any human being, not even his crack head of a mother.    Actually you might as well compare Lil Jon to Elmo, Elmo being a puppet has a MILLION times more skill at what he does.  At least Elmo is a good and wholesome children's icon that kids can have fun with.  If I ever have a kid someday Elmo will still be a hit with the kids but Lil Jon will still be laughed at once all his ""fans"" grow up and realize how stupid they were to actually buy into his garbage he pans off as ""music"".  Meh, well who I am kidding this review (like my last 6) probably won't even get posted anyway. "
1,My alarm clock is set at 3:40. Superhero underwear is cool. CD Drives blink. I got a concussion from the fire alarm. Puppies will conquer the world. Wonder Woman Would beat up Superman. U r the coolest person in the world. Thank you for looking at this useless revie
4,"OK I can't myself here, but this guy really listened to a lot Supertramp growing up or something.  I liked to album, but I can hear hints of Supertramp's style in about half the songs here in different degrees.  ""Bad Day"" probably the most notable of the bunch really sounds like something that came of the ""Breakfast in America"" album to me.  Still the album is enjoyable though, especially if you did like Supertramp.  I get the Leo Sayer hook, but I think it's off a bit.  Leo never used that many keyboards"
1,i would review it if i got it. come on guys. i placed the order on 1/6/06.
1,The songs just did not get me dancing.  I have to say I was disappointed.  But I love Kids Favorite Songs VOl 2 but was never able to buy it as it was not availabl
1,I was listening to water boil this morning. I preferred it to this album
1,"Is it true that the lead singer for Hinder only records while he is on the toilet constipated? His voice sounds so. The way he sings ""Lips of an Angel"" makes me want to punch him in the face! I'd rather pick dried semen out of my pubic hair over listening to this group. I seriously almost tripped and fell at work trying to get to the radio and change the station before I heard the chorus! "
5,"This music so so wonderful.  It is very high energy and fun.  The kids don't really care that this a ""jazz"" album- what they do know is that they love the music and it makes them feel happy.  Don't waste your money and insult your kids intelligence and your ears with the what sells as ""kids"" music, get them something you can both enjoy.  Our favorites are the ""Doodle"" song and ""Potato Chips.""  Worth every penny and then some"
5,This is one of the best kid CDs I've heard.  The songs are all catchy and fun to listen to.  It's a great intro to jazz
5,"This was They Might Be Giants first major label album.  It continued, and expanded upon, the sound they had established on their independant label albums.  It's probably TMBG's most popular album.  It features many classic TMBG songs, like ""Birdhouse in Your Soul"", ""Istanbul"" and ""Particle Man"".  It's chock full of the catchy melodies and silly lyrics that we have come to expect from the Johns.  A must have for all They Might Be Giants fans"
5,Our 22 mo. old loves this music much more than the kiddy tunes that mom and dad can hardly bear to listen to.
5,"Hot Hot Heat's Make up the Breakdown is a follow-up of Knock Knock Knock. Personally, if you're a big Hot Hot Heat fan, this will be one of your most favorite albums. Each and every song is unique and has catchy beats that will make you want to dance. The first song Naked in the City Again is great.  The second song, No, Not Now, is a popular tune that you can't help but start movin'. Get in or Get out has some of the most rad keyboarding parts. Bandages, one of the biggest hits on the album is sort of what boosted Hot Hot Heat's career and just this one song will make the album worth purchasing. Oh Goddamnit is such an amazing song, with very fun lyrics so you're bound to sing along. The next song Aveda keeps many of us wondering: Ex-Girlfriend or Hair Product? Either way you'll like you'll still enjoy this song. This Town, many believe was written about some crazy fans, you listen and decide for yourself. Talk to Me, Dance with Me was also a very big hit that got fans into Hot Hot Heat. This song makes me dance, sing, and every other thing you can do to your favorite song. On Save us S.O.S. you will love how deep the lead singer, Steve Bays' voice sounds, your heart will melt. Although very different from Hot Hot Heat's normal songs, In Cairo, is also a great song and adds a fabulous ending to Make up the Breakdown. This cd will be in your stereo for hours on end. The songs are addicting so this album is definately worth it's money. "
5,"Wonderful harmony, great voices, beautiful music.  This group deserves to be better known and to be hugely successful"
1,"The first time I heard about Antony and the Johnsons was from a friend of mine that told me about Rufus Wainwright and was listening to a new artist that was quite incredible.  I decided to do some investigating about this Antony at a local Barnes & Noble and what I discovered was very, very dissapointing.  I find the music to be well written instrumentally and layered quite well, but Antony's voice is very over the top and fake.  By fake, I mean his use of vibrato, which is very rapid and used in a way that comes out as forced and sheeplike (not natural).  Professional voice instructors teach that the correct way to use vibrato is at the right speed: five to six vibrations per second.  It is evident that Antony's ""trained"" sounding voice is not trained at all in this realm.  Another thing about this band and record that I find very horrible is the lyrics to the songs.  The artist seems confused or regretful of his own gender using a sorrowful and painful delivery of these wailings.  The lyrics hold no attraction or relation to the listening, which lends the listener to a pitiful and almost annoying view of the music itself because of this.  My conclusion is that this is a terrible record and the singer needs to pursue professional voice lessons... and help"
5,"St. Elsewhere combines the energy of club beats with the soulful [and at times wistful] voice of Cee-Low and thought-provoking lyrics. I enjoy the variety of styles [from the frentic ""Go-Go Gospel"" to the introspective ""Just a Thought""]. A must-have purchase"
2,"the music can be explained and defined pretty much as the title itself just think of ""classic"". I assumed the music was going to be very club material that has a history of songs being played after the years by clubs.. a large portion of the cd i cannot see it as a gothic ""club"" material esspecially throwing in some type-o.. i been through alot of clubs and i cannot find a way to hit that song in the dance floor.. if not i guess i have been in the wrong places.. it looks to me they ran out of ideas and threw in some mainstream that everyone listens to so they would  i was very dissapointed in the whole cd. listened to a few songs here and there, if you are into the old stuff then this is the stuff for you.. i really dont recomend this cd to any collection besides you want to be blasted in the past."
4,"Having left my Gothic Club mix CD at home, I decided to buy this one. What hooked me first was the live recording of ""Bela Lugosi's Dead"" by Bauhaus, which is classic Goth music. Some of the bands I liked, some I didn't, but all in all this is a great CD. My favorite is ""Sheryl"" on the second CD. This is a great CD for chilling, dancing, or showing the uneducated masses what Goth music really is"
2,"Tony Yayo's ""Thoughts of a Predicate Felon"" suffers from the fact that Tony Yayo simply doesn't know who he is (or who he is supposed to be) on this album. Before I listened to this album, I expected to hear gritty, descriptive rhymes about Yayo's criminal life. Unfortunately however, I, like many of you, tuned into tracks such as ""Tattle Teller,"" ""Curious,"" and ""Project Princess."" For an ex-convict, that is not the type of message you want to project to an audience that is expecting something more... hardcore; something better. On tracks such as ""Live By The Gun"" and ""Homicide,"" Yayo delivers my aforementioned desire for ""harder"" lyrics, but tracks such as these are few and far between. Hopefully Tony Yayo can focus on doing this for his next album but for now, this debut album is simply a dissapointment"
1,"I think this album is boring. I think it doesnt do its job. I think Lil Jon is a wannabe. I think they needs to get a real job. I think this broke very soon after i got it. I think this won't play in most cd players. i think the cover looks stupid. i think it gave me the idea to scream YEAH! and WHAT! at my brothers wake. i think art is stupid. I think i don't recommend this. I think ive said enough. I think im going to hell now. I think i was anyway, cause i think i sold my soul"
4,"This album is a masterpiece by a legend who, at 65 years old, topped the charts. Dylan is an extroadinary talent and seems to get even better with age. Every song is exceptional and showcases his great talent and songwriting ability"
5,"I first heard this song last summer while I was painting our house. Out in the fresh air and the sun (and recently wed), this song immediately caught my attention and only seemed to get more irrestible with every listen. While it's what I guess I would call somewhat of a ""rock"" song (during the chorus),  it's Alex Band's vocals that conveys the longing, passionate love element of the song. He manages to keep it romantic and unique instead of just making it a another decent rock song. I've also heard Chad's version from the album; while Chad's vocals are actually not *that* much different from Alex's (both manage to be very masculine and strong), I feel that the version with Chad is a ""good"" song while Alex's delivery makes it a ""great"" song. While Chad's voice is great for other songs, for this type of song it is overly domineering and angry-sounding. From a woman's perspective, Alex's way would manage to convince me to ""get together"" while Chad's would scare me off! Sometimes, one vocalist is just ""meant"" to sing a song and either make it or break it. Think of ""Smooth"" from 1999. Rob Thomas' delivery helped to make that song the hit it was. In this case, Alex is the perfect man for the job."
5,"An outstanding set of kid's music with folk scene stalwarts such as Arlo Guthrie, Taj Mahal and Tim O'Brien joined by bluegrassers Tim O'Brien and Rhonda Vincent and blues pickers Keb Mo, Guy Davis and Eric Bibb, as well as Americana-country types such as Rosie Flores... An impressive lineup, sure, but better still is the calibre of songwriting, and the actual kid friendliness of it all.  This is a really fun album!  Fun, as in, little kids might actually like it, and might even sing along if you played it for them.  Plenty of silly songs like ""Bling-Blang,"" ""Bananaphone"" and ""Bellybutton Song.""  Some songs are perky, like ""Red, Red Robin""; others are instructive, like ""Man Named All The Animals,"" and others still model assertiveness and communication skills, like Taj Mahal's excellent ""Don't You Push Me Down,"" in which various kids stick up for themselves in unpleasant situations.  I like this album a lot, and plan to play it for my kid for years to come"
5,"You are great on this one Danielle, I love and miss you so much. I wish it was 1982 and you were still on Archie Bunkers Place. You poor thing, I'll be your main reviewer from now on. Why are you hiding that great voice and acting talent in New York. I would love to put you to work for Mirror Vision Inc. Records in Morro Bay CA. I plan to see you in concert soon and hope you are having a good fall. I think of you often and always mention your bright star to other people, I wish I could think of you more, you have never met me, and I know we have become distant, but you are still the mystery of my life, say hello to your dad and mom for me, and I miss you from Morro Bay CAlifornia,(i love you babe) love garr"
5,"In 1975, Joe Jackson was tired of Motown Records controlling his childrens' careers. So he moved them over to Epic Records. The newly Christened ""Jacksons"" had to prove themselves to not only CBS Records, but to the world that they could produce, write, and perform their own records with plausible credibility.So instead of being controlled by Henry Cosby, Hal Davis, and to a lesser extent, Berry Gordy at Motown, their direction was handed over by Epic to Philidelphia Phunk-Meisters Kenneth Gamble, and Leon Huff. They had a tremendous string of success, with Teddy Pendergrass, MFSB, Harold Melvin, and The Blue Notes, and McFadden and Whitehead to name just a few.  They took the Jacksons' original songs, brought them into the studio, worked their Philly majik, and out came one of the greatest Soul records ever cut on wax. From Start to finish, ""The Jacksons"" takes you from one Phunkified Phunk Phest top the next, starting with ""Enjoy Yourself"" and Culminating in the Phunkadelic ""Style Of Life"". When I was a child I heard this record, and originally thought that ""Good Times"" was the Jackson's remake of the theme from that TV show. But it was pure slow Phunk. Phunk-da-fied-, Phunkalicious, or just just plain Phantastic, The Jackson's Epic Debut is Phat"
5,"I am 68 and a long time Stewart fan, this is one of his best.  Don't know what the problem is with the other reviewers"
5,"What would have happened if Ian Curtis had not pulled the plug on his own life?  It is a hard question to ask since I am a very devoted Joy Division Fan but I also am a good fan of New Order.  I have to say that I imagine Joy Division might have recorded one ore two more albums  and broken up: New Order may have never been.  So while it is tragic that Curtis committed suicide it gave the way for the rest of Joy Division the license to effectively reinvent themselves as New Order.  The band is very Different from JD but in ""Power, Corruption Lies"" , New Order's first, we hear a hint of JD with a burst of new creativity that must have been the results of a painful and cathartic period.    The music on this album is more heavily Synth and Drum based than any of the JD material though maybe not as much as later New Order work.  By 1983 synths and drum machines were just coming into their own and this year saw the invention of the MIDI interface for synths etc. It was also a time when the new wave movement was finally getting solidified.  All history aside, the album is great: it is upbeat, full of poppy dance tracks and a real new wave classic.  If you are buying the album just for ""Blue Monday"" (a track so good even a horrible band like Orgy could make a hit out of it) you are in for a real surprise. You will find many of the other tracks to be great as well.  ""Age of Consent"" is among my other favorites.  This is another great track for dancing.  Also ""the Village""  is a great track as well.  If you are going to buy two New Order albums get this one and Substance.  Although they share a few tracks they are both great.  I find that this album get far more play though.  This is a must have for the New Order fan of course.  But also fans of new wave/'80's music and Joy Division fans alike should also buy this one.  This album has received so much acclaim and has been so influential in its 20-year life span that it should be a must have for any modern music fan.  I highly recommend it!  -- Ted Murena   "
5,This CD is great for the entire family. The songs are catchy and it's not a big deal if you're caught singing them around strangers!
2,"I really couldn't wait to get this CD.  I wanted so badly to like it.  But - it is just too bluegrassy for me.  Every single song.  It would be great one or two songs, but every song gets old.  Plus, the recording quality doesn't seem that great.  You can barely hear the words, and most kids want to sing along.  Jenny Jenkins is a fun song, and Shenendoah is hauntingly beautiful, but For the Kids and NO! are way better CD's"
5,"I enjoy the album still to this day. All the songs are good, but I listen a couple of songs more than others such as Hold On, You don't have to worry, Don't Go.  This is a great album, which I don't planning on selling or trading anytime soon. "
5,The Crusaders Sound Great on this Disc.The Music&amp;Arrangements work very well all the way thru.The Grooves&amp;Smoothness make this Recording very Complete.this Group has been Bad for so long
5,"If it has the name Edwin McCain on it, trust me its a great product to buy. The songs he writes are heart felt and true to every drop of ink used to write them with.."
1,"Following on from the fantastic 'The Duel' Allison Moorer's latest release 'Getting Somewhere' is a massive, massive  disappointment. Quite simply the material on 'Getting Somewhere' is weak and gutless.  On the rare occasions Moorer tries to emulate the beauty and feel of 'The Duel' - such as on Hallelujah & New Years Day - Earle rips the heart out of the material with such an amateurish, pedestrian and thin production that you feel cheated ! Business and pleasure rarely mix and Moorer should take a long, hard look at this release and give serious consideration to re-installing RS Field next time around.  If Moorer wants a guitar groove that burns , drums that drive and vocals that mesmerise then Earle is simply not the man for the job.  Moorer is a fantastic talent who has one of the finest female voices of any genre (she can write a mean song too ! ) . This CD showcases none of her abilities and should be consigned to the bargain bins immediately"
1,"I get the feeling that most of the reviews on here for this album are written by folks who feel special because they think they discovered some new amazing genre and sound that no one else knows about.  Hate to break it to you kids, but this sounds has been around since the mid 90s.  It was called Neutral Milk Hotel and it was vastly superior to these con-artists called the Decemberists.  Before you disagree with me, go pick up Neutral Milk hotel's In the Aeroplane over the Sea (1997), and then try to disagree"
5,"Carbon Leaf's sound continues to evolve, and the results are outstanding. The band says it has given up trying to ""define"" its style of music, since it's a shifting blend of so many influences and original ideas. In the past, Carbon Leaf has played variations of rootsy folk-rock with Celtic, bluegrass, and alt-pop flourishes. This new album is focused more on a clean but no less impressive, straightforward pop-rock sound that's catchy without being cloying, radio-friendly without being superficial. Even with this focus, there's excellent variety: ""Block of Wood"" has a gorgeous country-rock lilt, for example, while ""International Airport"" flirts with jazz. All in all, this is a polished gem that deserves to be the band's breakout album.  The songs range from engaging (""Bright Lights,"" ""Love Loss Hope Repeat"") to anthemic (""Learn to Fly,"" ""Comfort"") to heartbreaking (""Block of Wood"") to humorous (""A Girl and Her Horse"") to profound (""The War Was in Color""). If you enjoy infectious melodies, stunning harmonies, thought-provoking and often bittersweet lyrics, beautiful instrumentation, and pristine, finely crafted production, you will love this album.   There are acoustic rhythm guitars aplenty, neatly embellished with subtle electric guitar riffs and fills (Terry Clark and Carter Gravatt), anchored by a killer rhythm section (Jordan Medas on bass and Scott Milstead on drums) and some touches of mandolin (Gravatt again). This album also has a bit more keyboard work than some of Carbon Leaf's earlier releases, courtesy of guest musician Tim Lauer. Soaring above it all is the clear, resonant and at times hypnotic voice of lead singer Barry Privett, who also writes all of the band's lyrics.  This is my favorite release of 2006 so far, along with ""Ganging Up on the Sun"" by Guster. Both new and longtime fans of Carbon Leaf have much to celebrate with ""Love, Loss, Hope, Repeat."
4,One thing I love about greatest hits packages from groups with only one legitimate hit is that you never grow tired of them. Timbuk 3's greatest hits package is a good place to start enjoying their music and you will not  get tired of hearing songs you've heard a million times on the radio. If  you want more info on the band seach the web because there is a least one  great web site. After buying this CD and the live one you will have to  seach the used bins and I highly recommend the album Eden Alley
5,"This soundtrack is excellent. There is not a single song that I skip when listening to the cd.  The mix of recent and older songs sung by familiar and unfamiliar artists is great.  Anita Nalick, Breathe (2a.m.) is worth the price of the album."
5,"I haven't bought an album for such a long time because who needs to spend the extra cash when there's online piracy? But I have to own this.  Feinstein's voice is so pure and versatile; he is funny at a moment and the next, he can be so heartbreakingly bittersweet. His performance is first class, and one has to consider that he can sing so well at a live concert.  "
4,"I have maybe a hundred Christmas CDs (it's a hobby) but I think this is the only one with the ""Explicit Lyrics"" warning!  This is fore just for one song ""Here Comes Fatty Claus"" which featured a fairly prominent use of the ""sh*t"" word.  I have a fairly young child and burnt a copy of the CD without that song. She loves it!  As for the CD... it's pretty good. Waters has managed to collect the best of campy Christmas songs, something unique as far as I'm aware.    But it's not just a novelty CD... the songs are good. This isn't intentional camp... it is sincere stuff with MAYBE the exception of the Tiny Time song. (One of my daughter's favorite, because it's well done."
1,"As if Fiddy Cent wasn't enough to make me break some bones, this horrible trend of Kayne West comes in. What is there to be said that hasn't been said? Nothing, really; my work has been done by all the one-star reviewers. All I have to say is that I hope this rapper fades away from the universe sooner or later.  Want good rap? Go for Tupac (R.I.P.) or Public Enemy"
1,"Most people considered this the Cheap Trick &quot;comeback&quot; album.  Sixteen years after the fact I'm forced to admit that it ranks as more of a &quot;go-back&quot; album instead.  While Cheap Trick didn't set the music world on fire with most of their 80's releases, it wasn't until the rot set in on the unbelievably sub-par release &quot;The Doctor&quot; that I actively had to search for something good to say about one of their albums.  On &quot;The Doctor&quot; I searched but came up empty.  &quot;Lap Of Luxury&quot; isn't quite that bad, but it set a bad tone for the releases to follow.  I've made dozens of Cheap Trick compilations over the years and &quot;Let Go&quot; was the only song that I included off of LOL.  The thing that consistently irritated me with each subsequent release in the 80's and early 90's was the press release that was issued saying how this was the album that took the Trick back to their rockin' roots.  Well let me tell ya, this is far from it.  I know.  I remember"
5,"Dan Zanes is great! My husband and I both enjoy listening to this as well as our 20 month old. Most of the other music CD's that we have for our son I find a little irritating after a bit of listening. Rocket Ship Beach is fun, family music! I highly recommend this to all ages"
1,"Wow!!! This is a horrible album. I really enjoyed Comin' From Where I'm From, so I expected good things from this one right here. Wrong. On the title track Anthony Hamilton comes with some potentially positive socially-conscience lyrics, then he starts talking about praying. Of course mythological-minded cult people aren't worried, they think mythical magical people will come out of the sky and fix everything if they just stay on their knees. The four subsequent songs are full on Jesus songs. People want warning labels for albums they deem to be offensive for whatever reason, but they need some kind of cult warning. I would not have purchased this CD had I known it was on some cult mess. In ""Preacher's Daughter"" he even says ""A preacher's daugher so she had common sense."" I'm not sure if that's supposed to be a joke, but common sense should tell one magic people don't live in the clouds. Then ""Pass Me Over"" reminds me of the that two-part skit on Ice Cube's Lethal Injection where the cat is just sitting there waiting for Jesus and gives Ice Cube all his stuff, 'cause he thinks Jesus will give him new stuff. But Anthony Hamilton tries to make it sound like a positive thing to just sit there and wait for mythology to become reality. If people think this type of behavior is a real solution to one's personal problems or the worlds problems then I, for one, am very worried about our future, or probable complete lack there of. That's a very dangerous mind state. ""Sista Big Bones"" is a good song, but it's not worth purchasing this"
4,"Bubble from Ab Fab sounds exactly like Marilyn Monroe, Billie Holiday, Judy Garland and others.  What a talent.  She needs her own Las Vegas Show.  She would be beyond great!  "
5,"Lots and lots of positive and negative reviews about this record in a comparison sense to their previous work it seems. Honestly, I didn't know of any personnel changes to and/or from the band prior to listening to it three times through. Evanescence is the real deal. Enjoy! Five Stars."
5,"I'm one of those people who didn't really *know* anything about Beck.  Oh sure I knew his hits - ""Loser"", ""Where It's At"", ""The New Pollution"" et al.  Just never really thought much about the guy.  Until...about three months ago when I downloaded a couple tracks from this album from Napster2Go...""E Pro"" and ""Girl"".  After giving them a few listens I downloaded the entire Guero album not long thereafter.  I don't know what to say that hasn't already been said by a lot of others here- it's been voted one of the Best of 2005 for a REASON.  This is an AWESOME album.  During a looong road trip I played some of the tracks for my Better Half and he gradually got addicted...starting with ""Earthquake Weather"".  Now it's not only this album but pretty much the entire Beck catalog for the two of us :) Even the songs I started out being ""meh"" about grew on me (and hubby) BIG TIME.  Just a great album...musicianship is spot on, and Beck definitely has a strong sense of humor mixed with a healthy dose of irony!  The tracks which are STANDOUTS (at least in our opinion) are E-Pro (great kick start to the album); Que Onda' Guero (LOVE the lowrider horns throughout, along with the ""Hey! Guero!"" random shouts); Girl (catchy...this should have been a HUGE hit...); Earthquake Weather (haunting melody, great riff!), Hell Yes (hai!); and I really love Rental Car...just a cute little song - way too short...also catchy riff and verses!  DO check this album out.  Absolutely a gem"
5,"""Alt-country"" would indeed be a limiting description,none-the-less an accurate point of reference,as this artist is obviously drawing from past Country musicians.But make no mistake,this is not a tired retread thru the same-old same-old but rather an exceptional modern piece of music.I'm usually more inclined towards the Heavy than the twangy,but this is just so well written and catchy with a distinct melancholic cloud hanging over the proceedings,and this woman can SING.One of the few recent musicians that deserve that designation"
5,"After the profound impact of the David Rawlings produced ""O.C.M.S.,"" to my music collection, my pre-order of ""Big Iron World"" came with pretty high expectations. I've listened to it three times since receiving it in the mail last night and though it doesn't sport tracks with the immediate staying power of ""Wagon Wheel,"" ""Big Iron World"" does pull some wonderfully surprising punches. Though he doesn't capture OCMS's live act at it's fullest (and who really could), Rawlings' production once again manages to maintain OCMS's authenticity and pushes their ""old-time"" music into the modern area, without a hint of the tacky, over-produced, artificial, gimmicks, heard on other neo-bluegrass records.   ""Big Iron World"" is not an album stuck in history, or looking to bite of the accomplishments of the past. With ""Big Iron World,"" OCMS once again displays its own sound, pushing the limits of bluegrass/county/rock/punk/folk forward, while paying its respect and harkening back to the fables of Woody Guthrie, the picking of Muleskinner and the late 60's albums of Dylan. Moreover, the songs of ""Big Iron World"" comprise a complete body of work. The pro-union, ""Union Maid"" and folksy ""James River Blues"" are the standout tracks on an album that works as a whole, with each song complementing the next. As with all of OCMS's albums, ""Big Iron World"" is a breath of fresh air in comparison to most other albums put out by artists of a similar age.  They have put together a great collection of songs to be enjoyed by fans of numerous genres."
5,"by far, Picture This, is my favorite cd from the JB collection...have three copies...one for the home, one for the car, and another he personally signed for me at one of his concerts! Been a fan of his since he appeared on tv talk show back in late 1997...despite our daily hectic schedules, his music always brings us back to a place that is calm, relaxing & peaceful...now that we have small children, they are even accustomed to listening his music, which makes bedtime even sweeter! :)"
1,"You got to be kidding me right? People actually giving this album 5 stars. Wow people are so blind it isn't even funny. This is all commercialized garbage. E-40 is all on this ""hyphy"" tip now, lmao how wack is that. Hyphy is straight wack, the lyrics have no concept what so ever. All pointless.  Production, well yea all these commercialized albums got production, like this album. But then again where are the lyrics?   This is one of those albums where you sit there and like it ONLY because of the beat/hook lol. People that listen to this type of music dont like real Hip-Hop, as I said theyre blind. People that arent big Hip-Hop fans, I dont criticize you for listening, but all you people that claim to be Hip-Hop fans, f*** outta here, you aint.   This album is for commercial rap listeners only, if you like underground STAY away from this at all costs. Pick up some real HipHop instead.  Peace. "
2,"When I first bought this cd I really liked it, but unlike most other cd's it sounded worse with time. After 2-3 months it was just sitting in my drawer and I found myself skipping stations on the radio when they played the Killers. After seeing them live at the Virgin Festival this weekend I know they are totally phony, not only is their cd bland but they are the worst live band ever. Do yourself a favor save your money on this one"
5,"When I make a long night drive home after a loud concert,      I like to listen to something quiet and soothing.  THE PIZZA TAPES is one of my favorite quiet and soothing picks, it's a sweet masterpiece of acoustic jamming and inspired playing.  During two days in February of 1993 Garcia, Grisman and Rice got together to fiddle around with some tunes and see how they came out on tape.  As we all know, the recordings were stolen by the infamous ""Pizza boy"" and soon they became property of the formidable Grateful Dead tape and CD trading community.  Several years later Grisman remastered the recordings and put out the best takes on this album.  This isn't an album of electric jams, it's rather impromptu, quiet and easygoing.  Some people might dismiss it as ""background music.""  However if you take a closer listen, the trio handles the traditional tunes and Bob Dylan tunes and the Gershwin (!) tunes with such skill, there's hardly an uninspired or false note anywhere to be found.  Garcia screws up here and there but even those mistakes are a pleasure to listen to.  Definitely a classic album and something I received with anticipation.  I still enjoy putting this on and it gets better with successive listenings.  By the way, I love the cover art... the CD case is made to resemble a pizza box.  Open it up and the disc is a pizza pie with all the toppings.  On the back is a menu of all the treats including some spicy items (choice words from Garcia!)  I actually get the craving for pizza when I'm listening to the album.  The PIZZA TAPES sure is one tasty album. Great music and great pizza, what a winning combination!"
2,"Pls. Rick Nielsen, ""Tell Me Everything""! Why did  you guys get a sorry Producer like Ted Templeman  to Produce what could have been a great comeback  LP? If you Trick fans wanna be in 'My Gang' then  you gotta spread the news to pray for better ef- forts than this in the future if the Tricksters  are gonna stay employed!  'You're All I Wanna Do' and the title track, with it's ""Mommy and Daddy"" chorus, is kinda  cool and retro for 'Surrender' - now the mar- riage is on the rocks! Like Cheap Trick's ca- reer after this disgrace! It's enough to make  you 'Cry Baby'...Pls. bring back Brant!"
1,"I bought this disk on the strength of the reviews here at Amazon.  What a major disappointment this disk is.  Embarrasingly amateur, with keyboard loop drums and keyboard basses, it is difficult to believe that these are well-known professional reggae singers as well.  Another case of &quot;dumbing-down&quot; music for children, something definitely not required to fully engage kids with music (the outstanding Putamayo series for example is presented no frills, no dumbing-down).  Good &quot;children's music&quot; inspires both parents and kids, and kids react positively to that in their parents. A shame to pay $... for this disk"
5,"I MUST SAY THAT WHEN I FIRST HEARD ""KICK PUSH"" I THOUGHT TO MYSELF THAT THIS GUY REALLY HAD SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE HE IS SUCH A METAPHORIC RHYMER AND HIS DELIVERY IS VERY STRONG SO I KNOW I HAD TO BUY LUPE FIASCO'S DEBUT ALBUM ""FOOD AND LIQUOR"". AFTER LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM FROM BEGINNING TO END I WAS NOT AT ALL DISAPPOINTED BUT INDEED THIS ALBUM REALLY LET ME KNOW THAT THERE ARE STILL A FEW RAPPERS OUT THERE THAT ARE STILL KICKING RHYMES ABOUT ISSUES THAT WE DEAL WITH IN EVERYDAY LIFE INSTEAD OF HEARING THESE OTHER MC'S THAT DONT RAP ABOUT ANYTHING EXCEPT CARS, CLOTHES, JEWELRY, AND WOMEN. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO ANYONE THAT IS A FAN OF REAL RAP BECAUSE THIS ALBUM WILL OPEN YOUR EYES TO ALOT OF THINGS IN LIFE.  MY 5 FAVORITE TRACKS ARE: 1.""THE COOL""- THIS SONG IS BASICALLY ABOUT A YOUNG MAN WHO HAD DIED(NOT LITERALLY) BUT HE WAS ABLE TO COME BACK TO LIFE AND TRY TO MAKE A CHANGE FOR THE BETTER BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE CHOSE TO LIVE HIS LIFE THE SAME WAY HE HAD LIVED IT ONCE BEFORE. SONG IS VERY METAPHOR AND DEEP. 2.""HE SAY SHE SAY""- THIS SONG IS ABOUT A LITTLE BOY WHO DOESNT HAVE A VISIBLE FATHER AND IT IS AFFECTING HIM DEEPLY. 3.""HURT ME SOUL""- THIS SONG TALKS JUST ABOUT ANY ISSUE YOU CAN THINK OF FROM WOMEN BEING DEGRADED IN RAP MUSIC, DRUG DEALING, CROOKED COPS, GOVERNMENT NOT OFFERING BLACK PEOPLE WELFARE AND OVERCHARGING HEALTHCARE, JOHNS AND PROSTITUTES. SONG ALSO HAS A VERY NICE HOOK. 4.""SUNSHINE""- THIS SONG IS ABOUT THIS GIRL THAT HE FALLS IN LOVE WITH IN A CLUB EVENTHOUGH HE'S NOT LOOKING FOR LOVE HE CANNOT RESIST IT WITH THIS GIRL. 5.""PRESSURE"" FEATURING JAY-Z- VERY NICE CONCEPT TO IT FROM LUPE'S STANDPOINT AND EVENTHOUGH IM NOT A BIG JAY-Z FAN HE STILL PUT DOWN A NICE VERSE.  OTHER SONGS I LIKE ARE ""JUST MIGHT BE OK"", ""DAYDREAMININ"", ""KICK PUSH"", ""I GOTCHA"",""INSTRUMENTAL"", AND ""AMERICAN TERRORISTS"".  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO ANYONE WHO IS A TRUE FAN OF REAL RAP BECAUSE IT WILL NOT DISAPPOINT YOU AT ALL!!!!"
5,"I can't rate this one highly enough. It's certainly in a vein with his last couple, but, as has been oft noted, it's more political and full of social commentary. Some people will like it a little less than the two preceding ones, as a result. I expected to have that reaction, but I found the socially conscious elements surprisingly compelling after all, and Rodney melds them well with his more personal insights, which ultimately predominate in the end. Also, focusing on the social commentary can obscure the fact that a good number of these songs are just a lot of fun, like a slightly angrier and more introspective version of the wonderful stuff he did with the Notorious Cherry Bombs.  By the way, if you like this album, you may want to pick up the book ""Rednecks & Bluenecks: The Politics of Country Music."" It's not just about the country you hear on the radio but also alternative country and Americana. And Rodney shows up prominently throughout the book; there's a whole section just about this album"
1,"I was looking at the Billboard Hot 100 last year like I do every week, and at one point I noticed a song that was making moves was ""Grind With Me"" by Pretty Ricky. I had never heard of the song, and after I listened to it, I wished I still hadn't heard of the song. I don't know what possessed me to listen to the full-length album, Bluestars, but I did and, well, I couldn't get the CD out of my stereo fast enough.  I agree with reviewer Hakeem when he said that all these five-star reviews must be from people that are on the group's street team or something. Pretty Ricky consists of four people: three rappers (Spectacular, Diamond ""Baby Blue"", and Slick -- and I use the term ""rapper"" loosely) and one singer (Pleasure). The problem with this album is that these are the horniest AND most talentless guys I have ever heard of, and that is a terrible combination. The lead single ""Grind With Me"" is really called ""Grind On Me"", and it's one of the nastiest things I have ever heard, but ""Playhouse"" isn't far behind. And ""Nothing But a Number"" is very, very statutory.  Also annoying is their use of dated lyrics, like ""If lovin' you is wrong, I don't wanna be right"" on ""Grind On Me"", or ""If I'm lyin', I'm flyin'"" on ""Grill `Em"" (what does that even mean, anyway?). The guys also have a habit of continually yelling certain adlibs, like ""FROM THE BACK!"" on ""Get a Little Closer"", and ""Yes, sir!"" on ""Your Body"". Also, while Pleasure's singing isn't HORRIBLE, it's hard to listen to after all that wack rapping. Actually, his chorus on ""Shorty Be Mine"" is sure to cause you DISpleasure.  Speaking of that song, things are equally unimpressive when the guys DON'T talk about sex, like on ""Never Let You Go"", ""Can't Live Without You"", and the obligatory bling-blingin' songs ""Chevy"" and ""Grill `Em"". But in the long run I guess all that doesn't matter because nobody cares about Pretty Ricky any more and as my brother said, they're probably now back to working at Wendy's. If I ever come across the Bluestars CD again, in the words of ""Your Body"", dammit, I'll beat it up.  Anthony Ruper"
5,"Wow...what a great collection of songs, a wonderful album. I am a fan of the Church, but even if you have never heard of them, you will find this disc amazing. I am at a loss of words to decribe the songs. My only regret is that there is not a DVD of performances of these songs. I would go upstairs and watch it all night"
5,Really well done. This is an extremely well crafted CD. Six Days is probably the best song on here.  Note: The song when they're waiting for bow wow's car is       Ooh Aah - Grit
2,"I was unable to play in my car CD player, so only choice I got is to listen at home using my home DVD player."
1,"I have listened to this cd, also watched the dvd, of John Fogerty's long road home on amazon. Nothing can compare to his Dvd of Premonition.I own It love it, Put it on and  makes me  rock out, With one of the best entertainers In his prime time of life.The guitars and Instruments he plays is awesome to watch a legend of great talent.His voice Is so excellent & clear.Had some friends over with John's Premonition dvd playing.It took all of us back to that time In history.They all went to amazon and bought Premonition.I know soon they will all be gone.I went back to buy one more the price is so reasonable.As I consider Premonition to be a Collector's dvd.If you see it again.Do not wait buy it while they are available. I know its a Import as most dvds are today.Mine plays excellent In audio and picture.You feel like you are sitting in the audience with John performing.Give Premonition 10 Stars.Anything after John's Premonition dvd can not compare to it.No matter how hard they try to bring back his music on a Cd or a dvd.Premonition Is the best dvd  of all of times. All the rest get 1 Star for trying. Though not coming close to what I call  my Collector's Edition  dvd of John Fogerty's Prmonition. "
2,"Just listening to few extracts of Chopin Sonata on Amazon.com made it clear to me - I don't want to hear the rest. Let's take the Scherzo (2nd movement), for example. Lang Lang plays the middle episode not just ""a little slow"" but at least twice as slow. Whereas if you look in the score you'll see a strikingly different picture - Chopin (the composer!) asked for no tempo change, he never canceled Molto Vivace. Unfortunately, it is very common when a performer changes things here and there, so it sounds so called original and ""deep"", rather then trying to read attentively the composer's code, understand and make sense of it. I trust Chopin's genius and never those who put their ego above the existing Beauty.     "
2,"I dont see how anybody can call this an album. This is a mixtape. Lil Wayne basically freestyled through the whole album! The beats are bland and only a few of Wayne's freestyles are tight. Standout freestyles: THE MOBB, MONEY ON MY MIND, FIREMAN, OH NO, HIT EM'UP and IM A DBOY. Filler freestyles: shooter, receipt, grown man, feel me, hustler music, mo fire etc. lock and load is a boring track and Kurupt is whispering in the hook (WTF!). Its obvious that he was trying to get an up north fanbase to buy this s---. The majority of reviewers who gave him five stars come from up north. Lil Wayne's best albums are LIGHTS OUT AND THE CARTER. Lil Wayne at his worst: THE BLOCK IS HOT, 500 DEGREES and THE CARTER 2."
2,"I normally don't write reviews that are negative on amazon because they usually get nothing but negative feedback/unhelpful votes or whatever. So I shall try to be as fair as possible. I got Leonard Cohen's compilation ""i'm your man"" and there is this amazing, incredible rendition of ""if it be your will"" that Antony does. It was my favorite track on this record and the whole Leonard Cohen tribute concert in general, 'come so far for beauty' is really good. ""If It be your will"" was performed with such a soulful voice and i loved how it built inself until the end with the background vocals wailing and him stating the title words over and over. So I went to the library and waited a month to borrow this debut record by Antony; it was always checked out or on reserve. Yes, it was the same voice, and yes, I will say, Antony does have a very interesting and even somewhat beautiful voice. The album's sleeve put me off at first (and continued to do so). I am someone who often puts music together with its cover art (check out This Mortal Coil's 'song to the siren' with that perfect 23 envelope sleeve, for example). So I listened to this album a few times and was put off by the silly lyrics that actually made me grimace and cringe. ""mr muscles forcing bursting stingy little thingy into me . . ."" or ""i am so very happy, so please hit me"" or ""river of sorrow, don't swallow"" or the breathy way he says the word ""twilight"" don't know, it just made a little uncomfortable. So it seemed I didn't like the record.   Then I read an article in INTERVIEW magazine with Elton John about new music in 2005, he was praising Antony's second record. So I gave it another try and after three songs, couldn't handle it anymore. The images of the cd and the things he sings about or his presentation of the words ruin it. Maybe if he just sang songs by poets like Leonard Cohen it would be better? In the Elton John article, he said Antony sings a lot about sexuality, which I gathered from the lyrics, and but he presents his sexuality in such a pathetic way that almost says ""if you don't like me, or if you are not drawn to this sad life I am presenting to you, it's because you don't like gay/transgendered people"". In my case, that couldn't be further from the truth. I would not recommend this record to anyone, but when I mention it to people, I can't help but say how much I loved ""if it be your will"" and how disappointed I was in his solo effort."
2,"Sounds just like the last record if you ask me.  Always has a great band, arrangements, and mixing, but Bob's still trying to paint the picture of natural disasters, old cars, the dustbowl, Annie, Frannie, Sarah, Ruth and whatever other old timey nonsense he can come up with.  God bless him"
1,"I don't care what others stated...Sabata rushed the opera to fit the LP capability, Maria screamed at all times, no pianissimis, and everyone was super high charged like they must finish the recording on time to fit the album.  Best Tosca is Maria Callas with Pretre recording.  Don't buy this mono recording.  Maria did not understand who Tosca was during this moment"
2,"Aside from having what is possibly the most laughably awful name for a band I've ever heard, these guys just really don't do it for me.  A lot of the music is fairly decent, but the singer is just incredibly annoying.  Now, I am certainly not a stickler on vocal perfection, but this dude is really bad.  I've heard drunk guys in karaoke bars that I'd rather listen to.    But like I said, the band overall isn't completely terrible.  They're decent musicians, and I like a lot of the music, but I just really cannot get around that singer.  Ordinarily, it's not a good idea to judge a band by their name, but um...this isn't one of those times"
1,"perhaps it's a bit unfair because lucinda engenders such high expectations, but i was really disappointed with this record the songwriting is weak, the singing is weak, and the arrangements are dull  something kicked all the life out of the music--the songs are not all the same, but for some reason they all sound the same--and embarrassingly, you can sing most of them after one listen, they are so simplistic and cliched"
5,I love this new CD from Amos Lee.    The first single is entitled Shout Out Loud.  This song really puts me in a great mood.  His guitar playing is so energetic here.  My favorite track is Long Line Of Pain though.  It is a beautiful song about personal loss and loneliness. Sympathize is an another highlight on this disc.  Amos Lee's subtle voice is filled with compassion for people who are down on their luck.  Southern Girl is Amos' tribute to the  charm of a girl from the south.  Night Train is a very pretty love song. Skipping Stone is a bluesy sounding song about trying to move on after the loss of a loved one.  Freedom is an interesting track.  It is a reminder that the pursuit of  freedom should not lead to violence.  The lyrics of this song are true and thought provoking. Sweet Pea is a simple and sweet song about coming home to someone special.  Careless is an excellent song about the betrayal of a friend.  I love the feeling of loss and sense of  hurt in Amos' voice on this track.   Supply and Demand is a very entertaining CD by a talented young musician and song writer
2,"I got these CDs based on some reviews, but I can not take the singing.  There are far too many little kids singing, and the adults are no better.  It is WAY too gimmicky.  If you want just traditional songs sung nicely, this is not the set for you!  I am going to copy the songs I like and make my own CD - I think there are maybe 2 songs per CD I'll use!  BAD"
5,"Once again, Audra McDonald proves that she's the best musical theatre singer since Streisand. While many fans might quibble with her selections (mostly covers of rock and pop songs), her voice and her intepretations are seocnd to none"
2,"Although I'm a great fan of the brothers work, I feel this album an insult to the serious Bee Gees collector.  The tracks here are not rare, new or even unavailable.  Time for Barry & Robin to get back in there and give their army of fans a treat instead of another compilation rip-off.  Even Robin's latest redition ""A Live CD"" whoooooopie doo, again songs of old hat.....I'm hungry for new material not oldies.  And please don't get me wrong, it broke my heart when Maurice died, my world stopped and I do sympathise with Barry, Robin and the rest of their family.  Being a fan for 30 something years I've loved their music since the beginning and will carry on doing so for years to come....But please some new songs are needed from the brothers.  So come on Barry get together with Robin and show us the great writing talent you still have.  A devoted listener talisman, Dundee "
1,"The Black Eyed Peas are the WORST group is rap HISTORY! Its hard to believe that anyone could make music worse than the Black Eyed Peas. This group is an embarasment to Rap, Hip-Hop, R&B, and any other type of music ever created. How and why people continue to support these lame, extremely non-talented rejects of the rap world is completely unbelievable. I thought thier last CD was trash, but this has incredibly surpassed the low mark set by Elephunk, which should have been called, ""Hey let'sell out and attempt to create the worst music ever known to man"". The only good news is that theyll soon be forgotten about as they have just murdered thier musical careers, and will have to resort to doing jingles for commmercials in order to survive. These three unoriginal, talentless, boring, annoying, sellout, fake wanna-bes should stop making ANY kind of music and get completely out of the music business. Tonight I willl pray very hard that these bafoons of the music industry NEVER make another song EVER!!!! To say that they SUCK would be a compliment, they would have to practice constantly for the next 1,000 years THEN make a deal with the devil just to scrape up enough talent to suck! Theyre just that HORRIBLE!!"
1,"Jamie Foxx might be best known as a mediocre actor (with one good performance as ""Ray."").  But now he can best known now as a mediocre singer/writer.  While he has a good voice, he's either corny or has no hooks.  Basically, there is no substance but he figures he can capitalize after the movie ""Ray.""  And to anyone who says that he can write good songs, let's look at a song and see his wonderful poetic lyrics:   Yo you sleep  Naw I just um, I think I want some more  Yea I know we just got through  But its just so good, I just caint help it tho'  Its something about your body  Naw it aint all I think about  Well to be honest, oh   Im startin' to believe,  Something's wrong wit me,  Cause everyday, every night, every hour, every minute  I'm thinkin' `bout it  I can be at my job, in my car, up in church  And when I try to pray it off, it won't work  It seems that I caint get enough of   [Chorus:]  (Sex) All the time  (Sex) On my mind  (Sex) Everywhere I go  (Sex) I'm tryna let you know  (Sex) It's stronger than any drug even love  S-E-X ohhheee  (Sex) Can make you crazy  (Sex) Can make a baby  (Sex) All night long  (Sex) It's the perfect song  (Sex) Stronger than any drug even love  S-E-X oh   Its getting to the point where I (where I)  I watch it on TV when I buy DVDs  Thirty-nine ninety-nine for the new releases (39.99 for the new releases)  I aint proud of it, cause it's getting in the way of love for me  And I caint help it, caint shake it  (You know what) Sometimes I hear it calling me   [Chorus:]  (Sex) All the time  (Sex) On my mind  (Sex) Everywhere I go  (Sex) I'm tryna let you know  (Sex) It's stronger than any drug even love  S-E-X ohhheee  (Sex) Can make you crazy  (Sex) Can make a baby  (Sex) All night long  (Sex) It's the perfect song  (Sex) Stronger than any drug even love  S-E-X oh   Some call it bad, some call it good  Some do it bourgeois, some do it hood  I do it hood (can I say that one more time) girl I do it hood ohh   Some like it slow, some like it fast  It don't matter the tempo long as it lasts  I make it last (can I say that one more time) girl I make it last ohh    -Wow, that's a big pile of garbage!  Lyrics like that should easily win him a Grammy.  Keep it up, Jamie! "
2,"There are 3 or 4 good songs on this CD. If you want to purchase it to make your own compilation for your kids they will love a few of them. Others are WAY to slow and boring for kids to get excited about. There are a couple of them that make no sense at all on a chilren's CD. It seems like they couldn't decide whether to make a CD to put kids to sleep or to pep them up so they did both on one CD. That doesn't work for my kids. John Lithgow ""Singin in the Bathtub"" is a MUCH better choice. The songs are upbeat and lively. My kids ask for that one all the time"
5,"Like all of Antony's Music, this EP has a chilling and superhuman quality to it. Unlike his other stuff, the production is toned down on the non-album tracks (""The Lake"" and ""The Horror Is Gone"") to a stark, white-faced beauty that for me defines the core of Antony & The Johnsons. The album track, ""Fistful of Love"", is one of my favourite Antony songs, a soulful and grooving lament that makes a convincing argument for masochism as an uplifting and redemptive fetish.  Though the price is a bit steep, this is a great addition to any Antony fan's library"
4,"I am not a CLAY-MATE... howver, Clay Aiken is without-a-doubt the best runner-up from any season of AI.  That being said...I still wasn't sure if I would like this CD.  And I didn't---at first.  But then, after hearing it a few more times, I actually grew to like most of the songs.  Not all of them, which is why I didn't give him 5 stars, but it is a very good album.  My favorite happens to be the title track.  But, there are several more good songs on the CD.  Whether or not you are into this style of music, you can't argue that Clay Aiken has one of the best male voices around.  Probably the best male voice of his age.  I would recommend this CD to any one who is into Adult Contemporary.  Of course, if you are a Clay-mate, then I don't have to tell you anything :"
1,"As a big fan of the Postal Service (their ""Give Up"" easily makes the cut on my top 10 albums), I had high expectations for this Dntel record, as Jimmy Tamberello is one half of the Postal Service. BIG mistake. Listen to the samples: if you like what you hear, then buy it; if you don't like what you hear, don't make my mistake of thinking that the songs get better beyond the 30 seconds given. Worthwhile songs on this CD: 1)""(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan"" (The Postal Service remix is available on iTunes, and is a better version than what's on the CD), sung by Ben Gibbard of Death Cab and Postal Service. 2)""Last Songs"" is if anything, relaxing. I recommend getting these two songs on iTunes and leaving it at that, save some money.  The CD's too expensive for two decent songs.  Jimmy Tamberello has another digital project that he works called Figurine and (more recently) James Figurine, it's essentially a catchier, poppier version of Dntel, more in line with Postal Service"
4,"This is a very different sounding Paul Simon album.  The influence of Brian Eno is obvious and at times over-the-top.  My conclusion, now that I've had this album for a while, is that it's not one that I'm constantly listening to but, when I'm in the mood, this is really an interesting and fun album.  Occasionally, Paul reaches heights I don't feel he's reached since Graceland.  There are some great songs on here.  If you're looking for ""Still Crazy after all these years"" or ""50 Ways to Leave Your Lover"" - type songs, you're not going to find them here.  If you're interested in hearing Paul push the envelope, however, this is the one.  Paul hits the mark more often than he misses it on this one"
1,"I have always admired the experimental spirit in any artist. As a visual artist I am constantly trying new things in my work and every once in a while I stumble upon some new element or concept that withstands the ""look at it a week from now and see how you feel"" test. Other times I churn out pieces of junk which I spare the world from looking at. Animal Collective should have reconsidered releasing this often silly and pointless collection of sounds. It is an artistic experiment that failed. I hope this is only true about this particular disc (the only AC I have heard) as it would be a shame for someone to be consistently putting out pieces of artistic crap for any length of time and still be getting away with it."
2,"I have decided to compose an album of mostly kindergarten children yelling about cats while someone opens and closes the door to a beginner's music class, and I will call it art.  People will write many reviews about the music, and they will say it is wonderful, and that it captures the essence of youth while retaining the wisdom of the ages.  They will do this because they are afraid to say that is stinks.  Music is not suppossed to hurt the ears.  To call this good music is an insult to good musicians.    I will give them credit for being brave enough to buy massive quantities of drugs from some dealer, for clearly they were higher than a kite, no, make that a weather ballon, when they composed the album.  Creative; maybe.  Listenable, enjoyable, humable, playable when company is over; no"
1,"I'm going to start this off by saying that I am NOT the biggest Andrew Lloyd Webber fan.  Some of his works are amazing, like Joseph and various songs from each of his musicals, yet overall he tries to incorporate a very fake sounding pop opera into most of his shows.  Unfortunately, The Woman in White, his first try at gothic opera, is even worse. Webber obviously tried to pretend that the score for the musical was quality, thought-provoking work by jam-packing it with dissonant chords and loud orchestrations, but they only show how little he truly knows about music.  Half of the show's score is little short of random notes that seem to have no connection (almost as if he tried to imitate the genius of Sondheim).  The tunes are bland, the book is boring and confusing, and many of the performances are sub-par.  For instance, the actrees portraying the Woman in White simply shrieks throughout the entire CD.  Even when she sings, her screaming din hurts one's ears.  It seems as if she decided to cover the underdevelopment of her character with noise.  The other actors are generally adequite, yet they have so little to work with that their portrayals seem dull. Admittedly, there are some highlights to this CD, such as Crawford's amazing portrayal of Count Fosco (especially the live version of You Can Get Away With Anything...it is HILARIOUS!), but overall, the CD is hard to take in.  Some songs are quite beautiful, yet the track on which they resign are also full of shrieking, dull dialogue, and loud music.  I think it is a tell-tale sign of a flop when on a live-version CD of a musical, only one song is accompanied by reaction from the audience"
1,"Boy, and I thought ""Cats"" was bad. This is the single most boring, stupid, pointless and utterly awful piece of music garbage that has ever had the misfortune to befoul my ears. There is no story line, no range in music, no feeling, no lyrics to back up the awful music. I mean, the list could go on forever. I warn you, it's the biggest waste of $25.00 that you might, no, will ever spend. PLEASE, do yourself a favor and trust me. DON""T BUY THE CD!!! And if you do, when you put it on, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.You've been warned. Now please, spend your well earned money on something that actually has a purpose in life"
5,"If you like this album, if you like the title track, it might inspire a few hard core fans to know that the original inspiration for both the name of the band, and especially the title track, is the masterpiece of a western, ""Bad Company""- 1972.  The whole piano instrumental is practically lifted from the film's soundtrack, by ""Fantasticks"" Harvey Schmidt.  The song is a very haunting one which was a bit of an enigma for me until I saw the film itself.  It stars Barry Brown and Jeff Bridges.  It's worthwhile for not only western fans of every considerable imagination, but to fans of the band itself, to help make the song more meaningful, as it has for me!!  I highly recommend them both"
5,"I have held back from doing an online review because I recognize that my objectivity isn't well, very objective when it comes to Elton John.  I love everything he does (even ""Victim of Love""!).  But I could no longer resist.  This CD is magnificent.  Elton John and Bernie Taupin have crafted a work that spans generations, bridges gaps and even pays homage to personal and artistic lapses over the years.  It is an honest, courageous and celebratory reflection of the terrain these two geniuses have traversed over some 37 years.  That's the depth of ""The Captain and the Kid.""  But let's not get lost in the depths here, either.  This CD is one great listen.  Even if you're not interested in the history...even if you're just a casual fan (can one just be a casual Elton John fan??)  or just like good music, ""The Captain and the Kid"" is great entertainment.  It has it all...great arrangements, great piano playing from Elton and of course, hooks abound.  No one...that's right, no one can write a hook like Elton.  These songs stay with you...they become your companions on YOUR journey, and like good wine, they get better and better.  I must also write a word of support for all who have written regarding so many artists doing retreads of old standards/hits.  I know, I know, this stuff is selling like there's no tomorrow.  I suppose, as much as I can't bear another Rod Stewart retread CD ( I loved Rod though most of his career...I just can't stand what he's done over the last five years...Rod...please STOP!) I guess the attraction/appeal of these CD's is that the buyer knows they're going to get a full CD's worth of good (or at least known) songs from a reliable artist.  True, it is not as easy as it used to be to find many CD's today that are original and good from start to finish...CD's tend to be longer than LP's and therefore run the risk of running out of steam, and let's face it...many do. Oh, the classic CD's, they're out there, you might have to do some mining before striking gold, however.  Sadly, ""The Captain and the Kid"" did not ignite the charts.  I cannot understand it. And I do realize that popularity has nothing to do with greatness. Yet, this IS truly a great CD, a work of art that deserves to be heard.  It is a throw back to the glory days, yet it is not dated in the least. And one listen...just one puts you right back on the yellow brick road, platform shoes and all! No, I suppose you can't go back...not totally anyway, but it is oh so nice take one more sweet ride with The Captain and the Kid. "
1,Hank III has done nothing but prove what a whiner he is by trashing other artists.  I have not heard one song on here that suggests any artistic ability.  This guy needs to clean up his mouth and worry about himself instead of trashing others
2,"Because I like faster music with a beat that makes me tap a foot, I only liked the cut ""Lucky To Know You.""  ""Seeing Through You"" is all right, too.  Perhaps Reynolds will independently release a CD of his own with more songs like ""Lucky To Know You."" "
4,"Be Human does not disappoint! It has sound quality mixed in with sound fx and acoustic and classical and when I say 4stars I mean it. When I say 5stars I usually mean a ten. Were I to do sound for a futuristic play I would feel gratified in using some of this. I think Yoko Kanno knows the Secret of Life and she shares her formula...with us, time-and-time again. I happened to be spoiled on her earlier works and always long for those type masterpieces; but if I had to choose american rhythm or Yoko Kanno, I would choose Yoko Kanno. I wonder if she's ever been nominated for a grammy? In my book she's world-class!As-I-said-before this cd does not disappoint and there are enough tracks on it to justify  four-stars. No worries here"
5,This is one of my favorite releases from Common. This chi town warrior crafted an underground release that will bring a vibrant smile to the hardcore hip hop head and even awaken the minds of some of the fake commercial rap artist lovers. Songs like I used to love h.e.r and ressurection start the classic album and take you on the road to classic chicago hip hop. Not only the lyrics are dope but also the beats and the hooks. This is a pivotal album that needs to be in everyone's collectio
1,This must be the record for quickest backslide I've ever seen.  He went from U Saved Me to a potty-mouthed melodramatic soap opera that has already gotten old. This all shows he wasn't sincere about his spirituality. All the praise and glorifying was just relief of being given a free pass for using the wrong thing as a urinal.  I admit I was intrigued and entertained with Trapped in the Closet; but the continuations are just getting more and more ridiculous. To continue to extend the installments until you eventually get to Chapter 100 (which seems to be his plan to hear him tell it) is unacceptable
2,"I have always liked R. Kelly's music.  When he produced ""Trapped in the Closet"", I thought it was a joke.  This is one of the stupidest, corniest, and blandest song I heard."
2,"Juvenile has been at the bottom and the top in his career.  He marinated on the underground until Cash Money exploded into the rap arena as well as mainstream radio in the mid-to-late 90s.  But then people got tired of hearing the same ole product that the label had to offer.  Even labelmates were getting sick of each other and the politics that was going down, leaving some to either depart or find other ways of getting their name out there.  B.G. went the independent route, holding on to a small fraction of the fans he had when he was a Hot Boy.  Turk followed suit, but soon found himself behind bars instead of spitting bars.  Juvenile found himself going the solo route, although he did briefly return in 2003 for Juve The Great.  Now with Atlantic, Juvi has some catching up to do with his newest release Reality Check.  ""Get Your Hustle On"" is the perfect track to start off the album because it shows that Juvenile knows what he needs to do to get ahead.  ""I Know You Know"" with Trey Songz is a good contender for the radio.  ""Around The Way"" is a song for the hood to know that he ain't never left and he doesn't plan to either.  ""Sets Go Up"" with Wacko is so-so, while his first single ""Rodeo"" is the millennium version of ""Back That [...] Up"" only with a more subdued approach.  Unfortunately the album takes a nosedive from there.  ""What's Happenin'"" is nothing to write home about, ""Loose Booty"" is another song devoted to the [...]-shaking community, and ""Break A Brick Down"" deliberately borrows a beat from another Cash Money track. ""Who's Ya Daddy"" is pointless, along with the annoying ""Keep Talkin'"" with Skip and Redd Eyezz and ""Why Not.""  Bun B makes another poor decision by collaborating on ""Rock Like That.""  The biggest shocker has to be ""Addicted"" with Brian McKnight making a dumb career move. Not only does Brian sing vulgar lyrics for the first time (and hopefully his last,) but Juvenile decides to talk his verses instead of rapping them (think Oran Juice Jones when he was cussing the chick out at the end of ""The Rain."")    There are a lot of other dreadful songs on Reality Check that I'm not even going to bother mentioning.  This has to be the worst disc that Juvenile has ever put together in recent memory.  With an occasional track here and there that is even tolerable, Reality Check is not something you want to cop unless you are his biggest fan and can't live with yourself if you don't buy the album.  One thing is for sure...Juvenile better consider a legitimate reality check if he wants to stay in the rap game for years to come. "
2,"There are a couple OK tracks on this disc but this is far and away NOT the same Lost Trailers that put out some of my favorite music of the past few years.  Gone are the well crafted, story like lyrics and any sound of Southern rock. Those great stories (Longfall, Pontchartrain, Love & War, West End, Dougherty County, Under FM Waves and SO many more) and great music (See above as well as Red Sun, Sitting on Top of the World and Down in the Valley) have been replaced by Gravy, Dixie Boy Special & I'm a Country Man and the same old radio friendly country sound you can hear from anyone.  The sad irony in this are the lyrics to Under FM Waves (from New Age Cowboy) and how they talk about how much great music resides off radio--and look at what has happened: songs to created to make it on radio (which granted, should make them big).  Try their other 3 available cd's (Story of the New Age Cowboy, Trailer Trash and Welcome to the Woods). They have some other very hard to find music out there but these 3 should be available (Trailer Trash is a mix of songs from Rock Band, songs that ended up on Welcome, etc).  P.S. to the last review--Ryder Lee is the lead vocalist. Geoffrey Stokes Neilson is the guitarist and lead songwriter. "
1,"BE doesn't live up to the hype?  Whoever wrote that editorial needs to be punished. The court jester doesn't deserve to live.  Not only does BE live up to the hype; BE is the hype.  Common and Kanye reminiscent of Quincy and Michael, the early years.  When Michael was still black and male.  Simply stated, BE flows.  If BE were any tighter we couldn't afford it.  No need to skip or go back. Just enuff songs to make you listen to it again.  Great work of art.  Common and Kanye - damn!!!!"
1,"I read recently that Sheryl Crow's song ""Good is Good"" a song from her new album, was nominated for a Grammy award. Seriously,how much time and effort could it possibly take to come up with that. TNMC, also won a Grammy when it was released. I still can not understand why, but I do have a theory. Simply put, the music industry is more interested in image than musical talent and integrity. While only a mediocre talent at best,Sheryl Crow is deified. I realize that this is only my opinion(and I have a right to state it) this type of music nauseates me. There is so much music throughout the world to be explored and appreciated. Do not let some in the music industry to bombard and assault you with this type of musical drek. I do have a solution: all the record producers and industry personnel responsible for the above-mentioned ""crimes"" should all be sentenced to a jail term for however long it takes them to recognize true talent and get some ""SOUL."" Peace"
1,"And folk revivalism is what it is, folks; I'll label it even if the populists fume at me because I know of more than 5 genres.  Meloy admits in interview after interview his taste for the Fairport Convention, Pentangle, and above all Shirely Collins.  He even did an album of ""covers"" of Shirley Collins' arrangements of British traditionals, a ridiculous concept if I ever heard of one.  Why cover another singer's versions of TRADITIONAL songs?  This idiocy should evince Meloy's alienation from a long tradition of reinterpretations of British folk music, and indeed most of his oeuvre consists of feeble attempts at ballad composition.  With no prosodic skill, he goes about constructing narratives modeled on such work as Shirley Collins' repertoire.  Evidently Meloy believes he can pen ballads as if he were a Walter Scott, S.T.C. or John Keats, but his weak stories show throughout the imaginative poverty of an American desperately attempting to beat an escape to the land of faerie.  The wistfulness and Romantic nostalgia of Meloy's work come off as trite and calculated for NPR yuppies.  Moreover, his vocal range consists entirely of yelp, melancholy warble and nasal whine--this whingeing troubadour sounds as if he constantly has a cold.  I'll admit the band is at least competent, but do yourself a favor: buy Comus' ""First Utterance,"" the Incredible String Band's ""The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter"" or Shirley Collins' ""No Roses"" instead"
5,"This album showcases Collin Raye's amazing tenor to the fullest. Hits like ""Love Me,"" ""Little Rock,"" ""My Kind of Girl,"" ""Not That Different,"" and ""I Can Still Feel You"" are featured on this brilliant album. Raye's vocals are well done, as is the song selection. Most of the songs are ballads, Raye's specialty. If you are a fan of Collin Raye, then this album is a must-have."
1,"I'm sorry but children that try to rap are just horrible. They are just a gimmick like the old school r and b artists that would come out called teeny boppers. I guess this lil one wants to be a ""hip hop teeny bopper"". Well guess what? You don't get teeny bopper reviews, you get grown up one's. Please stop rapping and go to college (or work as a mechanic) like a normal kid should"
5,"Though Dylan and the Band had played together a lot before this record (the Basement tapes and the 1967 tour), this is the first recording of them together that was released and I must say the Band's playing on this record is vastly different than those times, different than the live ""Before the Flood"" as well. I get almost a lose, playful feeling from them here, driven by Garth's excellent keyboards and Robbie's stunning guitar work. Love songs, dirges, uplifting songs, tough songs and torch songs, this is a record for the ages. Yes, it was overshadowed by ""Blood on the Tracks,"" but it's been years now and still ""Planet Waves"" stands the test of time. I really like this record"
1,"Believe it or not, I had actually expected to hate this because it just doesn't suit me for the good kind of music. It sounds just the way I thought it would sound: crappy. It isn't hard enough to be all that good if you ask me. It is just too calm. {And now you probably think I'm a hypocrite because I like Enya}. At least Enya doesn't sound like someone who sounds like they are in a garage band attempting to record bad music. Not my style."
1,"Sorry, I thought this would be a great updated version of the classic SHR music - and I was really disappointed. I don't really understand the point of this album - why ""remake"" music that was timeless and pretty much perfect in the first place?  I can't imagine my own kids actually learning anything from these remakes (and bottom line, wasn't that the point?)... and listening to ""No More Kings"" was downright depressing - when SHR has always had the exact-opposite effect!"
1,"Now I have heard a lot of people say that this is a classic, and that it may be the most creative CD of all time, but when I take a listen, I just laugh. There are so many better rappers who have a million times the talent that Missy Elliot has and are so much more creative. Honestly, and the lyrics are awful, only a couple of the beats are okay, but after listening to Missy Elliot's annoying voice, then you will be very frustrated like I was that I bought this"
1,"What a thought provoking and creative album title.I wonder how long it took her to come up with that name?I cant believe the trendy garbage people listen to these days.All the songs sound the same and have the same pointless lyrics to them.She cant produce,rap write or do much of anything of value.I saw this trash at tower records and it was just collecting dust.Save your money and dont buy any of her worthless junk ever again.Listen to some real artists like black sabbath,judas priest or iron maiden.Dont forget to vote for my review"
5,"If you are looking for just a general overview of Iggy's career, I'd say this is a pretty good way to go.  It contains a bit of music from each section of his career"
5,"This motion picture soundtrack is the best! That`s my opinion anyway; the movie (National Treasure - Starring: Nicolas Cage) has been one of my top favorites ever since it came out. I also recommend the ""Titanic"" soundtrack as well if you are interested in this one. And if you have doubts as to whether or not to buy this CD, try listening to the clips. My personal favorite is: ""National Treasure Suite"" (Track 1). The Tracks: ""Library of Congress"" (Track 4), and ""Declaration of Independence"" (Track 2) are nice slower ones. Track: ""Spectacle Discovery"" (Track 10) is another one of my favorites also. Some of the tracks on this CD can be a little repetitive, but all in all, I think this CD is worth the money"
5,This CD is a must have if you are a Hot Boys (Old school Cash Money) fan
2,"...don't buy this CD.  Most of this is emo, and quite a bit of it is meandering and not particularly catchy.  There are a few good bands on this CD--enough to merit maybe listening to it once or twice, but it's not worth your time if you're an actual punk fan.  It has an interesting mix of music, but it doesn't fit together too well.  The upsides to this compilation are as follows:  one, the Dropkick Murphys song, and two, it's inexpensive.  However, it's even less expensive to just forget about buying this CD at all"
1,How can they even call this punk. Were's six feet under or slayer. Maybe some cibo matto. These are the bands they need to add....... Not yellowcard and other crummy emo band
2,"RBX is one of my favorite rappers, he has a dark, sinister style. Instead of dropping a unique, straight hip hop album(which is what I was expecting). He decided to make a g-funk album co-starring his whole muthaf@$#ing family.This is more of a compilation because RBX only does a small handfull of songs solo, and predictably, those ones are basicly the best tracks with the exception of the snoop and daz collabos. So RBX I ask you, why would you try to make an album featuring mostly talentless artists on your record label, when you could have done a REAL DOPE solo album (how do I miss Heatmizer) and package a compilation of your artists with the album? I could not be more disappointed. I would rather spend my 11.99 on anything but this cd, Sorry X, you wasted your talent on this album, dont be mad at me"
4,"Seth Maheu ""College Student""....your high. remedy is probably the song i like LEAST on this album. i hate it. the rest of the songs are awesome though, my favs are ""because of me"" ""world falls away"" ""tongue"" and ""simplest mistake"". this cd is a solid effort.  and seth, you know Ef all about music. the fact u like remedy the best, and suggested that anything by lloyd banks is worth buying shows you have terrible taste. Jurrassic 5 are good, but ""amazing lyricism""?? no. jurrasic 5 are good because they are fun, and keep the forumla simple and old school. true hip hop. but there are LEGIONS of more talented emcees.   dont EVER say anything about lloyd banks again. he is terrible and makes outdated, gangster BS. he should get over himself and stop furthering the stereotypes everyone has of hip-hop. hip-hop has a terrible name becuase of losers like him, 50, ja, and eminem (yeah he USED to be good).  BUY THIS SEETHER ALBUM"
1,I am only in my 20's but I did grow up listening to the original album of A Chorus Line (my mom used to play it while we were cleaning) and I gotta say that this remake is awful.  The original cast had great passion in their voices and the new cast is very blah.  I don't recomend this at all.  If you really love and appreciate the music find a copy of the orginal and I know that you will enjoy it much better
2,"There are several questions I have after listening to this CD.  Why are the tempos so crazy?  The opening number plods along like a funeral march, while At The Ballet zips past as if the performers are on crank.  Part of me suspects that cast is performing against a pre-recorded accompaniment track.  Why does everything sound so thin?  These orchestrations were created to achieve maximum resonance in live acoustic settings.  On this CD, it's like every single instrument is separately mic'ed and mixed to within an inch of its life, sometimes to the detriment of the overall sound.  Sometimes, obviously live instruments sound like MIDI.  Usually it's the sound engineer's job to make the opposite happen!  Why are the vocals so ""hot""?  In the OBC, there were occasions when the entire chorus would get overwhelmed by reverb and full-sounding orchestra.  Now it's the vocals that tear at the balance.  Who cast this show?  I'm not going to single any one cast member out because it would rude, but -- oh screw it.  You deserve to know.  This Cassie is some serious vocal ugly.  I didn't once wonder along with Zach why she was stuck auditioning on the line, like I did with Ms. Donna McKechnie's fabulous triple threat.  Why not update some of the orchestrations?  I have a deep and abiding respect for Jonathan Tunick (who is among my top three favorite Broadway creative types), but it's 2006.  Wah wah pedals are out.  Overall, although this CD is good for completists, it's not going to knock the OBC recording out of it's slot as the definitive A CHORUS LINE recording.  If you don't have a Chorus Line CD and are trying to decide which one to buy, track down the re-mastered version of the original broadway cast.  It's vintage, but it has a raw warmth that is missing from the revival cast"
2,"That moron who said their music hasent changed is so dumb and obviousley not a true SOAD fan. Ive been a SOAD fan since they were just a small band with loads of potential. SOAD was a great album and Toxicity was sweet and Steal This Album was really a great musical adventure but this album just isnt SOAD at all. Ok in all fairness if I was writing this review and this was their debut album great album overall reallly a 4.5/5 truthfully. But compared to their earlier work this just doenst cut it, their older stuff was way way better then this crap. And Daron should stop trying to get so much singing time in he really isnt that good of a singer and Serj is much better"
5,"Absolutely great collection of Alan Jackson's best, without the filler.  A must-have.  By the way, is everyone laughing yet at the 9/2/01 reviewer who suggested that Alan Jackson's ""songwriting skills need work""?!"
4,"In 1987 Barry, Robin, and Maurice were reunited! Or at least that's how new distributor Warner Brothers tried to sell it.  Even though the brothers never really left themselves or us, but  I digress.  I only have this album on cdr, since Warner's seemed to make the release very scarce.  The cover is cool, though.  The boys look totally different from when audiences remembered them last. No white, no hair, well not as much anyway.  Black. Dark, edgy.  I'm Pip and I've come to play!          ESP is naturally the song to lead off the album.  It is different from any other project the Brothers did at the time.  Better than Walls Have Eyes, more polished than Now Voyager.  However, ESP is also very stand alone on this album and nothing else here sounds like it.  (Not that I mind that of course.)  We heard some of Robin's coming out voice party on Living Eyes, but in songs shared with Baz.  Barry moved onto some heavy producing, but without Robin.  ESP brings them together again and slams both powerhouses.  There is so much going on in this song, you can imagine this is what a telepath hears. Noise, each trying to have its own say, competing with everything else that is heard, and all of it's important.  Brilliant.          Ah, You Win Again.  Although not as well know in the US as the Fever Monsters, this song is indeed one of those monster songs that you just have to love.  There are so many hooks, lines, and sinkers musically, lyrically, vocally. From the whole second verse's play on `Nobody stops this body' to Robin's Oh Baby! wail to that bombing drum throughout.  Hot damn.  This song did actually even encroach the US charts, imagine that!         Live Or Die (Hold Me Like A Child)  (What is it with them and parenthesis?) is the first slow song presented.  Barry returns to his shrill notes and sometimes the versus are tough to understand.  The chorus is strong and the lyrics as always are top notch.  The ad-libbed over the top ending is perfect eighties power ballad fashion.  The music and high voices are a little dated, but you can't help but try and sing along when your driving home alone late at night, or is that just me?          Giving Up The Ghost  sound a bit more like the tracks on Walls Have Eyes, but that's ok. Great music rifts.  Some of the refrains are a bit much, and one of the times where I might say the chorus is the weaker part of the song. Then again, the boys hold out `Ghooooost!' and it sounds cool again.  Robin sounds great in the verses, since you can understand him seventy percent of the time.  ;0)        The Longest Night is one of the hotter Bee Gees songs in my opinion, just like Bodyguard.  After their solo and side projects in the early eighties, the brothers came back for ESP stronger again.  Robin with this song has somehow managed to combine the weeping Joke sound with the booming voice he developed post Fever.  The vibrato was always there, but the five o'clock shadow eighties sounds fit Robin's haunting lyrics as the sixties mellow sound did.   Indeed ESP together with Walls Have Eyes is a dang good hunk of Gibb material that it seems everyone missed. Pity.          Every album has to have a fun song and This Is Your Life is ESP's.   It's nice to see the Brothers come back and kind of laugh off and yet embrace their past music.  The lyrics `line-drop' titles of other Bee Gees songs during the interlude.  Can I tell you this is the only time I sing to `JJJive Talkin'!  It's Barry rapping but with dribs and drabs from the old songs cutting in and out. Very cool.  I could recommend the entire album on that interlude alone if I had to, but I don't.         Outside of its sweet and soft lyrics and vocals, Angela  is in my mind a little bit of a statement song.   Sometimes it feels like you can almost exchange `Angela' for `America'.  Followed by the line `I'm still alive', I wonder if the boys were making a veiled statement at us stubborn Yanks.  Indeed they were still alive, and maybe this is also a pun on Stayin' Alive. The New York times effect a man, remember.  ;0)  The feel of the song is so innocent and easy feeling, but I suspect more!  The girl that got away? I think not.          Maurice brings this album to a standstill with Overnight.  It's the closest in vein to the song ESP.  Maurice, however, adds not telepathy, but animal magnetism.  It's a different kind of psychic sense.  The lyrics  are so detailed and the interlude combining the echo of all three voices is exceptional.  The music has, if there is such a thing, a predatory feeling that's good.  By the end of the song you are totally sold and yelling back, ""All right I'll stay!""         In the eighties and later on High Civilization, The Brothers seem to have a little Motown tribute revival thing going. Crazy For Your Love is fascinating in that it is has a Motown throwback vibe and at the same time, it's straight eighties bubblegum pop.  (Tiffany, anyone?)  I would cringe if I heard some tween today singing any song about love and ice cream .  However, play Crazy for a kid today, they will like it, and never know it is old men singing in 1987!  How ingenious is it to find such a timeless song here?!         Backtafunk  is not your traditional Gibb song.  It sounds a bit...I want to say New Edition! Naturally the brothers master all the hip beats and singing, even if the lyrics are slightly bland.  Again however, the breakaway interlude makes the song.  The harmony and fun of the boys come in and the song kicks up to another level.  Is Barry scatting? Incredible!         ESP ends with the ESP Vocal Reprise, and I don't really know why.  Its  just the opening echo of the voices on the first track, but it does sound cool. Allow me to mention the oddities associated with ESP, as you knew there would be some! Young Love is an unreleased cut that didn't make the album.  I managed to download a piece that cuts short, but it's heavy in the low key Maurice vein.  Honestly I don't know why it was cut.  The 1989 compilation Tales From The Brothers Gibb contains an ESP Demo that is very similar to the final version, just missing a few production marks.  Fans should also check out The One For All Tour VHS and DVD for concert footage of the boys singing Giving Up The Ghost and extras from One.          Warner Brothers does not realize The Bee Gees quality they possess, and they should re-release ESP.  I wonder if this album planned to have any sort of theme to it? Each song touches a different type of emotion and vibe, and aren't songs in a way a psychic connection from one person to another? Interesting theory, Kristin. Interesting. "
1,"Hooba...stank...stinks and will always stink. I don't know about the rest of the CD, but listening to The Reason is about as pleasant as sticking your hand into a running garbage disposal.  I'm not a perfect perrrrsssonn. Egad"
1,"I was just speechless when i first heard this. What was known as the best heavy metal band on earth 10 years prior, has become a lion without balls or teeth. Country-influenced tunes!? Slow, blues-influenced songs? NO way, NO thanks.  Also a very overrated album. The Black Album was OKAY but 3 stars in my book..but man this was a sharp right turn for them and the beginning of the end for Metallica.PS: The Memory Remains and Unforgiven 2 are HORRIBLE SONGS."
5,"These guys are the best group out right now. Every single rapper is AMAZING even Bizarre who is not great so far as flow but probably has the funniest lyrics. This album brought me some of my favorite songs to date including Sh*t Can Happen, Pistol Pistol, Ain't Nuttin' But Music, American Psycho, Fight Music & Revelation. My favorite rappers are Swifty & Eminem but the fact is every one should have a solo album out by now (besides Em, only Proof (R.I.P.) & Bizarre do... which are my least favorite rappers in the group) Every song is great even the skits are enjoyable. If you don't have this yet, you are missing out on one of the best cds ever"
5,"OK...there may be alot of songs on here that you don't know from her Hollywood films, but don't let that stop you.  She is marvelous and fun!  Another reviewer said they were disappointed with this...ignore them and buy it"
5,"The music in this musical uncannily remains faithful to ABBA music and the story line which was written to showcase the music.  I saw the Las Vegas production, not the the original London production yet the music sung and played in the LV production was just as fantastic as that within the original production. If you like ABBA,(and who does not?) and cannot spring for the price of a ticket, this DVD is the next best thing"
5,My only regret was not getting this album sooner.  The music and lyrics are real and unpretentious.  Wayne Hancock is a true American gem
1,"let's just get this out of the way now. maysa? i'm on your team babes, but this cd just hasn't done it for me. i got your 1st cd & was hooked. i waited for the next & was floored! not in a good way! the cd jacket was so drab & tired, just like damn near every song inside the case. i let it sit on my shelf & decided to give it a listen again. still i didn't feel it. it's in my car right now & i still can't get through it all. i'm still on your team though. i have your latest & i play it 2 death. over & over. cd's 1 & 3 are both must haves. but this 1 stinks"
2,"Jerry, si estas leyendo esto: Creo que todos estamos de acuerdo en decir que eres un cantante excepcional. Te queremos mucho!!!  Pero queremos que vuelvas a cantar salsa, como la del tiempo de ""Cuenta Conmigo"", ""Cara de Nino"", y ""Magia""...  No te dejes influenciar por la musica que esta de moda hoy, el reggaeton no te va!!! No me malinterpretes: hasta tu disco ""Vuela muy alto"" me encanto, pero creo que ahora es tiempo de volver a la musica que mejor te queda. Seguire escuchando tus discos de salsa anteriores hasta que vuelvas a sacar uno nuevo.  Vamos, por favor, te lo rogamos!!! Te quiere tu fan DJ LOLA, desde Montreal, Canada"
5,"""The Who Sell Out"" is one among ( at least 3 ) several Who master pieces. With its build up as a commercial radio station program with commercials in between the songs and overall great songwriting, the album may very well be the most varied and most entertaining Who album.  1967 was a year of psychedelia in rock music and the Who were among the pioneers of that trend. This is obvious from the first track of the album ""Armenia in the Sky"". The outstanding single ""I Can See For Miles"" is among the very best psychelia songs recorded.   The acoustic ""Mary Anne With the Shaky Hand"" is another Who favourite - beautiful melody, great rhythm and intelligent lyrics.  Actually the lyrics are overall great on this album  - with wit and homour.  Songs like ""Odorono"" and ""Tattoo"" are rarely included on Who compilations - and they're both bound to be great positive surprises to the first-time listener of the album.   ""Our Love Was"" and ""I Can't Reach"" are other fine tracks - both more in the style of their previous album ""A Quick One"".   I might be expected that the short commercials ( most of them musically done ) would be annoying after the first couple listens - but this is really not the case. These short tracks works great in the context of the album.   Only the final two tracks of the original album seem a little out of place. Townshend's acoustic ""Sunrise"" is quite beautiful, but ""Rael"" feels somewhat longwinded and dated.  Most of the bonus-tracks are great - most of the apparently were only left out due to lack of space on the vinyl format.   Try to shuffle the tracks - the bonus-tracks really fit in nicely with the originals."
5,"This album demonstrates the musical mastery of the legendary Who. It's also interesting how today's groups like Green Day and Limp Bizkit don't even close to the Who. And to Orion, a reviewer on this forum, you're a sad case, my friend. I sincerely hope that you successfully seek out the psychological help that you so desperately are in need of"
1,"The Who don't have any talent. They are overrated, and only made 1 decent song in Wont Get Fooled Again. Avoid this lousy compilation and get Dire Straits Making Movies insted"
4,"I was introduced to MCR through Three cheers for sweet revenge, which is one of the best albums to ever be released. I brought you my bullets, you brought me your love is a very, very good release. All the songs are awesome, and the intensity and ferocity that drew me MCR in the first place is well in place on this album. But, it seems that they were still finding their sound and direction on this album. Very good album, but the recording is very raw, semi-okay production. But nevertheless a great release that you must check out...My favorite song is Drowning lessons"
1,how all yall fools gonna come up in here calling this trash gangsta.. Kali is where the real ridas live and die notthe dirty.. DIRTY... south or the LEAST coast.. everyone since the mid 90's has bitten the west coast and this is no exception.. tha frontlinerz have a track called ''gangsta in me'' and they put it right on these so-called gangsta's callin themselves trap ni66az.. this is a joke.. like everything else and whoever said this isnt commercial.. give it up.. this record is sitting on wal-marts shelves!!! i heard this and had one serious laugh.. boyz n da hood... another example of how you suckers bite the west..
4,"Few people are aware that Dave Thomas, in addition to being the founder and spokesman of the Wendy's hamburger chain, was also the leader of Pere Ubu. Clearly Mr. Thomas wasn't in it for the money, since he made his fortune selling good old-fashioned hamburgers, and so he was free to pursue his own musical muse. The results are sometimes splendid, sometimes things go awry, but it's always the unique stylings of Dave Thomas that characterize this raw, passionate music. Kinda makes you wonder what would have happened if Carl Karcher, founder of Carl's Junior, had also pursued music with such abandon and freedom from financial considerations"
1,"It sucks big time!!!!!!! Alot of this was experienced in my ears those first few months in Hell...I mean Florida. The first song I heard from this was ""Today"", and I thought it was good the first time I heard it as it was only a 30 second snipet that I heard, but then when I heard the entire song it was depressing, and then there was ""Disarm"" which I hated from day one, and the same with ""Cherub Rock"". I just felt like I shouldn't have even bought this at this particular time in my life, but I guess I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt. However, with one song barely tolerable which is ""Mayonaise"" I'm ready to dismiss this as one of the worst of the 90's"
1,"This CD is a total misrepresentation.  MANY of the songs are VERY poorly done concert versions of songs.  They even use the exact same audience cheering track on several songs.  Buy it only if you are a fan looking to fill in missing songs in your collection.  Don't buy it thinking you are getting all the original hits.  14 songs are live.  One appears to be re-recorded.  The rest are the originals.  Also, on CD #2 many of the media tags are incorrect.  When you play ""All I Really Need Is You"" (Live) the title ""Heartbreak Hotel"" shows.  When you play ""Headed for the Future"" the song title ""All I Really Need Is You"" shows.  When you play ""Heartbreak Hotel"" the song title ""Headed for the Future"" shows.  Overall, a VERY sloppy project they obviously just rushed to market not caring about quality"
2,"As a well-educated rock music,especially emo-punk,person,I was sickened every time i tried to listen to this CD all the way through.Why? It's definitely one of the less-than-great emo albums ever (not completely horrible,though)and the fact that this band is led by a singer who shouldn't be bragging about his ""musical genius"" when he should first realize how disgusting his voice sounds compared to most other emo singers,isn't sweetening the deal.When i bought this album,it had a sticker on it that read:""If you like Taking Back Sunday,Brand New and The Used,you'll love Matchbook Romance!""I should have known how desperate they were when i read that.But more disturbing is the fact that they dared compared themselves to Taking Back Sunday? TBS is actually an emo band that doesn't sound recicled.And Brand New?Have they heard Deja Entendu?That album is not only the best emo album,but definitely one of the best albums of all time-in any genre"
5,"I'm afraid Alfonso Lozada has missed the point. The film is about a span of time in the life of one person, Tony Wilson, and is thus structured around his experiences. At the same time, the film is not a documentary but a fictionalized account. On top of all this, the &quot;Tony&quot; character does mention the short shrift the Stone Roses get. Is it really a surprise to find the soundtrack album bereft of artists which did not appear in the film"
4,"For me, there have always been those bands where I like them but can only listen to a few of the songs because of the lead singers voice. This would include Maroon 5, Billy Talent, and Clap Your Hands Say Yea. While I applaud these bands for being unique, it is hard to listen to an entire cd of it. Hot Hot Heat is one of the only exceptions I have ever had. I can listen to their cd's over and over and not have to stop after the 3rd or 4th track. While anything can become irritating, it takes Hot Hot Heat quite a while to get to me. I am also not a huge fan of these new English bands like Snow Patrol and Arctic Monkeys, but yet again Hot Hot Heat has something that just sticks with me. I recommend this cd as well as Make Up The Breakdown. Very good, upbeat songs that you will enjoy full-heartedly on a car ride home"
5,This is the best R&B female album out this year. I listen to this CD all day. Although it has 10 songs like the other chick... Monica has something to say and relates to many women out there. I love this CD. My favorite is Hell No. If you have not done so go and get this immediatley especially if you wasted your money on BDay like I did
5,"Well Crossfade may just be another modern rock Alt Metal band but that doesn't make them bad. Sure, they don't really add anything new to the music out now but that shouldn't take away from the music itself. All I know is from what I heard they have some really good tracks. I first heard the track ""Cold"" on the radio and it was just one of those songs that I love instantly. I just had to go out and get the album. After getting the album It turned out to be pretty good. I pretty much enjoyed everything on here. Although, my favorite tracks would have to be ""Cold"", ""Starless"", ""Colors"", and ""Dead Skin"". Here's the track ratings...  1. Starless - 9.5/10  2. Cold - 10/10  3. So Far Away - 9.5/10  4. Colors - 10/10  5. Death Trend Setta - 10/10   6. The Deep End - 9/10 7. No Giving Up - 9.5/10 8. Dead Skin - 10/10 9. Disco - 7/10  10. The Unknown - 9/10  Overall: 93% A-  Sure, it's not really anything new but It is good and a nice listen. I enjoyed this album very much and am very curious to see what Crossfade has done with their new album that was just released. Anyway, anyone who's into this style of music will probably end up finding a bunch of other good tracks for their music collection. "
4,"Out of Exile, like the debut, rocks out of the blocks riding a rolling riff that once again confirms that these guys are actually steeped in classic hard rock folklore. Again we see Rick Rubin twiddling the knobs for a fine selection of mature hard rock. Chris Cornell is again in full possession of a voice capable of putting all sorts of feeling into his lyrics. Indeed the fact that Cornell writes all the lyrics is interesting - the fact that this band has had to work out how to operate after their still talked about former bands was another hurdle these dudes had to get over. Lucky for us that they did.  This second instalment of the Audioslave story sounds much like the first which is no bad thing. The riffs are so smooth - who let the 70's back in? - and the band show full well the way to alternate rockers with mellower stuff. This album does fell a little mellower overall. Not sure if that's why the album flopped to a certain extent in certain territories but the band have corrected the slight problem of too many tracks that affected the debut.  This ablum probably shut some of the naysayers up. Sure it's sales weren't up there with the debut but it's as consistent as the first album and it's showed that this band were a serious proposition and not just a one off project and that's a good thing as hard rock needs such gimmick free bands in the mix as a foil to some of the more hysterical bands out there. In the final analysis this is a four star release for those who like their hard rock from talented players and full off rollicking riffs for the melodies to ride along.  Token non musical gripe - why the dull/crap cover"
5,"The movie is awesome, but the cd is equally amazing.  Awe-inspiring, from quiet, peaceful music to the full orchestra in the finale at the end, this is one of the best soundtracks ever written!  A great gift to yourself or friends"
2,"I absolutely loved that song ""Carry On Wayward Son"" which sounds like one of the greatest stuff in history. Rest of the other songs on this album are not that good. 2-stars"
4,"This is a somewhat interesting exploration of language, semantics and rhythm.  It is more surreal in it's use of deconstructed conversations placed with new and different contexts.  Some of it reminds one greatly of Korean Samul-nori music, which relies mostly upon percussion and rhythm that is based upon the Korean language (listen to No. 6, ""An Animated Description of Mr. Maps"" for a very clear example of such.  While some tracks are very ingaging and suggest a different musical line of exploration from much conventional music, there is a problematic sameness in instrumentation that is sometimes very uninteresting due to a lack of musical development. The Books could end up doing very well if they were to invest more time in their musical development of their ideas and instrumentation.  Layering samples can only go so far before it is boring"
1,"Knopfler has once again fallen far short of the promise inherent in those long ago days of Dire Straits. Perhaps he is attempting to be Mr. Atkins reincarnate, but if that is the case then he should  buy the white shoes and move to Florida. Simply put, a terrible album with little to recommend it."
1,"I feel sorry for those who thought this was more great YES-Jon Anderson Christmas music.  I'm one of the few fortunate souls who actually found a 3 Ships CD after it was out of print.  Paid some $30+ for it, but worth every penny.  Too bad ripping and passing out mp3's is illegal, because I'd share!  Add my name to the ""Bring Back 3 Ships!"" petition"
5,"On What's Left of Me, Nick Lachey sings about lost love and heartbreak for they whole duration of the CD.  This is his version of No Doubt's Tragic Kingdom CD.  Every song is about a broken relationship.  The Lyrics are very good and the songs are also very well done.  Don't buy this CD if you are looking for his SoulO upbeat fluff.  The tone of this CD is sad.  Most of the songs are ballads.  But not slow ballads more like pop rock power ballads.  He has a great voice.  It is strong and has a great tone.  Out of every boy-bander I have ever heard I would say he has the most talent.  Not only is his voice strong but it is also great because he sounds like a man not a girl, (i.e. Justin Timberlake).  The stand out tracks are: I Can't Hate You Anymore, On Your Own, and Beautiful.  The rest of the songs are good too.  This CD finally makes him a legitimate music star"
2,"I recieved this CD as a present, not thinking much about it since its southern rap  This CD has almost no lyrical talent  The reason I gave it 2 stars, is because I enjoyed the production of some songs that were done by the Neptunes.  Like almost all southern rap now, its got heavy bass but no lyrical talent.  So if your one of those clueless kids that like rap (mainstream rap) I would say you could possible enjoy this cd"
1,"The show rocks, the soundtrack sucks. I didn't recognize any of the songs from the show, that alone tells you how memorable this soundtrack is. Dismal and dissapointing :"
1,"I liked the first album and I won't pretend to be an aficionado of this genre, but some things I have learned:  1) Don't rap with a touch of laryngitis 2) Maybe sing/rap with the beat and not just near it 3) Drop the ""my life sucks"" and ""everyone hates me"" tracks - whoops that is the entire album 4) I don't think the world can stand more than one rapped sad piano ballad 5) If every background singer has a better voice, perhaps your are done  Anyone want to buy a used CD"
2,"Kate Bush's second album, ""Lionheart"", may be the weakest in her catalog.  Its clear Bush did not want to fall into the trap of constructing ""The Kick Inside Part Two"", and instead reaches in a number of different directions, some successful, some less so.  Musically, the album takes stabs at ballads similar to the first record (""In Search of Peter Pan"", ""In the Warm Room""), a more pop structure (""Wow""), rhythmic shifts (""Don't Put Your Foot on the Heartbrake"") an almost shuffle (""Fullhouse"") and a gret rock song (""Hammer Horror"").  Lyrically, Bush has added a level of sensuality to her work (""Symphony in Blue"") and shows no sign of shying away from controversial subjects (""Kashka from Baghdad"").  The problem is that it doesn't hang together well to my mind-- admittedly, my rating for the album is in many ways relative to Bush's other work, no album with the absolutelyu amazing ""Kashka from Baghdad"" can be all that bad, and certainly ""Symphony in Blue"" is strong enough to stop you in your tracks, but the album just doesn't work for me.  For early Bush, try her debut (""The Kick Inside"") or the stunning ""Never For Ever"""
2,"this CD is not good.  Luckily, I only paid 5 bucks for the used copy.  I mean do we really want to hear incomplete songs?  I don't.  The couple of actual completed songs are pretty good so it gets 2 stars as opposed to the one star it probably deserves.  Bruce really took a page from Gene's book here and went after the money.  Should be an EP and nothing more"
2,"This cd just doesnt sound good which means it was poorly produced. Any 1999 cd should have better sound quality. Like the other reviewers stated,i too found it dissapointing that the wrestlers theme songs were approximately 1 minute long each.Gotta hit the repeat button to enjoy them a little longer. They could have been longer and the cd could have done without the irrelevant remarks made here and there by the commentators. Curiously too,where is the NWO's music"
1,"Painful to hear and painful to watch.  A yester-year pop singer who doesn't have the courage to quit.  There is nothing left to do so she keeps throwing out pointless album after pointless album to stay in the spotlight; if that isn't the highest form of egoism I don't know what is.  She's got fame she's got fortune she had her hits why not just go now please?  What she use to do for shock value in the early days now seems so trite and pathetic.  The woman is nothing more then a spectacle with very little substance.  She uses anything from sex to religion to self promote.  Yes I was a fan in the days of Like a prayer and Vogue but I have moved on, why Madonna doesn't come to the same conclusion I will never understand.  This CD is good for the flavor of the month but its shelf life is way past due.  I challenge Madonna to put on a concert without all the antics and overt sexual malarkey that dominates her shows; she would be booed right off the stage if that were to happen.  And please enough with the crucifixion stunts all ready.  "
4,This album is what the goo is all about.......they were at their BEST here!!!!!!!!!!  This was the classic album they will never ever be able to pruduce again
1,"Nelly's sophomore album was just as bad as his first one. The song Hot In Herre was a decent lead off single, so I thought that he might have came to his senses a little bit. Boy was I wrong. More singing and this time with Kelly Rowland from Destiny's Child on the song Delimma and a song with Justin Timberlake. Now he makes a somewhat attempt to impress me by taking Beanie Siegel's Roc Tha Mic (Remix) and puts it on his CD, not to mention taking a shot a hip hop legend KRS-One. Another track worth listening to is #1 and possibly the only song that he has made by himself worth listening to. Everything else, just a big no no. Once again he has appealed himself to the people who hardly listening to rap, because I even hear that song with Kelly Rowland on oldies radio stations. This right here has got to stop, because I had enough of it."
5,"Bob is the King!  The KING!  Get this disc, you will dig it.  You can really sense the urgency in this CD.  Go to Bob's site, check out some of his notes on the Album.  If you can make to Austin, TX, spend about 2 weeks going to Bob's shows and you will understand.  From Joe Rockhead to Texas Bluegrass Masacre, Bob's the real deal, always pushing boundries, coming up with new sounds, un-corporate, straight ahead Rock and Roll"
5,"I'm trying to get everything he ever did, a real her"
5,Don''t waste anymore time in reading reviews.  Go and get this album
1,"I'm not the biggest fan of Springsteen, but I have liked a lot of what he's done in the past. I wasted my money on this one. It sounds like uninspired mumbling. Not much musical or vocal variation at all among the songs. Nothing stands out. No experimentation. There might be some good story lines in the songs, but I usually can't understand him anyway. I liked two songs, but not enough to get the album out and turn it on. I never desire to play it after a few listenings. So beware, unless your a huge fan and want all his music, this one may let you down."
1,"bought this cd quite a while ago. it is probably very good, but how can i tell when it won't play on my stereo? this dual disc format is the music industries way of screwing long time fans. this sticking it to the fan is about as low as it gets. after buying the disc, i noticed the tiny warning on the back that says ""audio side of disc does not conform to cd specifications and therefor not all cd players will play the audio side of this disc."" WHAT A GREAT IDEA: SELL A DISC TO PEOPLE THAT WON'T PLAY FOR EVERYBODY. THANKS A..HOLES"
5,"I AM A TRUE SMOOTH JAZZ FAN AND I HAVE TO SAY THIS IS THE BEST CD BRIAN HAS EVER MADE."" COME ON UP "" IS GOOD BUT ""NICE AND SLOW"" IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS.LISTEN ONE TIME AND YOU WILL BE HOOKED I KNOW I WAS.                                   "
5,Nicholas Reyes has the absolutely perfect voice for this music...a fantastic collection of energetic rhythms to  keep you moving!!  
1,For a group that exudes such passion in their music (LIVE FROM BUFFALO anybody?) this song is like a funeral dirge. I can only hope that they haven't released the full album because they are trying to rekindle the passion that has made them the fan-favorite that they are.  Take your time guys - let's get your BEST work.   T
5,"I rated this album 5 stars because it wouldn't let me do a 4.9 star. 3:16 was the perfect LP. This is very close. There is no one song that stands out like there was on 3:16 with, Walk Like A Man, but still, the cd is one of the best yet.  Let me say this, I have 3 Murs CDs, The end of the beginning, 3:16, and now Murray's Revenge. This is the second best of the 3. Track 6, Dreamchaser, is definately worth putting on repeat all day. That is my favorite song on the cd.  All of the tracks on here are solid.   For someone trying to get a feel for Murs and his style, he uses a lot of samples in his beats like Kanye West, and his flow, well, hes in a league of his own. One of the best lyricists out there today and maybe of all time. He is not underground, but not big yet either. He deserves air time. His tracks aren't aimed for that like say, a Nelly or Little Jon.  All I can say is, Murs deserves to be one of the TOP emcees in the business. And in my opinion, he is, by far. It would be interesting to see a colaboration between Murs and say, Mos Def or The Roots.  All in all, BUY THIS CD"
5,"Bow Wow Wow is not a Household Name, They Charted Once in the USA with ""I want Candy"" (Top 50), and released only 3 Proper Albums...Their Sound is Tribal, the Lead Singer Annabella often Yelps to Percussive Drumming and throbbing Bass, The Mixture yields Many Great Tunes, but it can take getting used to, as it did for Me, I was not a Fan untill much listening...If You don't know a lot of the Group's Songs, I suggest listening to as many 30 second Samples as possible to get a feeling of whether this stuff is digestible...Most of the Songs here are first-rate, I particularly Love ""TV Savage"", ""Golly Golly Go Buddy!"" and ""Louis Qatorze"", along with Annabella's Solo Turn ""Fever""....If You want to explore further, I suggest the CD ""Girl Bites Dog: Your Compact Disc Pet"" to round out Your Collection, it includes more Gems, such as ""Sexy Effiel Tower"" (Where 14 Year-Old Annabella Pants Orgasmically...and more authentically than Donna Summer)and ""Radio G String"", as well as 3 Cuts from this CD in different versions; But begin here, and don't go further unless You Adore this CD...."
5,"One of my top fave Rasputina albums. Tons of great songs, very few joke songs, and great art work"
5,"I've been listening to Chris Cornell for about two years, after discovering him in Audioslave. Then I heard ""Black Hole Sun"" and ""Spoonman"" and after that more or less forgot about Soundgarden. My friend lent me this CD one day and I forgot about it for a month or two and finally listened to it yesterday and well...Wow. First off, Chris Cornell has one of the strongest, most recognizable voices in rock and he has such range it's amazing. These songs are all hard, raw, catchy, and all have a great guitar & drum sound. ""Outshined"" is probably my favorite Soundgarden song of all time. No rock fan should pass this up:  1. Rusty Cage-5/5-One of my favorite Soundgarden songs. It's fu**ing great; Chris Cornell hits some great notes too. 2. Outshined-5/5-Fu**ing killer! The chorus is catchy as hell. 3. Slaves & Bulldozers-5/5-Chris Cornell has an awesome screaming voice. This song has some good lyrics, guitar solo is good, and Matt Cameron's drumming stands out. 4. Jesus Christ Pose-5/5-I don't know what this song is about, but it kicks  a$$. The music (guitar & drumming anyway) is really good. 5. Face Pollution-5/5-Great title, the song is OK. The shortest song on the album. I know I'm probably hallucinating but it sounds like Maynard James Keenan (lead singer of Tool) is singing gibberish at the end. 6. Somewhere-5/5-The most harmonious song on the album, but there's still some ""screamage"". 7. Searching With My Good Eye Closed-5/5-The opening of the song with a man naming animals and what they say and finally stating ""The devil sounds like this"" and then Cornell begins singing is great. Really good lyrics too. 8. Room a Thousand Years Wide-4/5-The music is good, but the vocals are kind of overshadowed by the music;  hence 4/5 9. Mind Riot-5/5-Easily has the least amount of screaming of any of the songs. Cornell sings the song perfectly. 10. Drawing Flies-5/5-Lyrics are good. 11. Holy Water-5/5-(No Comment) 12. New Damage-5/5-One of the best on the album. The album goes out with a bang!  "
5,"I have to say my fav songs are when Amy Lee sits down at the piano and isn't up running around, she sounds *wonderful*. "
4,"I first listened to this CD on my work sound system which does not do it justice.  I was only mildly impressed and was preparing to submit a scathing review with the main focus being ""mediocrity at its best.""  But then I took it home and put it on a real sound system. VOILA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  While I still contend that Gerald is infinitely more viable as a premiere session man than a solo artist, this second outing with GRP is far superior to ""Groovology;""  the former project seemed to be a classic example of an artist suffering from musician's block. ""Kickin' It"" is the exact opposite - with help from the likes of Jeff Lorber and George Duke, it appears creativity was at an all-time high with the end result being a wonderful project that you will enjoy over and over again.  The arrangements are tight with fresh interpretations, a nice ode to Jr. Walker and some oh so nice tunes in collaboration with Lorber.  Quite honestly, I haven't been this impressed with a Gerald Albright project in quite a whie.  It appears he is finally hittinhg his stride and I could not be more pleased.  Niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice, Gerald!!!"
4,"Originally released in 1993, Dark Tranquility's Skydancer remains a masterpiece.  Along with At the Gates, In Flames, Carcass, Death and Edge of Sanity, Dark Tranquility created the genre known as melodic death metal. Everything expected of a good melodic death album is here. Aggresive sounds juxtaposed with acoustic parts, an inteligent concept and growled vocals.  Mikeal Stanne is one of the only vocalists who can sound pissed off and peaceful all at the same time.  Many of the ideas such as using female vocals for different effects were way ahead of their time as well. Can't give a perfect rating though because while it's original, the production isn't very well done and they hadn't quite hit the peak of their skills yet"
2,"I was not pleased with the quality of this recording.  The McGarrigles are just wonderful, but the sound engineering of the album is a disaster.  The first and last cuts seem OK, but the ones in between are overridden so badly by the heavy-handed instruments that it all just seem noisy!  The piano in particular was so loud that the songs were unintelligible.  I also didn't appreciate the sisters' reworking of several songs I already love from ""The Bells of Dublin"" (some of the best Christmas music ever recorded).  The sparkle I longed for just isn't there in this one"
5,"Sleater-Kinney's Dig Me Out is not only one of the finest records of the 1990's, it's a pivotal cross-section of 90's music - spitfire women striking independence on one end, vulnerable earthy types pow-wowing on the other.  It may be a masterful sonic assault of punk fury, but it's punk fury mixed with intimacy and fragility.  When Corin Tucker wails in the title track to dig her, ""out of my body, out of my skin,"" you feel wounded alright, but it's in the humanity of such a line and the honesty of its production.  The songs don't let down from there - the sad love-triangle crackdown of ""One More Hour,"" the fury of ""Words and Guitar,"" the sexiness of ""Dance Song '97.""  This is the moment that a very good band became a great one with the capacity to topple over rock's foundation by aiming for its heart"
5,"hes great to listen to, his songs are really good and are easy to sing along to especially manifesto # 1 is my fave"
4,"While Steely Dan has received the compilation treatment on more than one occassion, the latest ""Definitive Collection"" brings some of the band's best known work onto a single disc. Also, for completeness, one track each from their 'reunion' CDs are included here. Steely classics such as ""Do It Again"", ""Reelin' In The Years"", ""Rikki Don't Lose That Number"", ""Black Friday"", ""Deacon Blues"", ""Peg"" and ""Hey Nineteen"" are all included here and sound just as fresh and unique as they did back in the day. While this collection is an ideal place to start for the beginning Dan fan because of its songs and low price, it should be noted that there is one glaring omission to this Definitive Collection - the all-time classic ""Josie"". Granted, this CD is already packed to its limits with close to 78-minutes of music and is excellent from start to finish. However, including ""Josie"" and dropping a track like, say ""Dirty Work"" (writer's opinion) would have made this collection a lot stronger and cohesive overall. I guess this is how the band wanted it because they were indeed involved with the compilation of this collection.  Apart from this, Steely Dan's ""Definitive Collection"" is a great introduction to the band. For a more comprehensive overview, check out the double-disc compilation ""Show Biz Kids"" which includes all of the tracks included here (minus the two 'reunion' tracks) plus many many more."
5,"If you've ever liked the T-Bone Walker style, or drooled over the pure T-Bone licks that both Ronnie and Duke have graced us with over the years, ""Two Bones and a Pick"" is eight minutes of pure jump-blues-guitar-heaven.  I can, and do listen to this for hours on end.  If any two white guys have got that jump-blues-guitar-thang down, it's these two.  T-Bone is grinning like a Cheshire cat"
4,First off; I really appreciate artists or labels that give you at least 60 minutes of play time and don't cut out lengthy guitar solos.  This CD certainly delivers in this regard as Ronnie Earl and the Duke trade guitar jams in creative duets for a solid 70 plus minutes.  This is a close 5 star recommendation but it isn't a classic and it isn't groundbreaking; although I would think some reviewers would seriously disagree with that point.  It's just damn good music by two pros whose different styles compliment one another.  Highly recommended.
4,"The first time I heard Cannibal Ox was last winter in my friends snowboard video. He did the intro over the first and in my opinion BEST track on the CD Iron Galaxy. Basically that got me interested in the group and I later found out that they were correlated with one of my favorite groups ever Company Flow.  I copped their CD, but waited a really long time to listen to it. It's pretty futuristic, kind of abstract like Deltron 3030 (another one of my favs), while the lyrical content is nowhere near Deltron (hell, what is?) it is very good. I mean obviously you should expect to hear a LOT of Co-Flow when you listen to this, so if you're not a fan it might not be the best idea to pick this one up. The CD has some very good songs A B-Boys Alpha, Atom, and another one of my favorites, The Battle For Asgard. However I think some songs on here tanked the whole album. For one- a couple of the tracks on the CD are weakly produced, Stress Rap & Painkillers. And a couple tracks seems like they just sorted started thinking of words that rhymed in the studio and went with that, Vein & Real Earth.  Basically this CD is 80% genius, so 4 stars is what it gets-and to be honest I'd like to just give it 3.5 because I feel they coulda done a lot better"
1,"Nelly is one of the most annoying ignorant rappers I have ever heard. I do give him props on his first album, but he went downhill and started that whole ""I can make great club beats, but write bubblegum lyrics over it"" trend. This sadly created all the Chingys, Lil Johns and so on. The guy doesn't add any substance to his music, yet he sells millions thanks to MTV. Just save your money on real artist that makes real music"
1,"THE CARS HAVE TO BE ONE OF THE MOST OVERRATED BANDS OF ALL TIME. THEY HAVE ONLY MADE 1 DECENT SONG IN BYE BYE LOVE. REST OF THEIR SONGS JUST PLAIN SUCK. I MEAN WHY DO PEOPLE LOVE LOUSY BANDS IN QUEEN, CARS, ACDC, BEATLES, STONES, WHO, STEVE MILLER, AND BOSTON? GOOD BANDS ARE REQUIRED TO BE DIRE STRAITS, FOREIGNER, GUNS N' ROSES, NIRVANA, GREEN DAY, AEROSMITH, AND JOE WALSH. DON'T READ THE 5 STAR REVIEWERS FOR THIS TERRIBLE COMPILATION. GO GET A BETTER ALBUM FROM NIRVANA INSTED. PS THE CARS SUCK"
2,"paul what were you thinking? you do so good on mixtapes lyricly and on get ya mind correct but on this no effort! ok first im a playa taken from still tippin, internet goiong nutz from still tippin all with corny flows repeatative terms but some songs were good sittin sideways was already rammed into my head like a year before it came out so what does that leave you with? surp sippin bugz bunny? what? chick magnet or how to be a player should have been re released instead of this cd! big ballin was pretty good but still the cd is just not worth listenen to buy the paul wall mixtape its got all the good songs and more the mixtape is way better trust me! he needs some new flows! fo real! oh yeah this tracklist aint right atleast with the cd i got."
1,"Wack rhymes make me puke via my ear canal. That's how wack Paul Wall is. After I have eaten a full meal and listened to Paul wall, My dinner is regurgitated through my ears. I am sooooooooooo tired of these garbage rappers polluting the airwaves with garbage. This guy wouldn't know lyrical content if I slapped him with a Mos Def CD"
2,"Kim Waters is one of the nicest persons one could meet, but that still does not prevent me from giving a brutally frank review that will hopefully help him in the future. While I could tell that considerable time was put in this project, that drum machine killed this effort. The music here is so mechanical and irritating from that drum machine, I just can't stand to listen to it. The drum machine cheapens the sound so much that I cannot recommend this CD to real music lovers especially those with decent audio systems. The only composition that sounds like real music is ""Daydreaming"", but this too is somewhat marred by that mechanical drum machine although less than the others. Kim, please use real drums from now on. You are a seasoned smooth jazz artist with great talent, but you cheapen your production relying on a drum machine. That machine sounds mechanical with no spontaneity. You are too advance as an artist to have to rely on it. It may cost a little more for a real drummer, but you are in a class where real drums are indispensible"
5,"This is an excellent CD.  It is fun to dance to, sing to, and drive to.  It doesn't matter if you like country music or not-you can enjoy Keith Urban's music.  Even better than his CD's are his live shows.  Well worth the ticket price and one of the best concerts you will see. "
5,"Well, I have to confess that I had never heard of Chris until I was taken to a concert back in 2004. Of all the bands that played that night, I have to admit Chris really reached me.  This CD has a good balance between worshipful songs and ones that rock. Chris' lead guitarist often sounds somewhat similar to U2's 'the Edge' especially on 'Forever' which really adds a great dimension to the song.  I had never fully appreciated worship songs until I heard Chris do 'How Great is Our God' which gave me a whole new perspective and is very effectively captured on this CD.  Besides those tunes, the CD becomes a must-buy with the inclusion of a superb energetic version of 'Indescribable' and other popular songs such as 'Famous One' & 'Raise Up Holy Hands.'  I had been hoping since that concert that he would release a CD from that tour, and my hope has now been answered (imagine that).   2/06 update: eight of us just saw Chris again in Saginaw, MI and days later we all agreed that it was one of the best worship experiences of our lives.  It's certainly difficult for a CD to fully match the experience of being there, but with the right perspective, it can get you pretty close.  Be sure to try and see Chris on his current tour w/Matt Redman & speaker Louie Giglio"
5,"I have to admit, it took me awhile to actually enjoy Relient K. I used to think their music was very generic and their lyrics were cheesy. But this album changed everything for me. Matt Thiessen is such a clever lyricist, using enough word plays to delight the wordsmith in me, but also making me think more deeply about my relationship with God and others.  The band sticks to their standard pop-punk riffs on this album, though I believe they use smoother speed and instrumental transitions on this album. Example: Be My Escape starts with screaming guitars and a fast beat, softens down to keyboards, vocals and light drumming during the verses, back up to rocking during the bridge and chorus, and slows right down for a touching finish. There are several other songs that vary in a like manner.  Lyrically, I really enjoyed Be My Escape (but the beauty of grace is that it makes life not fair), Which to Bury, Us or the Hatchet (I move you, but you just wouldn't budge, I tried to hold your hand but you'd rather hold your grudge), When I Go Down (When I go down, I'll lift my eyes to You, but I won't look too far, 'Cause You'll be there with open arms, to lift me up again...). What a beautiful way to end the album!  Musically, many songs stand out - High of 75 is probably the most original song, starting with acoustic guitar, and including a drum loop in the chorus. Other highlights include Who I am Hates Who I've Been, and Life After Death & Taxes, which combines great vocals with some cool screaming!  Relient K has made a fan out of me, and if you buy this album, it will do the same for you"
1,"I have seen these guys twice, once opening for six feet under, and the other for strapping young lad. And god almighty both times i wanted to bash my head in concrete to keep from hearing these guys. Overall these guys suck even the heavy parts and the melodic parts will put you to sleep. Stop trying to be unearth and opeth and make good music like they do.."
2,"If you've listened to Alison Krauss, you've heard the best.  Rhonda's arrangements and voice were adequate, but nothing special, and I doubt I'll listen to the CD again. "
1,"This musician, if you can call him that, should be embarrassed.  If he has something to say, more people would listen if he didn't use such vulgar language and stopped talking about his body parts.  I won't be buying this and my kids won't either.  Repulsive"
2,"In the past few months, I have gotten super into all of Devendra's other works, and was excited for another little delicious surprise like the others when I first picked this album up.  Oh, what a dissapointment I was in for.  The album does not carry through it's energy as many of Banhart's other albums do so well.  Also, having already heard many other versions of the same songs that are on here on his split album with Jana Hunter, I found these to be much more dull, and did not carry forward their emotion in the way that the other recordings do.  That being said, Devendra is always quite alright, if not wonderful.  I find his voice to be entirely charming, and he is generally a very talented song writer.    So, the moral?  If you couldn't really get into this recording, please don't give up on Devendra yet.  I highly recommend ""Cripple Crow"", his split album with Jana Hunter, and, if you are into music that is slightly more raw, ""The Black Babies"", which is my personal favorite"
5,"I had the opportunity to see Tom Braxton play for an extremely happy crowd at his almamader, Dunbar Middle School (then Dunbar High School). ""Julian's Smile"" and ""Bounce"" are superbly played, smoothe and fresh sound. See him live if you get the chance, buy the CD anyway"
1,"Drew's Famous Party Music is a joke. I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased this cd. In the past 3 weeks, I have probably ordered 8 or 9 compilation cd's looking for great music from the 70s, 80s and 90's for a party I am hosting. I read the reviews for the other cd's and they were great, but in my excitement about finding Whoomp there it is and Love Train, I didn't check the reviews for this cd. This CD is not at all what I thought it would be. Trust me, THIS IS NOT THE ONE, it's not even on the list. I was looking for Whoomp there it is, and especially Love Train by the Ojays. Not what I got. I excitedly listened to Whoomp, and I kept saying this doesn't sound right. Something sounds like its missing from the song. So I listened to Love Train, and immediately, I knew that it was not the Ojays singing. I realized that none of the original artists were singing. This is a terrible misrepresentation. I was so disappointed! Thank goodness I listened to the cd before I played it at the party. I would have been horrified. I wish I could give it less than one star and get a refund. Please, please, please DON'T waste your money"
5,"This album further compliments the astonishing work the artist has done along with the spectacular singing of The Love Fellowship Choir! I must say when I hear the work of this ensemble I am all ears because I'm never disappointed in knowing they will always ""Bring it"" !!  God Bless!!"
5,"TERMINAL HEAVEN'S ROCK IS A GREAT SONG! Sick Vibration and OVER AMP are pretty good too. OVER AMP has usual weird english lyrics. ""She lives by fake slide away"".  I highly recomend you get this. It's 12 minutes, 8 seconds a pure good songs. You will listen to them at least three times each time you pop it into your CD player"
5,"I like every song.  Unlike many other bands, this CD is just as good as their previous CD"
2,"all of the songs on this album are very good, however it doesn't live up to standards. sublimes a much better band than this album shows. if your a casual fan, i would not recomoned this to start. instead, i'd recomend ""40 oz. to Freedom"" thats my personal favorite Sublime album. it may not have all the hits on it, but is much better than robbin the hood and self-titled. great songs, terrible compilatio"
2,"When I listened to this CD I actually expected to hear Gloria Estafan singing on some of these songs.  Some of them seem like they were written for her.  Wild Card has a few good songs on it.  The title track is okay.  Moonlight and King Of Hearts are better.  The last good CD by the Rippington's was Weekend In Monaco.  Changes in personnel, locations, and labels haven't proved to be too good for Russ's music.  He's made his money and can experiment with various ideas.  Wild Card is loser in my opinion, but at least it's better than Brave New World"
5,"This album was released three years after the New Pornographers awesome debut album. This album is similar, but has a more glossy feel than the previous album. The album is definately more polished. Great synths and percussion throughout the album. Electric Version is an enjoyable and easy listen, chock-full of hungry hooks and brimming with indie rock's classic humility"
5,"Guns N'Roses are one of my all time favorite bands, so this album is a little disappointing, don't get me wrong, nearly every song on here is great there are just other songs that are more deserving. It just so happens though that record labels never get greatest hits album right, just look at Led Zeppelin's Greatist hits. The only reason the record label released this anyways was because Axl was taking way to long for Chinese Domocracy and they wanted some money, so they put this out, and it has gathered a good deal of money. This Album does do a good job of confirming what all real rock fans already know, that Guns N' Roses are one of the biggest and best rock bands of all time. They came at a time when rock and roll needed a savior, and they did just that, they brought some soul and attitude back in to the music. Songs like november rain, welcome to the jungle, and paradise city really highlight the bands strong points, thus making this album a good starting point for a new fan. I would reccomend buying all their albums though, because all of them are genius, except for the spaghetti incident, which was just a cover album anyways.  This album did fail to include classic cuts like Mr.Brownstone, It Ain't easy, Nighttrain, Rocket Queen, and others and for that I am angry. Also, how on earth did the sympathy for the devil cover get on here, it is simply terrible, possibly the worst Guns N' Roses song ever. So, if you are already a huge fan and have all the albums, don't get this, save your money for chinese democracy it is going to come, there have been rumors of a release before the year's end. I have heard live versions of songs from the album and they are incredible, cuts like madagascar, the blues, Rhiad and the Bedouins reaffirmed my belief in Axl, and I think if this album ever hits the light of day it will be huge. Also check out a band called Rose hill Drive, they are the most exciting band out today and any true fan of rock and roll should enjoy them."
5,A great white noise kind of CD.  Just plain rain.  Well I must admit it sounds a wee bit like frying bacon to me.  Whatever.  My babies both nap really well to it.  I recommend it to my mommy friends.  It's been a must at our house
2,"This record is not Robben Ford at his best, uninspired playing and singing and the lyrics are really at a low level, not a good record at all."
4,"This CD is just okay. The early JB ballads are the thing here. Gives you a good idea of a good chitlin' circuit performance as typically done for Black audiecnes in those days with approrpiate audience response. The standouts here include the extended version of &quot;Lost Someone&quot; which leads into &quot;Please Please Please.&quot; Even without being able to see the infamous cape routine, it's quite entertaining. But overall, Vol. 2 is better since that CD plays up the more uptempo stuff that put JB on the map"
5,"Ok, so KS has a similar voice to Conor Oberst. So what? What's the big deal? Blink-182, Good Charlotte, and Simple Plan all sound exactly the same, and they're getting five star reviews! Just lay off of it. And, even though their voices are similar, their music is much different, they sound different. They even use orchestras and accordions and brass and woodwinds and... well, that's it. But this is not your ordinary rip off folk/indie band. And, maybe his voice naturally sounds like Conor Oberst's. You can't help that. An Angle are very talented and experiment with different sounds. I pop this CD in from time to time, not my favorite, but it's very good! So, just give this a chance without thinking it as a Bright Eyes rip-off, because that's just what it's not"
5,"I came to beastie boys on the back of vague recommendations from a mate, not knowing what to expect. Initially, i got licensed to ill, which i enjoyed for what it is, but it was not the stuff i had been recommended. I moved to check your head, and was pleasantly surprised at songs like pass the mic, so what'cha want, live at pjs. Since then, I have been ABSOLUTELY blown away by this album. There is no other album i know of that combines punk-rock, metal, acid jazz, funk, world beats, and hip-hop, in the same album, sometimes even in the same song. And it makes for a great mix.  Not only is this album a great mix of styles, but it is produced crisply, with the vocals mixed down slightly to become an accompaniment to the rest of the instruments, synths blending seamlessly in and out of the music, and the tribal beats laying the foundation for some great songs. The beasties manage to record and mix accordingly for the style of each song style they attempt.  And they attempt a lot. Songs like 'The Update', 'Futterman's Rule' are a psychedelic funk-fest, with tribal world beats as a backbone,synths everywhere and funky guitar licks, i cant help but love them. Songs like 'Sabotage' and 'Heart Attack Man' make for a change of pace, with great punk metal riffs, and fast heavy drum beats. My personal favourite simply for its ingenuity and awesome sound is flute loop; who else but the Beasties could take a folk sounding flute riff, and bring it into the hip-hop world with funky beats, mad scratches and mad lyrics? No one, thats who.  Ultimately, there is something here for a fan of every type of music.I recommend this album to anyone who loves funk, punk, hip-hop, or jazz.  My recommendations are: The Update, Futterman's Rule, Flute Loop, Sure Shot, Heart Attack Man, B-Boys making with the Freak Freak.  Enjoy"
5,"I'm ashamed to say that, even as an adult, I love the music on this CD! The kids listen to it in the car and on their little CD player. They are older (8 and 11), so they already knew the lower times tables, but all the songs are great so we listen to them anyway and now they can remember all the numbers. (They go up to 13.)  It's a long CD - definately longer than other kids music - but it has a story to it that follows along with the songs. It's like listening to a book on tape. After years of Barney and SpongeBob (neither did much for my kids' brains), I'm so glad to have something that *I* can sing along with too"
5,"I had forgotten over the years just how wonderful this album was, so I was thrilled to find it here at Amazon! Granted, it's not the heavy black vinyl with the faded dog earred cover, but this one fits in my car stereo, makes the commute miles fly by and sounds even better then it did long ago! Thanks"
1,"Troy why did you put your name on this.  This cd has one good song on it and that is about the long and short of it.  I am not going to waste a bunch of time talking about a cd that is not worthy of being pressed, by the way the group was better with Conrad the Colonel (Ehhhh Hehhh!  I AM DSGB!"
5,"OutKast had been out for a minute but this album made me become a true fan and recognize their creativity.  This album is crunk, it's exciting, it's brilliantly put together and a fine example of hip hop at its best.  OutKast is pioneering and yet so fantastic they're almost mainstream now -- but in a good way (OutKast is the anti-Black Eyed Peas, LOL).  Stankonia just continues OutKast's everchanging shape that keeps taking hip hop to higher levels.  If you've listened to Southernplayalisticadilacmuzik, ATLiens and Aquemini, you probably know to expect the unexpected on this album.  Stankonia is one of the hip hop albums I always throw up in debates as proof that good hip hop can still simultaneously make you dance/groove and think at the same time.  That Andre 3000 is deceptively very, very political, but you gotta pay attention or you'll miss his messages.  Highly recommended LP. Fun and crunk with hidden social/political commentary. One of my all-time favorite albums"
1,"This type of music is like a blister on the brain.  You can't get rid of it and it is irritating.  Yes, this is the problem with most FM radio when this CD from 4 years ago is still getting played.  And the tune to ""This Love"" is beyond annoying as he pauses between each word.  Moron 5 rank up there with Gwen Stefani and Black Eyes Peas for most annoying, successful artists"
1,"Nine inch nails are the only band on this cd worth listening to, this sound track is crap"
1,"Before you dismiss me as a stupid hater, hear me out. I personally think Omarion is a reasonably good singer & one helluva great dancer, but I swear to God that this is one of the worst albums I've ever heard.   This album is entirely deprived of emotional depth & there's not a shred of originality in sight or -more importantly- in sound. You've got love, sex & below-average club bangers, but nothing beyond that! If there's anything that annoys me more than the fact that I bothered taking the time to listen to this near-worthless junk, it's knowing that Omarion's fans & groupies were insane enough to blow their hard-earned cash & propel this album into the #1 spot on the Billboard Album Top 200! That says alot about musical standards nowadays.  However, there are some bright spots on the album that show hints of true potential in Omarion. ""I Wish"" is a beautiful slow jam about wishing he never fell in love with his certain girl, while Omarion's hit single, titled ""O"", will have any girl melting slowly as they listen to his smooth vocals, regardless of unoriginal subject matter. ""Touch"" is also another highlight, combining catchy, simplistic, danceable beats with smooth vocals & unoriginal subject matter (in this case, lust & sex). Then again, most club bangers don't need much substance, so it's no big deal in this case. I personally think this track deserved more success. Oh yeah, better not forget ""Growing Pains"", a touching song that explains Omarion's break-up with former hit R&B/Pop group B2K!  However, 3 great tracks & 1 above-avergae track (Touch) are not enough to save this album from falling apart. The rest of of this album is utter garbage (to put it lightly), and anyone with at least 1/2 a brain will realize how tragic this album really is. Omarion needs to put more thought & substance into his music before anybody truly begins to take him seriously! I hope Omarion improves if he decides to make a 2nd solo album, but until then, definitely skip this!!   NB: In case anybody's wondering why I bothered to review an album I consider to be so bad, it's because I feel that nobody, and I mean NOBODY, should be wasting their hard-earned cash on such ridicious, mentally corruptive Bubblegum cr*p like this. Not only that, but Omarion doesn't deserve the success his album got. There's obviously many more artists out there who are more deserving of success than Omarion in terms of a solo career"
5,"Time Without Consequence is one of those albums. One of the ones that you can put into your cd player and just feel completely enveloped by the music. The quiet, gentle intensity of this album is just outstanding. Murdoch seems to be singing/playing so effortlessly and at the same time pouring his entire soul into the music. It is a dichotomy that is present throughout the entire album and it works extremely well.   The comparisons between Murdoch and Nick Drake are valid, and that is actually the first time I've said that, which is amazing considering how many artists people compare to Nick Drake. The biggest similarity between the two is the quiet intensity they bring to their music. But Murdoch goes beyond Nick Drake in the sense that he is not just a Drake clone, and his songs showcase Murdoch's own identity and direction.   I won't go into individual songs, because I'm sure others will review the album song by song. I'll just say that I although I have my favorites, there aren't any bad songs on this album. All the songs are quality pieces of music and none deserve to be skipped over. This will probably be the top album of the year for me, and it is definitely the best I've heard so far. Great music."
5,"This album is Sting's prophetic masterpiece, a brilliant work of rocknroll genius with a soul, a conscience, and some of the most powerful, beautiful songs written. In this ablum Sting addresses crucial political issues of our time, and timeless subjects like love, redemption, war, and more, in poetry that ranks with the very best. Like others, I loved Dream of the Blue Turtles and Nothing Like the Sun, but Sacred Love truly surpasses them in its depth, maturity, passion, varied range and lyrical beauty. This is as good as rock gets, and it rarely gets close to this good. That said, ""Sacred Love"" may make some people uncomfortable due to the issues Sting takes on here, and to the new territory he is exploring through his art. And it may go over the heads of those who don't want rock and roll to challenge them, musically, politically or spiritually. Thank God for artists like Sting who follow their muse with unwavering integrity and let the chips fall where they may"
1,"The power of marketing behind Mrs. Souza is incredible! Her previous album, Brazilian Duos, was listed among the Best Jazz Albums of 2001 by New York Times - a critic, Mr. Ben Ratliff, had received an advance CD copy and included the album on his list, although the album only would be officially released in April 2002...Strange? Well, the next year the same Mr. Ratliff, in the same NY Times, included the same CD in his Best Jazz Albums of 2002 list...Then, &quot;Brazilian Duos&quot; got a Grammy nomination in March 2003...And now, in a few days, this horrible &quot;North and South&quot; CD will receive a Grammy nomination for Best Jazz Vocal Album...No more comments"
5,"There is not much to say about this album that has not been said already.  It was the first of many albums that solidified the jump of the british psychadelic band pink floyd into the worldwide limelight, unsurpassed Jagernaut that it became.  It has a very timeless sound, and flows effortlessly from one song to another and just takes you through an unsurpassed journey from beginning to end.  Time, Money, Us and Them, and Brain Damage are my amongt my top 20 floyd songs of all time.  If you need to own one floyd album, it should be this album.  Pallatable to all old fans, and to new ones. "
4,this is a well done soundtrack...my only complaint about it is that the violin parts can get a bit tedious...but I guess they are really good because I didn't  even notice them when I saw the movie...so...overall...very good! ...also a very creepy them
5,"Fleetwood Mac in the 70's and early 80's were the biggest band on the planet. With a new line-up that included Stevie Nicks and Lindsay Buckingham they owned the music world. Rumors is still on the top 5 best sellers of all-time. This compilation includes all their hits and some rare gems as well. Silver Springs was recorded during the Rumors sessions. Stevie Nicks asked if she could use the song for a solo album. Mick Fleetwood did not allow her to use the song. It was later recorded for the Dance and became a major hit for them in the 90's The version you hear on this compilation is the one recorded for Rumors in the 70's Its almost frightening that a song this good was not included on Rumors. Fleetwood Mac continues to tour and record and still makes great music. This is for the serious Fleetwood Mac fan who wants to hear rare gems, and cant not get enough of their classic songs"
5,"Oh my goodness....I had this on a vinyl LP back when I was a very young teenager and nearly drove my parents CRAZY with it. I listened to it 3 times a day for about two years....about 700 times or more...when I was 14 and 15.  Now that I listen to it again, I see it was terribly formative for me, a major influence on my life.  I never realized how much the lyrics interweave through my psyche even now, miles away, years later....Buy this and it will change your life"
4,just wanted to say my mom liked this album so he has changed tremendiously. thats al
1,"A terrible, terrible waste of money. All this CD serves in doing is to illustrate what a knuckle-head Paul Godfrey is. Face it: no one gives a sh@t about Morcheeba anymore, we're not interested in who 'inspired' them, (poor Annette Peacock - has anyone told her?). The next time we see Paul Godfrey he'll probably be asking that age-old question: &quot;paper or plastic?&quot"
5,"As a completist Gram fan since 1969, the alternate versions of We'll Sweep Out the Ashes, Streets of Baltimore, and Hickory Wind are truly otherworldly.  Well worth the price, in and of themselves"
5,"I was too young to be in love at that time but I remember jamming to "" No More Lies"" on the radio. In fact, I enjoy the whole album, and listen to them all except ""If"" and ""Special Thanks"" - her squeaky voice cracks me up"
1,"This guy is a pop music clown who ruins careers. OLP have no business working with him and the result shows. OLP is way out of Ballards league and I have no idea why they would limit themselves to his naive view of pop music. Perhaps OLP wanted to have a sell-out sound, otherwise this disc is a disaster. Somewhere out there is pure disposable pop. None of this material would be on ""Happiness"" or ""Spiritual Machines"" How can you go from a concept album from a Ray Kurzveil book to a horrible Glen Ballard. over produced, pop record"
5,"Michael Giacchino's score for Mission: Impossible 3 is an excellent blend of action music and a grat adaption of Schiffen's classic music.  As he did with the Incredibles, Giacchino shows the ability to write a classic score that fits perfectly with the film and stands up well on its own.  Probably the best of the three Mission scores.  Elfman's matched his own style, Zimmer's matched his, but Giacchino's matched Mission:Impossibles"
5,"From the pop title track, a duet with Kid rock protege Uncle Kracker,to the heartstring tug of There goes my life, this album has great range and thoughtful lyrics which are absent in many other genres. Chesney is perfectly positioned to become a crossover star, earning the status  more from his music than his pretty boy image. Aside from the title track, most songs refreshingly veer from his beachcombing, young jimmy Buffet beach anthems that are characteristic of his earlier work"
1,"Here, in all their glory, is REM: the undisputed Pied Pipers of the bedwetters.  While Michael Stipe's nasal delivery evoked all the comfort of a German Stuka dive-bomber, the whimpering and ludicrous lyrical content became a beacon-call to legions of self-absorbed suburban cry-babies everywhere.  In REM, we had a calculating and maudlin brood of cynical mountebanks who lounged in opulence while tormenting their naive minions with a decades-long barrage of unrestrained nonsense and pessimistic doomsaying.  The embarrassing spectacle probably hit its painful peak in 1992, but it obviously has left a cultural skid mark that will take years to eradicate.  This album is a one star stinker that might serve well as a gag gift"
5,"""Honky Chateau"" is an example of why Greatest Hits albums just do not work for great artists. This early Elton John effort is an example of when John and Taupin had some edge and grit to their songs with some western influence. The whole album seems interconnected with excellent music, vocals and words that bond to one of their greatest collaborations. ""Rocket Man"" was the big hit during the albums original debut but the many of the other songs were virtually bigger in quality and longevity. ""Honky Cat"" starts with a smart jazzy sound with Elton in a cocky voice talking about his ""redneck ways"" that jumps and hops but in the next song he steps down and eases into the song ""Mellow"", which slows up to a laid back story of love behind close doors with a lover that makes him sing in a tired but pleased voice ""You make me mellow, oh you make me mellow"" and the song does make you ease into feeling the mellow he sings about. I like the sound and lyrics of all the songs but the oddly up tempo song about a typical teenager being morose in ""I think I am going to Kill Myself"" is spritely entertaining sound of a youth complaining about small transgressions like not using the car then he downshifts suddenly  down in a lyrical sound into a slowing middle eight of ""Get a little headline news, I'd like to see what the papers say, On the state of teenage blues"", particularly when Elton soulfully extends the word blues into a long bluesy wail that just puts this song in a unique category. Salvation is an almost gospel sounding song that starts off slow with ""I have to say my friends, this road goes a long, long way"" with great guitars and backing harmonies that is virtually uplifting in a sound that is optimistic in spite of the challenges exposed in the lyrics. ""Amy"" is just a fun tune that sounds like a young man teased by a wild and more mature woman and he sings with pain and but with optimism in his voice ""Amy I may not be James Dean, Amy I may not be nineteen, And I may still be in romper boots and jeans, But Amy you're the girl that wrecks my dreams"". One of the ultimate classics is ""Mona Lisa"" an up lifting song about a tough life in NY city that crosses the dimensions of different type of people, the poor and the affluent as Elton mournfully sings ""Until you've seen this trash can dream come true, You stand at the edge while people run you through, And I thank the Lord there's people out there like you, I thank the Lord there's people out there like you"" that in the end is uplifting, that he has found something and someone in a tough time and place. Finishing with a flourish, ""Hercules"" is a rollicking tune about being in love with a woman who is unfortunately in love with a muscleman, a ""cat named Hercules"".  The song has John with an excellent vocal with backing vocals with a touch of beach boys' sound and although the song seems to end in defeat, it sounds like the man will persevere with a touch of humor. ""Rocket Man"" is the classic song that Elton used to sing for 20 minutes in concert and it is a great song about a man being a long way from home in a cold desolate environment but the whole album is full of great songs and perhaps this is the best John/Taupin collaboration. The additional alternate version of the western sounding ""Slave"" is more up tempo than the original and is very good but the core 10 songs are just wonderful and always memorable.          "
2,"High record sales are often inversely proportionate to the effect on the morale of the bands concerned. Blur became household names in Britain because of this album, especially through cheerful cockney singalong sinle ""Parklife"", but it messed them up in terms of moving on as a band: it is also the album which was responsible for singer/writer Damon Albarn's mental breakdown.   But what did they expect? This is , after all, the album that summed up Britain's geezer culture: where men are men and women act like men as well. Where the Thatcherism of the 80s has never really gone away, and it's okay to Look After Number 1 and act like a bit or a moron. This album, for better or worse (in my opinion, worse) is more representative of Britain in the 90s and noughties than anything else. If you're American and still think that Britain is all Hugh Grants and tea on the village green, forget it. And here's the proof.  The album itself is cheerful enough, but totally uninspired. It bears none of the influence from American acts of the 80s and 90s, like Nirvana, Sonic Youth, the Meat Puppets or Dinosaur Jr., or Brit acts like My Bloody Valentine. Guitarist Graham Coxon's love of these bands hardly shows in the songs, because they're written by Albarn. Just tunes, many of which are distinctly ordinary. Even much-lauded songs like ""This Is a Low"" are let-downs, because they don't display any real savvy for what makes modern music any different from the songcraft of the Beatles or the Kinks. Indeed, Blur are just like a modern Kinks. Just without the great songs.  It's sad that with this album, Blur confirmed what the title of their previous album had said. Modern life IS rubbish"
1,I received the first recording and in the final movement there was a bad skipping. I notified Amazon and they sent me another recording which had the same problem. I received a credit and Amazon said the recording was evidently a bad one and they would check it out. Thanks Billy Lede
1,"Dont buy this CD. I dont know what all the hype is about, but boy was I fooled. The lyrics and the flow are below average, and yeah, there are some weird sounds in there, but the beats are nothing special either. I bought this, put it in my car, and within a couple songs I had to turn it off. I tried the next day, same thing. There is a lot of good underground hip-hop out there, so buy some of it instead"
5,"Psychedelia and hip-hop. Those are two words I never thought I'd be relating when referring to one of my favorite albums of 2005. I still can't get over it. What a phenomenal idea. The Boston based rapper Edan possesses more than just an untouchable flow. He's also the producer, programmer, engineer, sampler...you name it, he does it all. The production held within is bafflingly perfect. He's successfully brought the feel of a 60s psychedelic record to the form of hip-hop, including the concept. Clocking in at roughly 34 minutes (as most 60s psychedelic records run), there is absolutely no wasted space. This is an album of epic proportions that rides the line of psychedelia and hip-hop cleaner than you can imagine. It's almost puzzling that a hip-hop record including heavy influence of The Beach Boys' ""Pet Sounds"", The Beatles' ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"", or Pink Floyd's ""Piper At The Gates Of Dawn"" would come off as such a cohesive set of gems. But it does, and Edan proves he's the man for the job.  The album's intro, ""Polite Meeting Intro"", starts it off with some music that could be from Sponge Bob Squarepants, then with the addition of trippy sound effects and vintage English vocal samples, we end up in The Beatles' ""Yellow Submarine"". It sets it off nicely. Then comes ""Funky Voltro"" featuring Insight, which includes a high-pitched swooping Minimoog played by Edan, and also a funky guitar sample. Then comes ""I See Colours"", a clear standout featuring a synthesizer played by Edan. Edan proves to have a impenetrable flow here, boasting some imaginative lyrics that work very well with the sweet atmospheric soundscapes and soothing 60s vocal and guitar samples. The next cut, ""Fumbling Over Words That Rhyme"", is also one of my favorites. Edan pays homage to some of the great innovators in hip-hop, including Run D.M.C., Grandmaster Flash Flash, Melle Mel, Kool Moe Dee, LL Cool J, Slick Rick, Nas and Ultramagnetic MC's among others. It seems that a lot of rappers tend to make an ""homage"" to old-school emcees, but Edan simply does it better by explaining ""why"" they were true innovators, which is much better in the eyes of this reviewer. ""Murder Mystery"" is a sweet track with some music similar to Jimi Hendrix's ""Are You Experienced"" with that reverse rhythm, then cuts in with instrumentation that sounds like it could be from the old ""Odd Couple"" tv show. The next cut, ""Torture Chamber"" featuring flows by Percee P, speeds things up with a dirtier beat, orchestra string arrangements, and a background Pink Floyd sample from ""Dark Side Of The Moon"". Then comes the best collaborative effort on the album; ""Making Planets"" featuring Mr. Lif. Lif was actually the one who turned me on to Edan, as he was featuring on Lif's ""Emergency Rations"" EP and his critically acclaimed ""I Phantom"". The production is especially creepy here, as Lif jumps in towards the end at the climax of the song. ""Time Out (Segue)"" is a tripped out interlude that blends perfectly to the next superior cut, ""Rock and Roll"" featuring Dagha. Which features some cool crunching guitars in it's very memorable production. I also love this lyric - ""My mental fabric / to big for Lenny Kravitz / Who imitates Jimi Hendrix in every facet"". ""Beauty"" is up next. This song is really one of my favorites. Like it's title, the soulful production is beautiful. The addictive reverse rhythm, tight drum loops, and soaring flute makes it a huge standout. I also love this lyric - ""I use pens like hallucinogens"". It mixes beautifully into ""The Science of the Two"" featuring Insight once again. This is another one of my favorites (it just keeps getting better as it goes). ""Smile"" is one of the trippier tracks on the album. He couldn't have closed out the album better, than with ""Promised Land"", definitely a standout. It's got a very memorable production, and some sick lyrical spitting from the one, the only, Edan.  I see some people complaining about the short run time (34 minutes). I on the other hand, think it's perfect. There is so much filler in today's hip-hop (underground included), that it's nice to have 13 powerful, memorable, carefully crafted tracks to concentrate on. I've spent most of my teen years listening to 60s and 70s psychedelic records, along with a wide array of classic rock, so it may be a bit more intriguing to me than the next hip-hop head, but this stuff is truly unique. Edan may have been paying tribute to hip-hop's greatest innovators lyrically, but he's also paid tribute to 60s and 70s psychedelia in one of the most memorable ways possible; through hip-hop"
5,"For whatever reason I bought this album much later on than the other two English Beat albums - something about it &quot;not being as good&quot;. That's complete nonsense. This album is excellent and it was a welcome revelation to hear it years later, after the fact as it were. There's not a weak track on this CD. Plenty of soulful saxophone solos abound. &quot;Dreamhome in NZ&quot;, &quot;Walk Away&quot;, and &quot;Monkey Murders&quot; are lost 80's classics to go along with the better-known &quot;Doors of Your Heart&quot; and &quot;Too Nice to Talk To&quot;. Love the alternate version of &quot;Get-A-Job&quot; found here. I rank this second Beat album in the all-too-short trilogy of albums from these guys right up there next to &quot;I Just Can't Stop It&quot;; it's certainly a stronger album from start to finish than &quot;Special Beat Service&quot; - their final album - where the strain of not having widespread commercial acceptance sounded like it had taken its toll. Looking back, I wish the English Beat had stayed together long enough to record a few more gems like &quot;Wha'ppen?&quot;. They probably do too"
4,"Though John Mayer is new to me, I have always liked the 'soft rock' genre. I got drawn in by the easy rock guitar selections, (especially 'Clarity') and listening to the lyrics came later.   John Mayer...easy on my ears. I'll try another CD. I think this music could grow on me."
2,"I'm a huge fan of pretty girls make graves. Their first two albums really rocked the joint. But I'm sorry to report that this album really doesn't add up. It just doesn't make much sense to me at all. There is none of that old magic which really made the other albums rock here!   instead they've gone for a really lazy, laid back style which doesn't hold yer interest. for example one song starts off with a crunchy rocking guitar riff, which sounds promising enough, but then it disappears and is replaced by a dull bass line and doesn't re-appear at all. They then get bored of the bass line and move on to something else at which point the song ends!! the whole album goes like that. Songs barely get going and then promptly end.  The second guitar play has disappeared to! which means you don't get that cool guitar interplay sound which defined their other albums ( I reckon he was the talented one). They've replaced 2nd guitar with a keyboard player who, i kid u not, puts samples of fireworks in one song!! (I've said enough)  C'mon people! lets have a bit of structure/effort/balls. I heard that andrea's vocals are shot n' the doc said she had to cool it down, so I can only assume they are trying to change their direction or something.. But they are heading in the direction of Dido or goldfrapp or something bad like that.   I've listened to the album about 12 times now and can honestly say not a single one really sticks out in my mind.. What d'you guys think about it?  I hope they get their acts together and recover from this droop.  It's like Henry Rollins Said ""If you aint gonna put 110% in don't even bother"" "
5,This was also a very influential Hip Hop album (Biggie Smalls)one of the best rappers ever classic album kane was the biggie of the 80's nobody could touch him
2,I only liked one song on the CD - all others were just average
5,"Veteran rocker Joe Grushecky is back with a new CD, entitled A Good Life. In an age where there's possible instant fame with TV shows and slick videos, Grushecky did it the old fashioned way: grinding it out in clubs and theatres over the years. Starting 25 years ago with his band, The Iron City Houserockers, Grushecky's always been part working class hero & part philosopher. It's a combination that has held up over time and this new CD is full of tunes that will make you think as well as crank up the stereo. Gary Borress, NY"
2,"I'm sure this won't win me any popular votes but, this musical is one that I feel I have to comment on. What has happened to Broadway? Why has London's West End taking over the musical theatre industry? Well, when Broadway produces musicals such as ""Little Women.""  As a fan of the book I had high hopes for the show expecting it to be as beautiful as ""The Secret Garden"" or ""Jane Eyre."" But, this musical does not enhance the book in fact it morphs it into some kind of mindless garbage.  The songs are mindless garbage with no feeling, depth, or emotion and listening to the CD is what one Broadway fan might consider torture. There are a few exceptions ""Take A Chance On Me"" and ""Small Umbrella In The Rain"" somehow manage to stand out but,are not enough to save this show from a slow death on Broadway.   The cast is dim witted and has little to no connection to the actual characters they are meant to play... Susan Foster who is well known as Millie does a decent job as Joe but, misses that magic sparkle and tom-boy nature that one would expect from the character Joe. Danny Gurwin- however makes a breakthrough apperance as Laurie seeming to be just about perfect and should have recieved a Tony nomination ... I can only hope he makes a few CDs after this show.  It's obvious why when you listen to ""Little Women""- how it came to die slowly and painfully on Broadway- the songs and the script lack the sentiments in the book- with no real love story... or perfect ending this musical is a truly tragic loss.  Made for the sole purpose of becoming a money maker knowing that fans of the book would stand by the show- the producers seemed to hope to make a quick buck. But, I will not stand by this show- their is something in the story that could be turned into a musical that fans could enjoy. All in all Broadway needs something more and fans need something else.."
5,"Does anyone know about if the second page of the lyrics book is supposed to have writing on it? I was looking through it and it looks as though somone actualy wrote in the golden box on the second page of my lyrics book. Its writen in a blue sparkly pen. Was wondering if Utada herself wrote it, cus it dosen't look like a computer did it. Anyway it says shishunki in kanji wich means puberty basicaly. I got the album in japan on a trip this week. Just wondering if anybody had any insite. Thanks. Oh and Yah this album rocks. Shes my favorite Jp artist"
2,...but every song on the album sounds the same. And I happen to like them. Disappointed
5,"For the money this cd is great.  Some good songs, #'s:1,2,8,9,10 and the NOFX song at the end is great.  Its definitelyworth the money. But if it were 13 bucks I would be so sur"
2,"ok i've listened to this album quite a few times and still have yet to find a strong point. i didn't get his first album so i'm not comparing like some reviewers may. ""on again tonight"" is the reason i   bought this album and it's one of the only songs i like on it. some people who really like this cd will say ""don't listen to him"". or something like that but i'm right. a few of these songs aren't very well written and just trail off. as far as his voice goes, even if he has range, his voice isn't very good. i mean i like his voice on ""beer man"" and ""on again to night"" but some of these songs his voice makes sound worse. although some songs are ok none are exactly good. if you don't have the new toby keith, little big town, gary allan, jason aldean, jamey johnson, or brad paisley album(to name a few) get one of those cause ALL of them are much better than this.  don't waste your money on it...i di"
1,"Hello, I think that Robin Gibb, this making the ridicule. That he sings their songs like soloist and don't try to imitate the voice of Barry. That it hurts that Robin, this destroying the great called myth: BEE GEES.      Armando Lobos      Chil"
5,"Riot Act should have won album of the year!  Although listening to the album 4 years after it was originally released, I am so glad I got back into Pearl Jam.  I have not listened to Pearl Jam since high school--I can't believe I deprived myself for so long!  Pearl Jam is the best rock band of my generation.  Hopefully, they will stick together and put out several more albums down the road.  For those of you not sure if Pearl Jam still has it, trust me THEY DO!!!  Buy this album, you will be in for a pleasant surprise..."
5,This is Najee at his best. I'm glad he's back and better than ever
2,"Around the turn of the century, record companies began to released one disc compilations that attempted to take artists with a ton of output and try to make an 80 minute attempt to capture the essentials. Needless to say, all of these attempts have failed. Great songs were overlooked, and instead of giving a quality overview of the band, one got instead the feeling of being ripped off. The Cure's Greatest Hits falls victim to the one disc overview.  A greatet hit album serves two purposes. One is to collect the best for fans who may desire to have many of their favorites on one album. The second is to provide new-comers to the band an overview of their career. The problem with The Cure is that they have released over 30 singles, and no single disc set can truly capture the best of their work.  For instance, how does a Cure best of ignore ""Pictures of You""? It would be akin to a Billy Joel best of leaving off ""The Stranger"". This song is considered one of the Cure's best, and leaving this off for stuff like ""The Walk"", ""High"", and ""Never Enough"" is an insult.  While ""Pictures of You"" is the biggest example of a song that is missing, there are plenty of other songs of lesser impact that still should have been on there. For instance, the sublime ""Catch"", the melancholy ""A Night Like This"", or even ""Jumping Someone Else's Train."" And what about their break-out single, ""Killing An Arab""?  The problem with this album is that it attempts to provide an overview of the Cure but instead only barely touches the surface. Leave this one on the CD racks and spend the extra money to get Staring at the Sea and Galore"
1,"OH PLEASE SAVE ME FROM THESE BOY BANDS. THERE ARE WAY TOO MANY BOYBANDS OUT NOW. AND WHO IS THE WORLD IS C-NOTE. THEY ARENT EVEN FAMOUS AND NOBODY EVEN KNOWS WHO THEY ARE. N-E-WAYS THEY DONT SOUND GOOD AT ALL AND IM GLAD I DIDNT WASTE MY MONEY BY BUYING THIS CD. SO IF YOU REALLY WANT TO LISTEN TO A BOY BAND GO AND LISTEN TO NSYNC, BACKSTREET BOYS, OR 98 DEGREES CAUSE AT LEAST THEY KNOW HOW TO SING"
2,"What they said was that Katy can't rock just yet because she's a raw talent and not yet coherent in theme.  I saw her live on the Chicks with Attitude tour with Liz Phair and the Cardigans and Charlotte Martin and Rose was the worst performer of the night.  The first problem is that her voice just isn't that strong, secondly, her lyrics never come out as if they're honest and as if they are always a pretension that people feel a cool girl growing up should say.  Throughout her set, there was only one song that stuck out as an interesting and unique thing (passingly honest as well) and that was ""Snowflake.""  It's fitting that the song was preceded by an ironic intro about how she's lived in California for a long time, but she hates warm weather, sounds impossible, but she must be truthful because it's the only song that breaks out of the leaden grunge guitar mix and hits the audience over the head with songcraft.  I'm sure she has potential for the future, but I think on her next album she should take a hint from Beth Orton who's known previous to her most recent album for being a popular artist in the realm of trip hop.  Stripping down your sound brings the utmost fundamentals of your idea and sound out, and I think that could be helpful for her to put on record"
5,"Wow, I just received ""Reiter In"" and am in agreement with other reviewers.  Chris Whitley has always been a favorite of mine, ever since the stunning debut of ""Living With the Law"".  I saw Chris on tour supporting that album in Seattle, on a double bill with Toad the Wet Sprocket.  The auditorium was packed with young Seattle suburbanites to see Toad, then when Chris took stage, half the place emptied out.  The faithful, knowing remainders witnessed a typical Chris show; searing, passionate, but also flawed and overly amplified.  Chris chain-smoked the entire show, and said little to the audience, but when I left I knew I'd seen an artist with no peer.  ""Reiter In"" is an amazing cd-probably for the first time, Chris sounds like part of a band and not just a phenomenal solo artist in front of backing musicians.  Although unpolished and recorded to analog, the band is cohesive, lending a jukejoint feel to Chris' guitar playing.  This music doesn't even directly compare to his previous stuff-it's got elements of Led Zeppelin/The Black Keys/""Achtung Baby"" U2, with some Depression era blues tossed in between.  Rather than annotating his impending death with dusty acoustic dirges, Chris gave us sweaty, soulful, life-affirming music, a most fitting end-note"
2,"Well, before buying this I had never even heard of bright eyes.  Just so you know my background, I generally dislike indie and Emo.  I usually listen to hardcore and Screamo.  But for some reason I became interested in this band.  (or person) Someone compared a CD of their's to A Death Cab CD.  Me being a pretty big Death Cab fan, I decided to go out and buy this EP to see if I liked this band at all.  This review is the result of that listen.  The EP opens up with the slow acoustic guitar picks of ""a line allows prgress""...  A few seconds into the song I am greeted with with drums and an organ.  This song sounds like a slower Cursive song.  The guy's voice sounds decent.  I guess the vocal effects he uses are for emotional purposes.  Overall this is a pretty decent song.  It reminds me of hotel california.  Next in line comes one of my favorite tracks on here:  ""a perfect sonnet"".  I don't know if it's the simple guitar stum or the sense that his voice is going to explode any moment.  Seriously, the whole song I was thinking that everything was about to fall apart...but it didn't.  He keeps going and going.  It must be his voice that creates this mood.  This was also the point of the CD where I realized that it was a bit more than music I was listening to.  Bright eyes will make you feel moods that other music can't.  It's got a unique brand of emotion that is new to me.  It's too bad this song ends so quickly.  As I press on to: ""on my way to work"" I begin to get the feel for the CD.  He's almost whispering on this track.  There's an odd sounding guitar picking and a country sounding synthesizer.  Quite frankly, I hate this song.  It sounds like an offkey country ballad...  Who wants that?  The next two tracks are more or less the same feel.  A new arrangement provides better quality music than the craptastic on my way to work, but doesn't reach the level of A perfect sonnet.  Finally, the EP is ended with the techno atmospheric: Neely o hara...  I don't know what to say.  It's meaningless.  I don't see how you can like this.  It's just pointless.  Overall this is a half and half EP.  The first two tracks are good...  But the rest of the CD falls between failing and decent.  If Bright Eyes good churn out more tracks like a perfect sonnet, this band would get at least a 4 star.  Sadly thats not the case.  So I don't recommend this for anyone other than the really dedicated fans.  Perhaps the other CD's are better"
5,"This ain't your Dad's Santana. Named for original Fleetwood Mac guitarist Peter Green's breathtaking blues instrumental (he also composed BLACK MAGIC WOMAN), here's the album that rescued the entirely deserving Carlos Santana from endless classic rock tour pergatory. Not since Tina Turner's ""I've still got legs"" comeback in the 80s has the music world witnessed such an unexpected and satisfying resurrection, thanks to the ingenious pairing of Mexico's guitar guru with a half dozen young disciples, and Eric Clapton tacked on for good measure. SMOOTH, the funky, blistering Rob Thomas collaboration that knocked doldrums-drenched radio on its keister at the turn of the century was the catylist, culminating in the Grammy's most decorated album ever (take THAT, Michael). Since Carlos Santana has always utilized a variety of vocalists (from Journey's Gregg Rolie to Buddy Miles to John Lee Hooker) and musical styles, hearing him play rock, hip-hop and jazz in tandem with everyone from Lauryn (Where'd she go, anyhoo?) Hill to Dave Matthews to Everlast is not such a far fetched notion.  MARIA MARIA even has the Product G&B extolling the virtues of ""Carlos Santana"" by name in their slniky groove-enriched rap. On the strictly Spanish-speaking side, CORAZON ESPINADO (featuring Mana) sounds infectious in ANY language, and the rest is the vintage Latino rock that this cat was blowin' light years before Ricky Martin was even a Menudo. When the musical history books are written, SUPERNATURAL will remain proof positive that, yes Virginia, there really IS a Santana claus. RATING: FIVE FIESTAS"
5,"I have seen the movie and bought the sound track. Having marinated my bones and psyche with Tibetans for over 25 years this soundtrack unites two ostensiby disparate cultures, America and Mongolia. As music is the one art form that transcends cultures, it is intersteing to hear the Blues united with their Asian cousins. The phenomenon of throat singing is what you have heard in Tibetan Monks chanting with the  ability to produce two tones simultaneously. Paul Pena, a black,  blind, blues singer from California, copped their gig and taught  himself how to do this. He went to Tuva and won their annual throat singing contest in his category. It is an exposure of the  roots. Like Mongolians don't get the Blues. For any armchair anthropoligist, this cd is a must. The movie will make you cry as you see the challenges that Paul faces, distantly empowered by the deceased physicist, Richard Feinman, who went to Tuva on his  last journey. Paul's trip is peppered with stickers that they  paste up, &quot; Feinman Lives&quot; Feinman was a great thinker from Far Rockaway, N.Y. who collected stamps from Tuva as a child. This record is strange and profound. Irresistable for any thinking person"
1,"... this is a subtle tip off that this album is not worth buying. Not for more than fifty cents.  Like I said, the ONLY good song on here is the Rolling Stones cover ""I'm Free"". And I even like The Soup Dragons' rendition better than the Stones' original. But the fact remains that the rest of this album is a dull drudgery of a mess to get through. This album is practically a single for ""I'm Free"", but with twelve extra songs of filler you'll never listen to more than once (if at all). Hmmm. What else can I say about ""I'm Free""? Oh, yea... the music video for the song is quite awesome. Its so trippy and tie-dyed out! But that still doesn't change my review. Or stoic state of mind.  One star out of five"
5,"Very nice CD, quite different from their other ones but quickly became my favorite"
5,"""Morning View"" in my opinion is the most different album by Incubus.  Their traditional sound lies within rock, hard rock, etc.  But this album is the one with the most chilled-out songs on it.  That is one of the reasons for this being my favorite Incubus album: its originality.    Mind you...if you like this album, don't attain the mindset of ""omg if I like this one I'll like their other albums too!""  It doesn't work that way; Incubus' other releases are nothing like this, with the exception of a few songs.  And now...let's move on to the song review.  Nice to Know You--A nice opening song.  I like the lyrics a lot, and the constant transission between heavy rock and slow beats gives the song a good rhythm.  8.5/10  Circles--Probably the one song on ""Morning View"" that is most like Incubus' other albums.  The guitar in the background is especially cool.  The chorus is also nice, and the lyrics really stay true to the song title.  8/10  Wish You Were Here--My favorite song on this CD by far.  The guitar riffs in this song are the greatest on the whole album.  The chorus is also very amazing, and so are the lyrics.  Quite possibly a perfect song.  10/10  Just a Phase--Probably the song with the mose meaningful lyrics on the album.  It starts off as an easy-going song with no lyrics and a catchy, steady beat and then is joined by powerful lyrics that have to do with going through a typical phase and how annoying it is to go through something like that.  9/10  11 A.M.--A song with a mixture of Incubus' rock and the slow beats on this CD.  This track acts as a bridge between the other albums and this album, in my opinion.  8.5/10  Blood on the Ground--Like Circles, this track is like Incubus' songs from other albums.  Not only that, but this song's lyrics are meaningful as well.  It portrays getting in fights, but not saying anything to the other person (hence ""Blood in my mouth beats blood on the ground"").  8/10  Mexico--The slowest song on here by far.  This is such a big step for incubus, because as far as I can tell, they have never done anything like this before.  This is why they are such an excellent band: they take risks by exploring other genres, and they do a good job at it too.  8.5/10  Warning--My second favorite track on the whole album.  I dunno why, but it is excellent.  The vocals and lyrics are the best here.  Especially the nice-sounding bit in which the vocals go ""We'll make millions writing a book on the way it should have been.""  Parts of this song like this one portray a great range in the vocals, which is why this is such a great song.  9.5/10  Echo--My favorite slow song.  The vocals sound very nice, especially the chorus.  The chorus alone is a reason to listen to this track over and over again.  9/10  Have you Ever--Not one of my personal favorites, but still a good track.  It resembles a lot of other Incubus songs on the other albums as well.  This song is basically about putting yourself in someone else's position before you judge them.  8/10  Are You In?--The most  pop-like song on the album.  I was surprised and happy to hear this song.  Again: Incubus is awesome at experimenting with new songs, and I must say, this one came out nicely.  9/10  Under my Umbrella--Also a lot like their other songs on albums such as ""Make Yourself.""  But the beginning vocals (""When I close my eyes..."") sound awesome, and so does the main singing.  Overall, a good track.  8.5/10  Aqueous Transmission--The most UNIQUE song ever done by Incubus EVER.  It includes instruments they've never used before, such as a Japanese flute.  It has a ""Crouching-Tiger, Hidden-Dragon"" feel to it, and it is enjoyable even for the sole reason that it is different from the rest of the songs.  The vocals are also great.  9/10  OVERALL score: 5 stars.  This is definitely the most unique, most laid-back album by Incubus.  It shows a lot of very successful experimentation as well.  I dunno what all this ""selling out"" talk is, but you should definitely buy this album.  It is much different from the other albums, and still manages to be one of Incubus' best albums"
1,"The Ying Yang Twins are so bad that it is not even funny. Now if they had talent then I could buy this CD, but that is not the case.."
4,"I had lost track of Steve Vai for a while....In the early 90's I bought ""Passion and Warfare""(an instant classic!!)but I did not buy anything after that, cause I just felt so good with Passion and Warfare that I didn't want to be let down by his next releases. Deep inside, I must have thoght that might happen... Well resently I stopped by sony's website, and I fell in love with the sound clips for this CD. I bought it, and I have been enchanted ever since! It's a different CD, but no disapointments. Some fans don't like Steve's singing, but what he sings here is ok. It won't hurt. This is a statement, and I can't wait to hear part 2 and 3 when they are released"
2,"I was given this CD from my sister, who knows I love to dig into up and coming bands.  I was not impressed.  The only song I found to be fairly original, in at least the sound, was In the Woods, which I wouldn't list as the fulcrum this album turns on.  The remainder of this album disappointed me with its appeal to emotion that was trying a little too hard (as is the style these days), hammering out repeated chords and vocals that have that familiar deep delicate sound.  Now, I don't like Coldplay.  I don't have any of their albums.  I hate to say this, but it almost sounds like Levy is really trying to pull off some Coldplay covers.  Make sure you listen to the samples before you buy this CD, because I'd hate for someone to accidently buy A Rush of Blood to the Head Part II."
4,"Ok, I got this CD about year ago or something, and never got the chance to write a review about it. She is a really good singer, and that's really good for a girl at such a young age. The first song I ever heard by her was ""Leave (get out)"" and I liked it a little bit then, but now I really like it! She may be a little too young to sing what she sings about, but the songs are still really good! Well, here it is:  1. Breezy - 10/10 A really interesting and creative beginning to the album! She uses loud vocals in this song, too, which makes it stand out a lot.  2. Baby it's you - 10/10 A great single! This song is very sweet, and is pretty easy to understand in some parts.  3. Not that kinda girl - 10/10 This is one of her latest singles on her CD, and it's a very nice song! In this song she basically talks about what she is and what she isn't, and I really like music that does that sort of stuff.  4. The happy song - 8/10 This one is ok, but not my favorite. The tune is a little too orignal in my opinion, but the lyrics are pretty good.  5. Homeboy - 10/10 Great song, although I never really liked the word ""homeboy"". But, the tune is very familiar and very pretty.  6. City lights - 7.5/10 This one isn't that great, particularly because of the guys that come up some point in this song and start to rap. It just sounds a little werid, and I never liked rap.  7. Leave (Get out) - 10/10 Awesome single! It's one of the only songs on here that stands out, and it's great to dance to! The music video is pretty cool too, check it out!  8. Use my shoulder - 7/10 Ok, I think she could've picked a better chorus tune than this one, cuz this one was just annoying and boring. But as always, the lyrics are good.  9. Never say goodbye - 10/10 Beautiful! This tune is VERY familiar! It sounds to me like she did a remake of it or something, cuz it's got a beautiful tune and beautiful lyrics. This song can also be used as a lullaby to put someone to sleep. :-P  10. Weak - 6/10 UGH! This song is just soooooooo long and boring! Although the lyrics are always good, this song is just too original.  11. Keep on Keepin' on - 9/10 This is the first song on this ablum that's written by JoJo herself! She did a great job on it, too. The lyrics are just so true!  12. Sunshine - 9/10 Another song that she wrote, and it's just as good. I like the tune also, it's very nice.  13. Yes or no - 9/10 This is a good one too, and another one that she wrote (along with others, of course). I really like the beginning, it's one of those beginnings you would'nt expect in a song lol.  14. Fairy Tales - 7/10 I guess this is a nice ending, but the song itself isn't too great. I'm sure she could've made a better tune than this boring one. I'm into pop and energetic music, not usually slow songs like this!  Overall, cool CD. If you've heard any of JoJo's music, I'm sure you'd like her album. Also, keep and eye out for her new album titled ""The high road"" coming out on October 17th! I can't wait to get it myself, especially after hearing her cool new song, ""Too little too late"""
1,"I would say get this for the Song tommorow by Saif keta but the One song if you Watch the Flim very Closly was when Ali and his brother paid Jamie Fox a visit in the Hotel and Ali riding on the Train  , That Track was By Johnny Farmer a Old school Blues song Called Death Letter , with Great vocals this song is not on Soundtrack ""why? It is the best song in the whole damn Movie  I wonder where I can get it like it was song in the Movie ? if you know let me know "
5,"I don't have much to add.  If you love Seger, get this CD.  LOVE IT"
1,"I cannot imagine what Sony or their sad, sad technicians were thinking - or NOT thinking when they ""remastered"" this great musical.  I HOPE - and one can only hope - whomever it was that ""remastered"" this music (and I can't imagine why they would call it re-MASTERED) that they got FIRED afterwards or went back to basic recording school.  MASTERING a musical CD means that you check your levels and balance - something they either forgot to do or were too busy talking while they should have been listening to what they were doing.  Did Sony imagine they'd be able to sell this on it's own merits...that being an attractive, well known, sell-able music CD of a charming musical - while duping the buying public (sadly ME included) that it would be something worth having for any Broadway music collection??  Well I was most assuredly fooled.  Even with my cheap (Sony by the way) 2 track tape deck could have come up with better than this rendition.  I just cannot abide that some highly technical ""master"" of recording equipment couldn't fix this before the thing was committed to a glass cd master to be cut in quantity, offered and distributed as a ""remastered"" version that SHOULD have been BETTER than the original but sadly isn't even close.  I thankfully, still have a cassette tape version of this musical from when it was first released many years ago and prefer that to this impossible display of cd ""mastering"" I have EVER heard - and I've heard a lot of quality remastered CD's - but this isn't one of them.  THE ONLY saving grace of this CD is some of the extras that have been included.  But not at full price..if you ask me.  Think twice or at least understand at the outset what you're getting....a very poorly ""rekindled - NOT remastered"" CD that has some singers sounding as if the ""technicians"" forgot to bring up the volume on those tracks.  Pretty sad, pretty sad.  Disappointing.  Love the musical - HATE the lousy CD"
4,"A recent Rolling Stone issue listed the 100 greatest guitarists and omitted this fine(probably 1 of 10 or so, blues greats) performer. Though it is hard to be totally objective as I have both seen and met this great guy on a few occasions, there really is no one who plays as well or has this TONE. He is a fantastic blues and jazz virtuoso, and is certainly headed for greater recognition. I prefer his own writing and that is what kept me from giving this 5 stars as there are a couple of covers included here that are not of the same caliber. Thank you, Robben for another very good recording/perfomance"
1,"32 years ago I was so stoked that Clapton was finally coming out with a new album, I walked five miles to Deorsey's Records in Lewiston, Maine the day that it was released to buy this much anticipated record. The still near virgin vinyl remains in my LP collection and has only been played once. Once was enough. Heroin robbed a true master of his creativeness, inspiration and technical ability. Sad."
2,"Watched the movie on DVD, loved it so much I immediately got on-line and bought the soundtrack.  One of the things I liked about the movie is the juxtaposition of ballroom music and hiphop.  The soundtrack for this movie about ballroom dancing does not have a single track of the ballroom music on it!  What's up with that?"
5,"First my review:  The recorded legacy of MJH falls into roughly five categories.   (1) his early 1928 recordings on the OKEH label which comprise around 20 tracks. Although they are quite listenable and of historical interest and importance they are not the most enjoyable of his recordings. (2) recordings from 1963 that are available on the Rounder label. The sound quality of these recordings is somewhat disappointing. For that reason alone I don't listen to them much except for the fact that they were heavily relied upon by people who transcribed his songs for instructional materials. (3) The Library of Congress recordings (also from 1963). These are perhaps the best. The sound quality is excellent and there is an informality to the sessions which makes it like having MJH as a house guest for the weekend determined to play you every song he knows. (4) The (these) Vanguard Recordings, which I think were recorded between 1967 and 1969. These rival and sometimes surpass the Library of Congress Recordings as far as the material goes. There is also a palpable sadness as you can detect a man near the end of his life aware of the fact that he may very well be making his final recordings. The audio engineers did a terrible job at Vanguard for a good deal of these recordings. How can you screw up recording just one guy with a guitar? If you try hard enough you can set the levels WAY off. That is how. (5) there is also a Live MJH CD from Vanguard. It's sound quality is pretty good and it is endearing to hear MJH talk to an audience, but I find it less compelling material wise than the studio recordings.  Listening to MJH makes you want to piick up the guitar and learn to play like him. The good thing about this is that if you really want to you probably can. Many of his songs have been transcribed and broken down in intructional books and DVDs. After going through a ""beginning fingerpicking"" DVD by Stefan Grossman you are probably ready to take on MJH.  Go for it!  And now for my question:  It's not obvious to me from the Vanguard website whether the boxed set is actually a newer digital remaster than the original digital re-masters from the mid 80s. As far as digital remasters go those ones were a bit of a disaster. When you put the disc into your player you would have to crank the volume on your stereo. As you might expect, the careless lack of attention to levels setting in the remastering process resulted in a mushy sounding guitar. I seem to remember that was also a problem with the vinyl Vanguard LPs, particularly the first one. Hopefully these CDs really  are *new* remasters because most CDs re-mastered these days are remastered quite well.  My music management software for encoding MP3s has the capability of looking up CDs in an online database. Whenever I present it with copies of the old mid 1980s vanguard CDs it recognizes them as possibly being from the boxed set, so I hesitate to spring for the ""new remasters"" without really knowing if they are indeed recently remastered. Perhaps someone else could clear this up"
5,"It continues to amaze me to find ""new"" musicians who record in bedroom studios all across the country. Everyone was amazed when Craig Chaquico pulled this off, Roger takes it to the next level. The closest event I can recall to this release is Steely Dan's 1972 ""Can't Buy a Thrill"" that put pop/rock on its ear. The influences are many and varied...Beach Boys, Beatles, Osmonds, Neil Sedaka, Jimmy Webb, The Who, Styx, Yes, Chicago, Alan Parsons, ELO/Jeff Lynn, Astrud Giberto, Wondermints, Burt Bacharach, Supertramp, 60's Brit Pop, the list goes on... As for Roger's vocal ability, he's no Bocelli, but he is better than 90% of the front men out there.  He has a unique ""honey"" styled voice with a smoothness not often heard these days (think Joseph Williams, David Pack, Donnie Osmond, Gerry Beckley).  He doesn't try to imitate anyone, and has learned to be comfortable using his instrument as intended and well trained.  Primarily a keyboardist, his chops on guitars and drums are commendable as well.  Can't think of enough good things to say about this artist.  Not every cut is excellent, but eight of eleven are standouts and addictive.  The three deleted cuts from Solid State Warrior make for eleven very strong songs that could all be at home on the top 40...during some point of time. Buy this CD Now"
5,"If this music doesn't make you get out of your chair, nothing will!  Not only are the CDs filled with big hits, but even the less widely known tunes will get your heart pounding.  Great for reminiscing, great for exercising, great for making work go faster...just GREAT"
1,"If you're not anal about sound quality then please skip this review.   That said, this DTS disc sounds terrible. Why?   1- If you're even vaguely familiar with this album or the songs, you will hardly recognize them here. The multi-channel mix is way out of phase from the original stereo mix; in other words, they sound totally different from each other.   2- This disc doesn't have the fidelity of the SONY re-mastered Abraxas. The tape hiss is very noticeable, and the overall sound is very dull. Just compare this disc with the newer re-mastered version and you will hear the difference immediatley.  Save your money and ""maybe"" someday SONY will release a multi-channel SACD from the same source as the rather excellent re-mastered cd"

4,"I loved this musical when I went to see it in late March of 2006. But unforutunately the only reason why I didn't give this 5 stars is because this soundtrack doesn't have exactly what I saw on stage, and I loved that better. This is an awesome soundtrack though.  When I went to see this musical, only 3 members of the original cast were still on the play: Norbert Leo Butz as ""Freddy,"" Joanna Gleason as ""Muriel,"" and Gregory Jbara as ""Andre."" But, that night I went to see it, Gergory Jbara was substituted by Dennis Parlato, so I really only saw 2 original cast members.  Normally when you see a musical on stage or on film for the first time, you don't really get the ""entire"" taste of the music part because you have to concentrate on the story, the characters, and what's going on and what you're looking at. Sometimes its even hard to remember the music you heard until you listen to it again without visual aid, unless the performance of the songs were very memorable. And the song that really stuck out here was Norbert's performance of ""Great Big Stuff."" His physical comedy and every single word rang with crass wit that was over the top and just begs you for more. Norbert Leo Butz plays ""Freddy Benson"" by the way.  When I saw the play, Johnathan Pryce was playing the part of ""Laurence Jameson."" And Pryce is an actual British person, which kind of made his role more believable. His voice really fit the part. John Lithgow at times appears to lose his accent in the soundtrack. John Lithgow isn't bad for the part though, and when he has to impersonate an Austrian Doctor, he does an over the top job.   Dennis Parlato (Jbara's substitute) I believe did a better job at playing a Frenchman. His accent seemed less forced than Gregory's here. Gregory brings a much more ""snooty"" personality to Andre than Dennis did. Maybe that's what was originally intended perhaps.  Mylinda Hall played Jolene Oaks when I saw it, and in my opinion she did a far more fantastic job than Sara Gettelfinger. Sara sounds a bit too ""mature"" and a little older too. Jolene is supposed to be young, dumb, and full of fun!  Now Sherie Rene Scott does a fantastic job at playing ""Christine Colgate"" and better than Rachel York, the girl I saw. Rachel York was good, but Sherie does a good job at being a ditz, like Christine is supposed to be. She hits those high notes with ease and gives a nice flair of innocence in her role.  ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"" is a great musical adaptation to a movie, and I believe that you can buy the soundtrack before seeing the play but vice versa. However, if you are listening to the soundtrack before seeing the play, you better take ""A Message from John Lithgow"" very seriously because you won't enjoy the play as much if you see it after listening to the soundtrack. So do what John Lithgow says!  "
1,"No melody, no rhythm; just noise. I'm heading to the used CD store with it as soon as I can. I'd rate it zero stars if I coul"
5,"Musical genius to the limit. It Ain't No Use it the most beautiful song ever written - I have listened to this over and over and over again for years, and will continue to do so."
1,"Led Zeppelin were simply the most overrated band of all time who were just as bad as NIRVANA and ACDC. They only made about a decent song in ""Stairway To Heaven"". Rest of the songs just STINK!!! Plant sounds more like a big monkey than a real singer and can't sing at all, HE JUST SCREAMS. Like good singers??????? I recommend go with Foreigner, Dire Straits who were equally the greatest bands with the greatest singers in LOU GRAMM, and MARK KNOPFLER. They are a billion times better than LED ZEPPELIN. Don't listen to the five star reviewers of this page, avoid this piece of junk and go with Foreigner insted. They are legends, not ZEPPELIN!!"
5,"""Hey hey mama, said the way you move, Gonna make you sweat gonna mak you groove..."" is the opening line to an epic album if there ever was one.  I can not imagine how to sit down and write a song like a Led Zepplin song. To create a song with the charge of ""Rock and Roll"", or the lyrics to ""Battle of Evermore"", to create something like these epic songs is something that beyond me; and as for ""Stairway"" I think that's beyond any of us mortals. The popular ""Stairway"" had a seemingly unreal start when one day Robert Plant had a pencil and paper and Jimmy Page was just strumming when Plant described it as ""my hand just started writing out the words. I just sat there and looked at them and almost leapt out of my seat."" The song has gone on to capture immortality in the music world and is the most frequently played song in American history, which is pretty good seeing how it was never released as an actual single. But it is not just a Zepplin CD with ""stairway"" on it. It is has so much to offer in every track.  I have grown up with these songs, and if you've ever seen a Ford commercial or just listened to the radio, chances are that you have had these songs in your head one way or another even if you don't know who Led Zepplin is. But the one song that has always unrightfully gone in the shadows of ""Stairway"" is ""When the Levee Breaks"". I always personally found ""Levee"" as the strongest song in Zoso; but i dare not compare two songs of their caliber. But ""Levee"" brings this epic Album to an extraordinary close. After every listen, I find it hard to believe that there is only Eight tracks, because it sucks you into a world of enormous sound and mystery, and after you have listened to ZOSO whether it be the first time or if it's been too many to count, it leaves you with a sense that you have heard something special, done by a band with a sound that is larger than life.   Essential Recording. No exceptions"
1,"This is one of the seminal albums of the Two-Tone movement, but don't buy this castrated version"
1,"Like almost all rock bands to have formed within the past 10 years, 3 Doors Down is disposable, all their songs sound dull and boring (their all the same too), they belong in the same category as Creed and Nickelback in the ""Lullaby Rock"" subgenre. It's this kind of stuff, along with emo, Limp Bizkit, and ICP, that is killing rock"
2,"Ya know, when i heard that mobb deep signed to g-unit i was MORE suprised that 50 cent was ACTUALLY familiar with a group as great as Mobb Deep. I didn't even think 50 knew mobb deep existed let a lone that they were legends in new york. I mean i know 50's from nyc but think about it....new york IS one of the top 10 most populated cities in the WORLD. N-e-wayz....yo this CD is definately different from their earlier works on ""hell on earth"" and ""the infamous"" albums. But just because it's different doesn't mean that i'm impressed. Obviously, mobb deep is tired of rapping about things that are real where they grew up and they've given up by signing with 50 to make more money. I mean....it's all on their titles on the list of songs. Does this all mean that their sellouts? Well....considering i'm a mean critic of true underground hip hop music...I'm really not sure. Every artist/groups have different intentions. I mean...with a group as big as this...maybe theres a motive to their madness??? I'm trying to look at this from different points of views. Mobb Deep HAS been doing it a long time and all throughout the east coast and new york they ARE considered veterans of this game. Doing it since what...1993 right?? I honestly think that their trying to win brand new fans of the mainstream/commercial rap radio listeners. I think once they have new fans they will blow up and come back with the rawness that they had on the HELL ON EARTH album. We may have to wait until their 3rd album or so from G-unit. But hey, i could be wrong and maybe their just submitting their careers to 50, i dunno. Nonetheless....compared to their earlier releases this album is pure garbage. I agree with one of the kid reviewers that prodigy is trying to sound like 50. I suggest you just download or burn a few songs from this CD instead of buying the whole thing. There are no more than 5 good songs on this album. Oh yeah and the album gets better at the end. Too bad they wasted their songs as radio hit singles. Peace"
5,"I was very lucky to have seen Cat Stevens during the Majikat tour in 1976.  Since then I have always wanted to have a way to recapture the memories of that great concert.  The DVD and this CD of the Majikat tour are perfect!  Outstanding sound quality, great songs passionately performed.  For those who have Cat's CDs, this is a wonderful addition to your collection. For those just getting into Cat's music, a great way to see and hear the ""majik"" of his music.  Outstanding!!!"
1,I wouldn't mind writing a review on Riverdance but as of yet I haven't received it. It was ordered 8-16 and as of 10-22 I have not gotten it yet. Is this normal
5,I once owned this CD and some how lost or misplaced it. My CD player has not been the same without it. I plan to purchase another of it ASA
2,"An album of outtakes and rarities is an odd thing.  Obviously, the songs weren't good enough to make the album they were originally intended for.  Either that or the artist felt they didn't fit right.  So how does one go about grading an album of this type?  It's not easy.  Graded as a stand-alone album on its own merits, I'd give this one a single star.  Marked by inconsistencies and a lack of flow, it's a poor effort that starts out extremely strong and ends gasping for breath.  Graded as a complementary album to ""Illinois,"" however, I'd give it three stars.  I can understand why the songs weren't used and find several of them worth repeated listening.  If i could give half stars, this album would get 1.5 simply because of the overwhelming length.  The respective lengths of ""Illinois"" and ""Michigan"" weren't an issue as the albums both contained an overwhelming amount of good tracks.  A compilation like this of rarities and b-sides would have been better served as a 35-40 minute production rather than the 75-minute opus this package is"
5,"An excellent album. I am a fan of ""I Can Hear The Heart Beating"" and ""Then NOthing Turned Into Somethin"". This cd is entirely different. Yo La Tengo pulls a complete 180, and sticks mainly to covers mixed with some original stuff. It has a misty, thematic feel to it, a certain aura of perfectly arranged acoustic guitar and slippery vocals. ""What Comes Next"" evokes the Byrds, especially their ""Notorious Byrd Bros."" phase. An excellent buy, sit back n enjoy"
5,"Joan Rivers is an American original and this CD captures her at her peak.  Clever, brilliant, brash, outrageous, controversial, Joan was ahead of her time but stays timelessly hilarious on this CD.  If you like Joan, you absolutely must get this - I am so grateful to have found it on Amazon.com!  I originally heard this &quot;album&quot; when it came out in the early '80s and have loved it ever since.  Joan rules!"
5,"Bob Dylan and Daniel Lanois work better together, it seems to me, then many of the other people Dylan has worked with. I certainly like the sound of this record better than the stuff Dylan did with Tom Petty, though I like that stuff too. I actually like this record as much as I like ""Blood on the Tracks"" and often have both of them in my CD changer at the same time (which by the way I never set at random play with a Bob Dylan record, because Dylan records were meant to be played in their entirety, the way Dylan presented them). For me, this record fits nicely between ""Tracks"" and ""Time out of Mind."" Sure he did some great stuff in between, but it's these personal songs like ""What Good Am I?"" that I like so much and, of course, the way Bob Dylan tells a story. There is nobody better"
5,"I really loved this CD.  I am not normally a fan of classical music, but this is more like a pop cd.  Andrea's duets are absolutely fabulous.  You forget you are listening to what is classified as classical.  It is very enjoyable & I suggest all Andrea fans get this one, but they probably already have.  Hopefully with this CD, Andrea's music will be introduced to people who are pop fans & they will start to buy his music & become a fan, as I have"
1,...to the frank passion and energy of her first release.  This is pretentious drivel.  Some call it more mature; I find it nearly unlistenable
5,"Bone's first official release (not counting the rare and hard to find ""B.O.N.E. Enterprise"" album from 92 or 93). Classic, not much more to say, even though it's only 5 songs, they're all classics or damn good songs. With all 5 members on here, Flesh was still around, you get the beginning to one of the best groups ever in rap, and in their prime, as what they did was something new and orioginal and everone loved it. Production is insane, like on E.1999, and mostly handled by the great DJ Uneek, who's beats fit them so well, and some help from Yella. A must have album   #3 - 10 (CLASSIC their first big song -- great beat)  #4 - 9 (tight beat)  #5 - 9.5 (tight beat)  #6 - 8.5  #7 - 10 (CLASSIC -- f/ Eazy E)   KRAYZIE -- Anthony Henderson -- b. 6/3/74 -- Cleveland, OH  BIZZY -- Bryon Anthony McCane -- b. 9/12/76 -- b. Columbus, OH; Cleveland, OH  LAYZIE -- Steven Howse -- b. 9/23/75 -- Cleveland, OH  WISH -- Charles Scruggs -- b. 2/17/75 -- Cleveland, OH  FLESH -- Stanley Vernell Howse -- b. 6/10/73 -- Cleveland, OH   BONE THUGS!!!!!  check all my review"
2,"If you want a good Hank 3 album, go with Lovesick Broke & Driftin'. It's a more impressive and mature work than this one, which seems slapped together and unoriginal.   The best songs on Risin' Outlaw are the three written by Wayne Hancock, who himself has a delivery and style eerily similar to Hank Sr. So what you end up with on this disc is Hank 3 imitating Wayne Hancock imitating Hank Williams, Sr. And since Wayne Hancock is a better singer and songwriter to begin with, and his performances of his own songs are better than Hank 3's, why not just get the original Hancock CDs? The cover of ""Thunderstorms and Neon Signs"" on Risin' Outlaw seems particularly pointless, as Hank 3 uses an identical delivery, launching into falsettos at the same time, holding certain notes the same way, etc. I can understand why someone would want to cover it--it's a beautiful song--but at least add *something* of your own to it. To use an art analogy, it's like Hank 3 is tracing over a drawing that Wayne Hancock made, but it is apparent that Hank 3 isn't as good of an artist.   Having said this, Risin' Outlaw is still better than 99% of the trash played on country radio. But I think that speaks more to the horrible quality of contemporary country music than it does to the quality of this particular album. Still, if you get the chance to see Hank 3 play live, don't miss it"
4,"I was upset to not be able to find any information on Philipa Williams. I love the song ""Look in the mirror"" and was sorry that it was not on the soundtrack. Although the soundtrack was nice I was left hanging looking for more. Where can I find this song?????????????????"
1,"...then so is ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"". Except that's not entirely fair: ""Rocky Horror"" rocks harder"
5,"This is a great album, my favourite.  Let's Go to Tahiti, Friday,Thirteen Days, Don't Cry Sister, Sensitive Kind.  This was made for CD, 15 years to  early.  Okay I like JJ,but this to me is the peak.  And Eric Clapton hasn't  covered a single track of this"
2,"Kasey's foray into the pop genre doesn't really bother me, and she certainly isn't selling-out either.This release however just doesn't have the same quality of songwriting that her three previous country/roots discs had. Not much more to say exept that this, along with Allison Moorer, & Randy Rogers Band are my 3 biggest let-downs of this year"
5,"I have no idea what people are thinking here. This is one of Wendy and Lisa's strongest albums aside from Eroica. Maybe people just aren't into listening to Lisa sing, since she does most of the vocals for this album. However, I am a huge fan of Lisa, and any time I can get the opportunity to hear her sing, I cherish it. I think she has a marvelous and very sweet voice.    Some people have cited their first album was much stronger, but I disagree. The first album was way to &quot;pop-ish&quot; for my tastes, and they hadn't really come into their own yet. It just didn't have the depth of Eroica or Girl Bros. Waterfall was OK, but it has nothing on &quot;I've Got No Strings&quot;, &quot;Bring You Back&quot;, or &quot;I've Got a Big Bowl of Cherries&quot;.    And for the people complaining about Jonathan's death hanging too much over this album, this album was ALL ABOUT Jonathan's death! The whole reason they wrote the thing was part of their grieving process. The album is DEDICATED to him! Get a clue!    To the reviewer ragging on the hidden track: That's deidcated to Trevor Horn, who screwed the girls over when he was producing (or more accurately, supposed to be producing) their album &quot;Friendly Fire&quot;. He put it off for six years and then sucked the life out of it when he finally finished it and gave it back to them, rendering it a completely unplayable piece. (Lisa said it sounded like &quot;an Italian coffee table&quot; after he got through with it.) They didn't just throw that track in to be trendy or something, you know. If you're going to do a review, at least get your history and your facts straight. For the record, I like the hidden track, with its &quot;delta blues&quot; sound, and the lyrics are pretty scathing.     So anyway, don't listen to these other yahoos here saying that GB isn't all that good. They're wrong. Girl bros is a GREAT album. Definitely one of their top ones. Tchad Blake did a great job on production, and the track lineup is varied and engaging. Every song has great depth and excellent melody"

1,"I bought this album determined not to pay attention to any negative reviews from this site or any other. I have never been proven so wrong in my life. This album is inexcusably bad. Ths following review sums it up exactly.  21 of 36 people found the following review helpful:   Deplorable......!, September 20, 2005 Reviewer: Brendan ""Bren"" (New York) - See all my reviews  Whoever is the creative genius behind this miss matched MESS of a tribute should be fired immediately from whatever label or organization commissioned this album. Nostalgia aside, never have I heard such an amazing, talented group of performers (some of them amongst my favourites - Aretha Franklin, Beyonce, Stevie Wonder, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Patti LaBelle, Angie Stone) sound so unprepared, vocally dull, poorly produced and karaoke-like! Talk about the right singers singing the WRONG SONGS and then the wrong singers singing the RIGHT SONGS - who had the GALL to give 'Never too much' to MARY J. BLIGE??? And 'Superstar' to USHER???? USHER????? Of all the incredible R&B singers in existence, including the completely acceptable version by Ruben Studdard, you will give a classic like 'Superstar' to USHER??? Unreal. This whole project just sounds like/ reeks music biz politics to me....my baby Fantasia, Im sorry, this is the worst thing I have ever heard her sing and I think Fantasia is incredible. And what da *!@#!! is that bunch of musical MESSES in between - Celine Dion (mediocre)/ Donna Summer (a remix nightmare) Wyclef Jean (unspeakable) Beyonce & Stevie (boring, and I LOVE those two) Aretha Franklin (a la Divas Live solo - all over the place)/ Babyface (boring) Patti LaBelle (predictable) - oh my goodness. Too much. BARELY saving the album by sheer musicality and good singing - John Legend - truly an original sound - Angie Stone and JAMIE FOXX (would you believe?). Still - not the right songs to really make them shine. What a headache...  And perhaps the most absymal act of wanton disregard - WHERE WAS LUTHER'S FRIEND, BACKGROUND SINGER, PERFORMER EXTRAORDINAIRE AND CONFIDANTE ON THIS PROJECT - LISA FISCHER????? Abysmal I say again.  Suggestion - next Luther Vandross tribute - and Im sure there will be in a year or two - keep some of Luther's friends...but please take some TIME to match the right song with the right singer....and some NEW, INTERESTING voices please...do some research - there are people out there who are amazing, unrecognised or yet unknown talents that would complement any tribute....LEDISI, RACHELLE FERRELL, RAUL MIDON, MELONIE DANIELS, WILL DOWNING, LEELA JAMES, LIZZ WRIGHT and a couple of undiscovered underground R&B/ Jazz gems right here in New York, Abby Dobson, Cole Williams, R'kardo, Gordon Chambers, Lynn Lockamie, Ryan Shaw, Sasha Allen and the list goes on and on....singers who work tirelessly at their craft and consistently give great work...  I am appalled. May Luther rest in peace, and not turn in his grave at this slapdash atrocity that does not give any valid credence to the magnificent body of work this artiste of standard has left to the world - as his legacy."
5,"But I never understood why they didn't catch on. They had a bona fide producer in Kay Gee (Naughty by Nature), incredible vocal chemistry, heavy-duty promotion, and catchy singles. This resulted in an impressive debut. So why the snub? I guess that will always be a mystery. Anywho, along with Blackstreet and Age Ain't Nuthin' But A Number, Pronounced Jah-Nay ranks as one of the top five BEST hip-hop/soul debuts of 1994. And here's why.  It was a very cohesive record, consisting of FIVE R&B entries, with ""Hey Mr. D.J."", ""Groove Thang"", and ""Sending My Love"" making the top five. You think that's the story? NOT!. The story is how good the REST of the album is. In fact, I will say (like other VERY strong debuts) that the album tracks are BETTER than the singles. And that's saying a lot, given there are only a handful of hip-hop/swing albums worthy of such praise in the 1990's. Those tracks are: ""Sweet Taste of Love"", ""Changes"", ""La La La"", ""For A Reason"" and ""Hey Mr. D.J. Remix"". That's eight cuts that should get played everytime it's in the CD player. It doesn't get much better than that.  In sum, Zhane turned out an impressive debut amongst an incredible year of hip-hop soul records. However, their fame didn't last long. They would go on to suffer the dreaded sophomore slump three years later and never release another set. But their debut will never be forgotten. It's hip-hop/soul at its peak when it was still relatively fresh. And that's what makes it irresistibly catchy. A hip-hop fan definitely needs to obtain this one, but a casual listener should as well.  Grade: A"
2,"It had been years since I'd heard this and thought I would add it to my collection, now I know why it has been years since I listened to it, I'll continue with my CCW, Bob Seger, Fleetwood Mac.."

5,"LOS LONELY BOYS, the self-titled album by three twenty something brothers from Texas, is jam packed with indescribably beautiful music that's one part rock & roll, one part country, one part Chicano, one part lullaby and 200 parts stone-cold gorgeous.  Because I'm a big hip hop fan who loves Pavoratti, I don't often find myself in this aisle of the music store. (And by the way what aisle is this?) But a friend gave me this CD and after letting it sit, collecting dust for over a year, I popped it into the stereo on a whim.  What a wonderful surprise.  Almost like love at first hear, I found myself bopping along to literally every tune, as though I had grown on this music.    These guys are amazing singers, musicians and song writers.  Bilingual, they often switch back and forth from English lyrics to Spanish ad libs. Plus it contains two versions of More Than Love, one in English and the other in Spanish -- which reminds the listener of their Texican roots.    Double sided, this CD features 12 songs on one side and 8 videos on the other.  Some are acoustic and reveal just how talented (not to mention charming) this band is.  Because I know so little about country, rock & rock and Mexican-twinged music, it is almost impossible for me to accurately liken this band's sound to anyone else's, but if forced to I'd say Sting.   Not because it sounds like Sting's music, but because it has that same soothing lullaby feel that comforts and convinces you've heard these songs all of your life.  Plus the writing is smart and the rhythms infectious.  -- Regina McMenami"
1,I loved this band. Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy 10 songs? Are you serious. I would never buy this.
1,"they just sound like coldplay all over again. do we really need another coldplay band? they seem talented enough to defy this genre, so i'm wondering why they haven't"
1,One of the worst albums of all time from one of the worst bands of all time. That's all I have to say..
5,"This album is one of the main reasons why I don't buy the argument that everything recorded by Sly Stone after ""Fresh"" isn't worth listening to. I bought this disc with low expectations, but after one listen I was convinced that this album was overlooked. To me, ""High On You"" is like a more upbeat ""There's A Riot Goin' On"". It almost seems like this album had the same production quality with the funk format of heavy bass, keyboards, backup vocalists, and driving beats. The main difference between the two albums is the lyrics: Sly seemed to be in a much better mood when this one was recorded. This disc seems a little looser and jazzier too. The instrumental ""Green Eyed Monster Girl"" is a good example, with a funky keyboard solo that sprawls over the entire four minute track. The liner notes indicate that Sly had a heavy hand in the recording of ""High On You"", stating that he played ""Everything - ?!!"". It makes sense then that this album was credited to him rather than Sly and the Family Stone. However, this album seems to have been dismissed, which is a shame. This may not have been his most memorable work, but this is a damn funky album and I can't find fault with that."
5,"I got this CD as soon as it came out. The song ""Caught Out There"" was catchy and didn't sound like anything I had been hearing on the radio. Kelis intrigued me with her unique vocals and  wild multi-colored hair. I listened to ""Kaleidoscope"" so much that I got sick of it and sold it. Big mistake! I want it back and I can't seem to find it anywhere. ""Kaleidoscope"" is definetly a good R&B album and my favorite songs are ""Caught Out There,"" ""Game Show,"" ""Suspended,"" ""Ghetto Children,"" ""Roller Rink,"" and the Spanish-esque ""I Want Your Love."" This CD also exposed me to The Neptunes and their signature sound, which is well known by now. Overall, this is very good music"
1,"The Kaiser Chiefs are supposed to be the next great thing from the UK. Give me a break! These guys are about as stimulating as a coma. Mundane has apparently become mainstream. I am probably older than your average reviewer, having purchased Jimi Hendrix albums when he was still alive, and gone to Replacement shows in Minneapolis when no one had heard of them but this group does nothing to deserve the praise found in these reviews. I thoroughly enjoy UK rock. I wore out copies of Quadrophenia in high school and love Bloc Party, Franz Ferdinand, and The Music as true progressions and successors to the ranks of Who fans who continue to relish British Pop and Rock. Maybe musicianship is not a criteria to go by but I produce more interesting music on my Mac than these guys can with a full studio of gear. I have never written a review before, but my disapointment in this CD has driven me to this rant! I love this UK revival of sorts and solute you all. Long LIve Rock! Kaiser Chiefs... learn to play those instruments You suck!  For those of you looking to find the excitement you found in the likes of The Jam or the Clash look elsewhere. Maybe the Rakes or Maximo Park will fill the need"
5,"when i looked at this cd on the cd rack, it was only 5 bucks so i bought just for the hell of it. so one day i put in that cd and i was blown away. songs like blackeye, can i borrow some ambition, bath of last resistance, true believers, coming down with me are all great. I LOVE THIS CD. ITS WORTH IT TO BUY IT"
1,"There are 2 good songs on this disc, Stinkfist and Aenema. The rest are pure crap. Half of the tracks aren't even songs, they're just a bunch of noise. No wonder Tool won't put any of thier music on itunes or napster. They want you to buy the whole cd so they can have your $14 for like four real songs and ten tracks of filler crap. If you gave this CD 5 stars there is something wrong with you and you should be beaten severely"
4,"This is a pretty good comp, but it could be a lot better. For one the sellouts(bosstones) shouldn't be on it. A lot of good bands from the warped tour were left out, and this was meant to capture the essence of the tour.  It didn't"
1,"I've listened to the samples of this Cd, and I was proved right. This Cd, along with this groups other Cds were emotionless, has no depth, originality, or meaning. The songs like ""Without You"" are just sickening to listen to. Not only do their voices sound sickening to the point where I want to wretch, but the songs on this Cd are just depressing to the point where you want to kill yourself. The originals were depressing, and so are the new versions of these songs. This is really getting old. Buy something from Joseph Vargo instead. Maybe there is something with originality in it. I'm sorry, but the truth hurts, and we need to face it. Don't buy this Cd, or all of Il Divo's Cds unless you want someone to laugh at you"
5,"The Orb's ""Adventures Beyond The Ultraworld"" was essentially one of if not THE first ambient house album (it at least inspired other artists and (somewhat) popularized the genre - ""Little Fluffy Clouds"" is a very appealing track). It is, admittedly, a little uneven. If you've only heard the song ""Little Fluffy Clouds"", be prepared for a quick change of pace. The rest of the album is very ambient and very experimental, but for ambient fans and the open-minded it's very interesting stuff to listen to. My personal favorites are the first three tracks, and the rest I don't think are as fun to listen to as a whole (they're definitely very good, though). It's not ambient in a traditional sense - there's definitely a beat in most of the songs which help keep them accessible. What's also great is how you're essentially getting two albums for the price of one (actually more like the price of 1.5 albums)! If it weren't for this fact and its influence on the world of music, I probably would've given it a 4.5. Ambient and electronica fans will definitely love it, though. Even if most people won't like the album as a whole, they'll most likely enjoy ""Little Fluffy Clouds"". Highly recommended!  Highlights include: the entire album"
2,"This album was recommended to me by several different sources, including Amazon and my local record store, which had ""mandatory indie classic"" in a sticker on the disc.  I tried it out a couple of times and Mangum's voice just takes away from everything else for me.  I just could not get into this ""experience"" and traded the disc back in.  I agree with the reviewer who says this is not for everybody.  If you can get over the vocals, by all means enjoy this album.  As for me, the vocals were just too much, or maybe not enough"
1,"Okay, so now you're on two hit songs.  Well done, I-20.  But that doesn't mean you should be a hit yourself.  To all the people that went out and bought this, I'm sorry but I really can't see why.  You can be a talented rapper.  Get an interesting voice with lots of expression, put in some good backings and you've got no problems.  But I-20 fails here on both counts.  Does anyone else think that he's got the most annoying voice?  That low drone is just a complete turn off and he doesn't even bother to vary his voice.  Maybe a good beat could have saved him, but there's no salvation here, either.  In fact, the key tracks are the ones where he collaborates with someone else and lets them have the centre of attention, only because we don't have to hear his voice - this makes Backstage & Hey Shawty bearable.  But, really, I-20 should take a good look at himself before he decides to make another album.  Feature on other people's songs, sure, then you can still be a star.  But at least then we won't have to listen to fifty mintues of you"
1,who needs dark side of the moon? wish you were here? the wall? animals?!?!?   just stick with post 83 floy
1,this hippy master of CHEESE made my middle years a living HELL with his horrid M.O.R. sap toons! How can ANYONE actually praise these corntastic AM gold leftovers from an era that had some REAL music  going on? This is like putting AIR SUPPLY over the BEATLES as a GREAT ROCK BAND---wake up America!
4,"When I started listening to Pompougnac I fell in love with the music. Some of my friends told me to start with number 5, I bough 3,4,5,6,and 7 the same day... thank god because number 5 was the one I liked the least... don't get me wrong it is a BEAUTIFUL CD and the songs are great but not the best of them... 6 and 3 are the best for me so I recomend to start with number 6 then 7 and then any of them....I have the whole Hotel Costes collection and it is just amazing. Stephane is a GENIUS..."
1,"Ok, this was the last Jacksons lp and I don't understand why this was their best selling, compared to the gem Destiny and super giant Truimph.  My father bought this in 1984 and did not even get his moneys worth.  This isn't a reunion album at all.  More like a high tech compilation disaster and Jermaine is only included in 1 track and Michael, only in 3.  Although no video availbale, I love the Mick Jagger colab ""State of Shock"" (#3 on billboard and #4 on Hot R&B/Hip Hop Singles) which was a celebrated pop/rock celebration and leading single off of lp.  ""Torture"" was torture and so was the video. Although top 20 hit, it was so horrible that Jermaine and Michael did not join their brothers in the video (although they provided lead vocals) and the later was replaced by a wax dummy.  ""Body"" was good although Marlon can not sing and the instrumental is a remisent to Micahel's ""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'.  Later for the rest of the tracks of the album and being the worst is Randy Jackson's falsetto disaster ""The Hurt.""  This lp (although I do not own the cd version of it) was a huge disaster as well as their ill-fated final tour promoting it."
2,"Twenty years ago, Michael Jackson was recognizably human, and although he was already considered to be slightly eccentric, he was the most beloved pop star on the planet.  And this album, even though it seemed harmless enough at the time, marks the point where things started to fall apart for him.  The infamous Pepsi Lite commercial shoot where he was seriously burned was part of an ad campaign coordinated with this album's release.    It was the last album made by the Jacksons/ Jackson 5, and the only one (so far) with all six brothers on it.  The album was rather hastily put together to fill a contractual obligation.  Michael contributes a couple of songs: the truly horrifying ballad ""Be Not Always"" and the danceable ""State of Shock.""    ""State of Shock"" was a collaboration with Mick Jagger, and it is now best remembered as the finale of the Live Aid concerts in the summer of 1985.  Mick did it as a duet with Tina Turner (and their wardrobe reveals went much better than Justin Timberlake's and Janet Jackson's did at the 2004 Super Bowl.)  And I think I have digressed, but that's OK because the other songs on the album are all done by the (then) less famous and (now) less notorious Jackson brothers.  These are assorted mid-1980s R&B pop numbers, nothing memorably good, nothing memorably bad.  The most enjoyable song, ""Body"" features the most obscure Jackson brother, Marlon, and also features an enjoyably moronic chorus which goes, ""Girl I love your body, so won't you come home with me!"" or words to that effect.  "
2,"Guys...it's not that GOOD. I have the album on my computer, and I gave it a few listens, but...it has no substance. It's not interesting or anything new. It's catchy. And irritating, after more than a song or two. That's all (""Bandages"" is enjoyable once in a while, I will concede).   If you're looking for catchy and poppy (and there's nothing wrong with that), then buy it. If you want something new and original - don't. And if you want good indie dance/electronica-type music go for something like The Faint, The Bravery, or Le Tigre."
2,"This sophomore collection holds no comparison to the more influential Nuggets collections-- Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965-1968; or Nuggets II: Original Artyfacts from the British Empire and Beyond. Those two box sets highlighted some unknown and early punk and pop rock influences and proved as influential as Harry Smith's folk collection. Not so here. I counted about an 1/8th of the songs decent, but have to ask how often will you return to these novelties? Not much"
5,"Please don't be fooled into thinking that Mr. Bucchino writes only ""theater"" music.  His songs are true art songs that can grace a recital stage.  I have included ""Unexpressed"" in my recital repertoire.  Not only is his music well written, but it is far from easy to perform and does indeed require the same attention to detail as any good art song.  This album was a real surprise and a joy to hear some of my favorites performed by other artists - another perspective from which to draw.  Just two words:  BUY IT"
1,"If you like your music reproduced with a synthesizer and 80's production quality, than this cd is for you. Other than that, you have to ask yourself why it was $10 at Walmart as stated by a previous review. (hint: not because it was a hidden gem)I couldn't give this less than a star because of the song selection. That is all this cd has going for it. So read the songs, enjoy it for what it is worth, move along and buy another comp that closely resembles this. (All in that order) Sorry drew, now go back to the drawing board"
4,"Pete Townshend didn't just invent the rock opera, but also the ""mini opera"" when he wrote ""A Quick One While He's Away"", which Pete often referred to in early performances as ""Tommy's Parents"".  Well, Wire and Glass could be ""Tommy's Grandparents"" because this rich song cycle delves deeply into Townshend's familiar semi-autobiographical world which will be instantly recognizable to any Who fan.  From the self-confessional ""They Made My Dreams Come True"" which echoes the Cincinnati tragedy (""people died when I performed"") and the Isle of Wight (""and the band played on until the dawn"") to the powerful Mirror Door which revisits Tommy and the Mirror in so many ways, Wire and Glass proves that while Daltrey's voice may be fading, Pete Townshend is still the best songwriter of his or any other generation.  To be fair, like any Who material, Wire and Glass works best on the stage, so be sure it see it live if and when you have the chance."
5,"Not only was this De La Soul's debut, it's also a landmark, classic album....De La carved out their own unique path in music and created a gem of an album on 3 Feet High and Rising....They presented an almost alternative form of hip hop...One where it was cool to let loose and poke fun at yourself instead of bragging how dope you are....As a result, they were unfairly labled ""hippie's""....  The music on here is top notch...Prince Paul, the groups main producer for their first 3 albums, delivers the goods at a time when sampling laws were much, much more relaxed....They do an amazing job of sampling Steely Dan on ""Eye Know""....Some of my other favorites include 'Potholes in my lawn, Me,myself and I, and the funky collab w/ the Native Tongue Crew (A Tribe Called Quest (actually just Q-Tip) , and the Jungle Brothers) ""Buddy""....  I highly recommend this album for anyone..."
2,"I was super excited when I bought Joann Rosario's first CD ""More, More, More."" Every song on there was gorgeous and inspired worship. I was just as thrilled when I found out she had a new release, ""Now More Than Ever...Worship."" I heard one of her singles, ""God"" and figured I HAD to buy the cd when it came out. But boy was I disappointed when I popped it in my cd player!!! The only stand out tracks are:  Track 3: Thanks Be Unto God Track 6: I Hear You Say Track 13: God The Bonus Track: Cuando Reposo En Ti   All of the other tracks are barely mediocre. It was as if she rushed the making of her cd just to keep her name out in the spotlight. I am extremely upset that I wasted $20 on this piece of junk. I thought some worship music would be on here, since the title of the cd is ""Worship,"" but don't be mislead by this fanciful cover and her pretty face. She should've waited until she had something solid to record instead of making this crappy attempt at music. Joann has indeed hit the dreaded sophomoric slump. I highly doubt that I'd buy anything else she sings. What was Fred Hammond thinking by showcasing her if he knew she was average talent? It's best to burn these songs from someone who already has the cd. The entire cd lacks the anointing. Even the bonus video clip on the installed media player, that features Joann and Donnie McClurkin sucks. All she does is add libs in Spanish, plays some maracas, some castanets and God knows what else and I'm supposed to bust a move to this?! NO WAY!!!   Two thumbs WAY, WAY DOWN!!!  A feeble effort by Joann. This will definitely leave a sour taste in your mouth, as it did mine."
5,"Wire was a blassed anomaly in the punk world, denying all attempts to categorize them as anything but brilliant.  &quot;Artpunk&quot;? nah...  &quot;Progpunk&quot;? nope...  See, nothing works.  Amazing &amp; very influential stuff.  REM &amp; the Minutemen both have publicly praised the genre-bending work of Wire"
2,"The Corrs are good at what they do..Trad-orientated pop, but on this album, I feel that they have lost their way a little. Always difficult to follow a 'Talk On Corners', but this album is just average,at best. There are some nice tracks here like 'All the Love in the World', 'Radio' and 'Breathless' but apart from these, nothing else really rises to the challenge. Lyrical content is amatuerish with this collection and it sounds like an album that was not as lovingly nourished as the others"
2,"Ok, first off, this is the first Corrs release i've listenend to. I'm offering my opinion without knowing anything else they may have done. I've listened to the cd 10 times or so, on random occasions when i need a break from my normal diet of punk and garage rock.  It sounds good. A little TOO good. I agree that it's overproduced, doesn't sound even remotely spontaneous. The studio work is well done, but OVERdone. I'd like to hear something else to see what they REALLY sound like.  The content of the songs is what bothers me. Aside from being sappy, sentimental drivvel (this is pop music, after all - i wasn't expecting anything else), everything sounds like a commercial ditty or a part of a movie soundtrack. Mmm-hmm.  Track 1 - I see a not-so overweight soccermom smiling on a treadmill at Curves(TM), then hopping in the Ford Expedition(TM), and cheering on the kids at their soccer game with a SunnyD(TM) in each hand.  Track 2 - Helicopter pans out as mid-20's girl drives curvy mountain road in VW Cabrio(TM)(R) with top down, thinking about handsome lover... ""LMN""(R) watermark in lower-right corner of screen...  Track 3 - Sad animals. Images of puppys in cages.  Track 4 - Actually, I like this one. Mellow, laid back.  Track 5 - Ugh.  Track 6 - This one is the MOST clever! I see the band members - 3 girls, 1 guy - on one side of a table under a hanging lamp in an otherwise black room, while 3 gentlemen in suits open a breifcase full of money, push it towards them and say, ""As you're aware, the radio has lost it's credibility. The kids are figuring out that there are other bands out there, beside what we pump across the airwaves at them. We need to entice them back. If you want a single, and this pile of cash says you do, then you'll do what you can to save this dying medium. Hell, you work in the word ""radio"" and we'll double what we're giving you."" Come on, the song even SOUNDS like a PSA for the International Radio Marketing Council...  Track 7 - Sounds like a Pepsi commercial.  Track 8 - Ugh. Wait, wasn't this Track 5?  Track 9 - Sappy, but ok. Sounds like they actually put effort into the lyrics. Thumbs up.  Track 10 - Not remotely original, but alright.  Track 11 - Interesting sound. Good beat. Correct me if i'm worng, but was that a semi-Pagan reference there? That would be a bold move, for which i'd applaud them, if in fact it is. Not that i'm Pagan or anything, but hey, its a religiously positive, non-Christian reference that doesn't involve Marilyn Manson, and that takes guts. Especially for radio-loving girls bands.  Track 12 - Laid back. Almost has a jazzy, lounge feel.  Track 13 - Produced by former Ace of Base member? Bubbly, upbeat, not too bad.  Track 14 - Written and produced by Avril Lavigne...  Track 15 - WOW! A RELATIVELY CELTIC-SOUNDING SONG FROM A RELATIVELY CELTIC BAND!! And instrumental, too - big thumbs up! In fact, maybe that's the key.  Whatever. Long-winded, i know, but fair. This album didn't turn me off to the Corrs completely, but i don't have very high hopes now.  Flame away, kiddies."
4,"Am I justified in believing that muscular, meritorious pop music -- the kind we shove our hands toward the volume knob for, the kind that thrills us just to be alive for -- is on the cusp of a major comeback, or do the continuous coronations of [...] we've witnessed so far this year mean that we're all sitting shivah for the good stuff and are too stoned on stupidity to recognize it?  The very same signs that appear encouraging from one angle are horrifying from another.  Look no farther than the terrific Anna Nalick, one of a sad handful of artists hobbled this spring by befuddling single choices (let's just say for now that whoever botched the radio plan for that sterling new Dixie Chicks record deserves a daily caning in the town square until no fewer than one of those babbling loudmouth heifers *is* ready to make nice).  Her gorgeous debut album, Wreck of the Day, got off to an okay start last year riding the coattails of first single ""Breathe (2 a.m.),"" so of course those dolts at Columbia Records went with ""In the Rough"" as a follow-up (why not that magnificent title track?  Or ""Forever Love""?  Or even ""Citadel,"" for cryin' out freakin' loud?!), and of course it tanked.  But then, just like manna straight from the fingertips of God Himself, the geniuses (geniui?) behind TV's gangbusters smash ""Grey's Anatomy"" used ""Breathe"" to underscore the heart-pounding climax of their season's most-watched episode, and Nalick was suddenly back in bid-ness.  Top forty was interested again, and Columbia -- ever eager-to-please -- came up with the bright idea of re-releasing Nalick's album with extra tracks, one of them being -- get this, guys -- a newly-recorded version of ""Wreck of the Day"" that is so balls-out horrendous, you just *know* they're going to make it the third single.  The sorry [...] -- every one of them -- need to be slapped.  Hard"
1,"Everytime i try to listen to jah i just think dam it's time to throw that cd out window and put on dmx, his voice and lyrics sound more like dmx's than pac's plus dmx wips his ass at hiphop. It's like jah is D's kid and when he gets outa line he has to be taught a lyrical lesson by his supiorer"
4,"I haven't had any problems loading or playing this disc on my computer (PC w/ Windows XP Pro). It ripped into iTunes just fine and then transferred to my iPod, where it also plays flawlessly. I have a ton of problems with DRM software on the Warner Brothers CDs (like the new Flaming Lips album, grrr, which Amazon does NOT warn you about), but this disc works just fine for me. Perhaps Norton, Ad-Aware, or Hijack This! are preventing programs from being installed on my computer without permission?  As far as the disc goes: This is the first BRMC disc I've picked up and after five listens, I really like it. It's a laid-back, mostly acoustic disc which in some places reminds me of the Jayhawks or the Eskimos, and in other places reminds me of the O Brother! Where Art Thou? soundtrack. There's even one track (Restless Sinner) that sounds a bit like the Grateful Dead.  There were a lot of songs with religous overtones (pretty much the entire back half of the album, actually), which was surprising at first but not jarring enough to distract the listener too much.   On the whole, this is a nice, peaceful album, relaxxing without being depressing"
2,"Well, I was also disappointed that certain songs were missing on the soundtrack. I do not however think it's fair to say this is a CD only for Blacks because it's all rap! That's ridiculous. But, I'll overlook that naive comment & say, even for those of you who do like hip hop, there were some good hip hop songs there that were missing. I loved that song they played while they were out on the basketball courts playing one-on-one (Let 'em Fight?). That's the song I wanted the soundtrack for & I was so disappointed. As for those of you interested in that Lynyrd Skynyrd song playing during the car chase, it's called, ""Saturday Night Special."" The soundtrack wasn't bad, just a disappointment. To see all of the songs that were played in the movie, visit: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0398165/soundtrack"
1,"This is a minstrel show. Period point blank. These guys set black people back 20 years. Look at them in ""black face"" on the cover of their album. They look like al jolsen twins. Then the music they make is insulting to every race color and creed. Any music that makes you feel dumber when you listen to it should be banned. I'm calling my alderman now to start the movement. LOL"
2,"I'm not into R&B so i'll skip the tracks i'm not interested in. Bought it only for Junior Vasquez Dub which is i must say really bad. Totally boring. I think Junior should release his latest work (Simone Denny - Cliche, Deepa Soul - As I Am)  on CD's instead of letting us buy only his worse mixes. Very unsatisfied"
1,"...and forgotten. Raw and ragged. Cliche-ridden. I consider albums like ""Highway 61 Revisited"", ""Bringing It All Back Home"", ""Blonde on Blonde"", ""Blood on the Tracks"" and hell, even ""The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan"" as worthy of five stars. Sorry, but this is just not in the same class or anywhere near those masterpieces. Those albums are deemed 'classics' for a reason. That said, I'm not at all a fan of the Band or many of Dylan's love songs so please take these things into consideration when contemplating the worth of both this review and this album"
5,I heard Dominic perform two songs from his album on Mike &amp; The Mad Dog and ordered it that day.  I knew he was a good singer having seen him perform on the Sopranos but I was really knocked out by this album. I love his version of O Sole Mio and the song from The Godfather (Parla Piu Piano) but what I really love is the song he wrote Song A Napoletano.  It is the very essence of this CD.  The best part is you'll be serenaded by his voice regardless of whether you understand or speak Italian. A great find
5,"I don't really like the Allman Brothers. I don't like jam music. I don't even like 70s rock. But I love this album. Listening to it in the deadness of an upstate NY winter, it still makes me feel like it's a summer day at the lake with a bunch of friends"
5,"Kate always reminds us of what the best southern music is really about.  In this fusion of southern atmospherics and blues, she touches the heart as few can in shades of country, gospel, folk and pop.    UP IN WEST VIRGINIA IN THE COLD COAL MINES THEY GOT BLUES MILES AND MILES OF BLUES FROM BUFFALO TO BALTIMORE TALK ABOUT HARD TIMES THEY GOT BLUES MILES AND MILES OF BLUES  This may be the best record in her distinguished discography.  Kate's voice, sweet and thick as molasses, is as wonderful as ever and remains center stage with a cast of amazing musicians (including: Walt Aldridge-producer and guitars; Jim Hoke-accordion and harmonica, Larry Franklin-fiddle, Randy Kohrs-dobro, Neil Rosengarden-trumpet, Bill Huber-trombone, Ron de la Vega-cello) and a who's who of harmony singers (Maura O'Connell, Guy Clark, Verlon Thompson, Mac McAnally, and Cindy Walker). Although the blues permeate nearly every song (often in very original ways), Kate finds hope as well.  THE GOOD NEWS IS THERE'S MUSIC TO EASE YOUR WORRIED MIND WHEN YOU GOT BLUES MILES AND MILES OF BLUES AND THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A GUITAR CRYING IN THE NIGHT WHEN YOU GOT BLUES MILES AND MILES OF BLUES  PEACE COMES STEALING SLOW FALLS LIKE SILENT SNOW SWINGS DOWN SWEET AND LOW PEACE COMES STEALING SLO"
5,"Like each colored brush-stroke makes a Van Gogh, this song is a masterpiece in 11 songs"
2,"As much as I loved the movie, I was very disappointed in the CD. I thought this was suppose to be a soundtrack. It is not! The French songs in the movie were lovely, this version is not what I expected"
1,"Wow! This is without a doubt,  THE WORST ORIGINAL CAST RECORDING I HAVE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE!!! Every song is pathetic, thank God there are only 14 of them because if there were any more i would have destroyed this crap! Not even ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" was this bad (And that was really bad). While I was listening I kept waiting for it to get better, to have some whitty lyrics or a good melody or somthing, ANYTHING, but nothing changed it just kept getting worse.  This crap includes the songs: This Side of The Tracks --1/10 One Step Closer --4/10 The Buck Stops Here --5/10 It Doesn't Take a Genius --5/10 Owner of my Heart --5/10 The Great American Tv Show --2/10 Flushed Down The Pipes --5/10 Storm's A-Brewin'--5/10 Road Kill --5/10 But He's Mine/It's Never Easy --3/10 That's Why I Love My Man --4/10 Panic --5/10 Finale --1/10 This Side of the Tracks (Reprise) --1/10  When I bought this album I thought it was going to be another Bat Boy, but boy was I wrong! Don't buy this disaster of an album you will be sorry if you do!   P.S The little lines before the numbers are minuses"
5,"The main reason in this review is to express my amazement and disbelief in several individuals reviews discrediting C. Wilson for his cover of ""Let's Chill"".  This whole album is banging, and for you young cats, here's a little history:   ""Let's Chill"" was released by GUY in `90/'91, (of course everybody knows Teddy Riley's name - if not, come on now, you need to educate yourself on one of the top 5 producers of all time...). Who in GUY sang ""Lets Chill""? Aaron Hall. Who was Aaron Hall's inspiration? Matter of fact - who was Aaron Halls ENTIRE vocal style based on? Who did Aaron Hall himself admit to admiring growing up and mimicking his style? CHARLIE WILSON. It's even been quoted that ""...even his vocal distinction is strangely similar to that of Charlie Wilson, a member of the R&B/Funk group The Gap Band"".  If you are a rookie, please listen to the old GAP BAND albums, and you will see who Aaron Hall sounds exactly like - lead singer Charlie Wilson. I actually give more props to Charlie Wilson for STILL being able to continue to release albums and make hits, while Aaron Hall seems to still be in that black hole of nowhere for quite a few years.  Moving forward, with the new ""Lets Chill"" remake, Charlie is really just putting it down just like GUY did, except with the same style that Aaron Hall bit off of him.  Man, maybe it's just me, but I think a lot of people putting reviews on here really don't really know their music.."
1,"76:14, Remotion, Pentamouous Metamorphosis...THOSE are Global Communication albums. This is pure drivel comprised mostly of (C)rap and trendy house music that has been remixed. My biggest complaint is that I didnt buy this CD to fill my house with the shameful vulgarities that normally accompany (c)rap music (and I use the term ""music"" here very generously) and that appear here in a few of the ""songs"". I bought this CD because the title of the group on this album is GLOBAL COMMUNICATION, not Gun Master Nig*er Bit*h F*!ker!!!   There is NOTHING here that resembles the music that Global Communication has released under the name GLOBAL COMMUNICATION in the past! Knowing that Mark Pritchard and Tom Middleton release music under other names makes me wonder why they didnt do so in this case? I dont expect the same old stuff from them (I was hoping that they actually had something new and interesting to COMMUNICATE) but packaging this GARBAGE into a CD released under the name GLOBAL COMMUNICATION is like packaging porn into a movie entitled  DISNEY'S BAMBI RETURNS....It just isnt right and quite frankly, is SUPER OFFENSIVE.   TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY for anyone expecting to hear Global Communication do something worthy of recording. Through ALL their releases (even the ones under other names) this is the most shameful, vulgar and deviod of anything remotely worthy of musical attention, thought or reflection"
1,"I could give a long winded review on how bad this album is, but let me just say this... Radiohead is one of the few bands that I fell for all the hype about.  What an idiot I was, I bought this cd and listened to it about 20 times trying to figure out what it was that I was missing.  I finally came to the conclusion that the masses are indeed stupid if this is supposed to be the new alternative or cutting edge or whatever.  The song creep is probably one of the worst rock songs of all time and the rest of the album is totally unmemorable.  Garbage folks that is all this amounts to.  The most overated band of all time perhaps? Oh by the way before everybody gets mad and assumes I didn't give any of their other so-called experimental releases a chance, let me say... it ahas all been done before.  You just have to dig a little deeper than MTV and Rolling Stone magazine to find it.  Don't believe the hype!"
1,"Faith Hill has been known (both celebrated and criticized) for testing the waters.  She has never ""played it safe""...until now.  First of all, this disc seems like a poor defense and/or apology for ""Cry"".  ""Cry"" was a great album.  It may not have been commercially successful, but it was a very personal album.  Amy Grant also had this issue.  ""Lead Me On"", though not her most commercially successful, was her most intimate and personal album.  Kudos for baring your soul.  This is the function of an artist.  As for ""Fireflies"", most of the music and song selection seems geared at making sure Faith Hill gets played on country radio.  Still wounded from being eaten alive by critics who disliked ""Cry"", Faith has decided to duck back into the 'safety zone' and win back her conservative country audience.    The only problem I have with that is that Faith Hill shines best when she pushes the envelope; when she goes out on a limb and tries something distinctive that stands out.  Nothing on this CD stand out.  If the songwriting is at all great, (as with the title track, Stealing Kisses, and If You Ask) the vocals fall short of emotional depth.    I understand that Faith is a lot older now, and she has to compete with vocal powerhouses like Carrie Underwood, and songwriting geniuses like Miranda Lambert, but it seems gone are the days of ""This Kiss"" and ""Breathe"".  However... Faith Hill is facing a double dose of dilemnas: ""Fireflies"" is not selling as well as ""Breathe"" and ""Faith"" did, and more importantly, her country audience still isn't quite impressed with the ""I-dyed-my-hair-and-hillbilly'd-up-for-you"" image that Faith has unveiled"
5,"Loreena's voice on this and every album is amazing - so perfectly suited to Celtic music. The first song I ever heard her sing was ""The Lady of Shalott"" (played on public radio in NC).  I had to stop the car and close my eyes!  Buy this album and every other album of hers - I'd be VERY surprised if you were the slightest bit disappointed"
1,I am at a loss to hear what people appreciate about this CD.  We were barely able to make it through one listening.  This is a classic example of a CD that NEVER would have been produced had the artist (using the term very loosely) not already been famous for something besides music.  The lack of talent and originality on this CD is apalling.  It only gets a star because that's the lowest rating.  I want my money back
2,"Strengths:handful of decent tracks, talent is present, cd has clean sounding guitars, vocals and bass drums, every now and then it almost gets exciting...for a few seconds  Weaknesses: they don't seem to know how to change their sound at all, almost no creativity, music is boring and not energetic at all, most tracks are long and exhausting to listen to, could have been much better than what it is    I'm surprised who P.U. is categorized with. Noone else thinks they sound a tad bit akin to TOOL?  I could be wrong...all I've heard from TOOL in forever is their radio stuff, but this sounds alot more TOOL-ish to me than, oh say, Taproot-ish or Endo-ish.  Hard 'n Heavy bass chords, clearly distinctive guitar rhythms and pounding bass drums, that sound just like TOOL. Vocals have that high pitch sound thats too one keyed and too soft for me. All songs seem to run at virtually one pace..SLOW. The music gets boring.   I can't hear where they've broken any real ground or added anything cool, catchy, or different.  I'm just not digging this disc as much as I think I should be.     With a cheap boombox you're likely to miss alot of the low end that makes the music strong and enticing.  So without good speakers, the music sounds even more wimpy and even more boring than with a good surround system. "
4,"In terms of nu-metal, this is definitely one of the best albums in this genre in a long time - if not ever. This is far from generic, as some of the other reviewers has blatantly stated, although some of the songs do sound run-of-the-mill and dry in places. Overall, though, this album is full of creative melodies and structures that you just don't find now-a-days in the 'nu-metal' scene. Don't settle for the garbage that's out there, this is a talented band with a unique sound [those guitars!] and a great album.  If you're into nu-metal but are starved for creativity and originality, pick this album up. It's not perfect, but it delivers."
1,"Wow, they actually put this ""anti-classic"" on CD.  Seriously, this is a very bad album.  Practically none of the ""superstars"" can sing, other than Jimmy Hart, and they are mostly stuck with dumb novelty songs.  Not that they fare too well when they sing ""serious"" songs.  Nikolai Volkoff has a decent baritone voice, but his thick accent renders ""Cara Mia"" unintelligible.  Probably the worst singing here is by Roddy Piper, although Captain Lou Albano gives him a run for the money.  If you are a fan of bad celebrity singing, you should get this album"
5,"This is an amazing collection of ALL NEW works from not only a master guitarist and stellar songwriter...but one of the smoothest and most amazing voices around (for another voice this good...see ""Neil Finn"").  Even if you've never heard of Vince Gill, or don't listen to country music - buy this cd and enjoy it (each cd is in a different style).  I just saw him last night at the Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles and he blew my mind.  He and his roughly 20 piece band were sensational.  He performed 5 or 6 tracks off each of the four cds in this collection and not one of them wasn't fantastic.  There aren't enough good things to say about this box set of all new material"
1,All of the songs except for ONE are TRASH on this one. Not worth forking over even $.01 for this one!!!
1,"this pile of crap, like all poser efforts, was created to make money.  after the 91/92 punk revolution via grunge, tons of bands jumped on the bandwagon to cash in. after realizing they had lost much of their fanbase during this period, gnr decided to try to gain some street cred by covering some old alternative songs and a golden oldie, but by doing so they proved just how little musical ability they had.  all the songs they covered were played in the exact format as the original with the exact same instrumental accompinament.  the old boys from la did nothing new and nothing creative.  but i do have to give them credit for one thing they did right, saying in the liner notes to pick up the original records, how true"
1,"Back in 1993 I was a kid that really loved Guns N' Roses. They were the best rock band in the world, so I decided to blindly buy this album, and to my surprise....it sucked big time. I don't like Guns N' Roses much now because I now understand their sometimes stupid and racists lyrics. However, this album compared to Appetite, lies and U.Y.I. 1 and 2 deserves a -5 stars. If this album would have been recorded by any other band it would sucked too and it would not have sold more than 2000 or 3000 copies.  My advice, if you like GNR you will find that all their previous albums are just wonderful, but please, don't buy this crap. The cover image says it all it looks like a s... and 99% of this album songs are s..."
5,"Intriguing historical account of MacNamara- what he was thinking, what he did not say during two administrations involved in the Viet Name war.  Use of film footage and Philip Glass' eerie and ominous soundtrack further developed the power of this film"
1,How come the songs sounded better in the movie. Some of the best songs from the movie were left out of this soundtrac
1,I dont see what people like about this CD. My 14 month old son and I looked at each other in disgust when I first played it!!! Very irritaing CD dont buy it!!! I am returning it today.
5,I remember that I had the Lifetime on cassette 20 years ago and never grew tired of it. I have always been a big Holdsworth fan and he really shines on this stuff. The second half of the cd I had not heard before and was disapointed that it had taken me so long to discover these tracks. Fantastic stuff  A must if you are a fan of either Tony Williams or Alan Holdswort
4,This is a nice CD and should provide hours of listening enjoyment.   I had been waiting for this CD to come out and I an not in the least bit disappointed
5,"Having gotten his magic songwriting touch back with Freedom, Neil finds the mystic of his avalanching guitar sound with Ragged Glory.  The album is awesome and fits perfectly alongside Neil's best work with the Horse"
1,"Wow, I never thought I would've found an R&B album worse than Omarion's debut until I finished listening to this album's samples on Amazon. ""Naked"", Marques Houston's spohomore effort, is undoubtedly the worst R&B album I have ever heard in a long while.  I apoligize for sounding harsh, but think about it. Where's the talent? Where's the skill? What about the heart & soul? Where's the musical ambition? What about meaningful lyrics & nice beats? Where's his dignity? Where's hist artistic growth? I'm betting he threw all that & so much more out the window along with his tacky clothes. Marques, take this into account...YOU'RE NOT USHER AND YOU NEVER WILL BE, SO STOP TRYING!  I honestly tried really hard to force myself to like his song ""All Because Of You"", but I just couldn't convince myself to do it. There's not a single song on this entire album that has any true emotional depth. His other singles, ""Naked"" & ""Sex Wit You"" are absolutely pathetic attempts at explicit sexuality, with egomaniacle, ridicuously retarded videos to boot. As if the cheesy, sexual come-ons & emotionally devoid ballads were hard enough to bare, you have miserable club tunes to complain about here & there.  Marques Houston is a perfect example of why R&B goes downhills nowadays. Anybody with a slight fraction of a brain would be aware that he has no talent, and relies on his ugly mug & flabby gut to seek the attention of ditsy tween girls worldwide. Skip this album at ALL COSTS (AND I MEAN THAT LITERALLY)"
1,"i loved marques houston in immature/imx.  his first solo cd was good.  he's a decent actor as well.  this cd, however, does not match up AT ALL with other stuff he's done.  all because of u and naked were good songs (and naked was a good video ;) )  i think there was one other good song - but, i sold this cd to a used cd store about 2 weeks after i got it.  i couldnt even listen to most of the songs all the way through.  boring.  vulgar language.  mh is just trying too hard by using the n-word a lot and talking dirty.  sex music can be classy - but not on his cd.  i was soooooooooooooooo disappointed with this piece of crap cd.  do NOT buy it!!!! "
5,I am a huge 80s fan and this is a terrific selection of some of the best songs from that time
5,"During the 80s, the Bangles solidified themselves not only as one of the best girl groups, but one of the best groups overall.  This CD contains an anthology of their greatest hits and will take you back in time to the 80s.  Led by Susanna Hoffs' melodic vocals, Michael Steele's bass, Vicki Peterson's guitar, and Debbi Peterson's drums, the Bangles created a collection of songs that have stood the test of time and still remain popular today.  This CD is loaded with great songs, including ""Going Down to Liverpool"", the classic ""Manic Monday"", ""If She Knew What She Wants"", the #1 ""Walk Like an Egyptian"", ""Hazy Shade of Winter"" from the movie ""Less Than Zero"", the upbeat ""In Your Room"", and another #1 ""Eternal Flame""  This greatest hits CD is the perfect collection for the person who doesn't want to go out and buy each individual album.  All of the best songs are contained in this great single CD.  I highly recommend this great disc.  Listen to this CD and hear one of the best girl groups from the 80s"
1,"How can you not relate to Ludacris's music? It deals with every day life like chilin in da hood and slapin da bitchis an hos. It's so deep. I can identify with his music so much it's scary. i sure hope one day I can become a musical genious like him. Forget about no-name bands like Pink Floyd, Yes, and Radiohead, they're never played on MTV so saying that they're talented is like saying Ashlee Simpson didn't create rock n' roll! Ludacris-the most talented musician on the planet-is going to change the world!!!                                                                                                           If you took any of that seriously, this album is for you"
1,Tipsy and Hood Hop were decent but the rest of this crap is flat out horrible. This was one of the worst rap albums of last year and hopefully this dumbass won't make another album or will step his game up. XXX wasn't bad but this dude still is a horrible rapper and I don't recommend buying this trash at all. If you want a good mix of party and gangsta songs get 50 Cent's Massacre album instead or even Ja Rule's R.U.L.E. Those aren't classics but they are much better than this garbage
5,"The title says it all.  Just throw all the tracks in a hat, and pick out a hit.  So much emotion was drawn to each track you can feel it.  For myself, this album represents tons of memories and great times.  I suggest it to any and everybody"
5,"Great performance by Rex, absolutely unreproducible! L&L's impeccable collaboration is one great pre-Soundheim work."
2,"This is not necessarily an indictment of Aimee Mann or holiday music....though I do find such disks as being cheesey. I was a bit surprised when I heard Mann was coming out w/a holiday album.  It seemed a bit above someone who has based a career on not only  original material, but non-mainstream music.    It has also always surprised me that at the plethora of holiday disks that are out there and how many more come out each year.  Is it just me - or are there only 18 holiday songs in existance to begin with?  There is only so many different ways to cover ""I'll Be Home for Christmas"", ""Winter Wonderland"" - all of which I believe are covered by James Taylor, Sarah McLachlan and Better Midler, all of which were released this month.  I'm guessing they are cheap to produce and easy to pull in profits.  That being said - I still like Mann's voice and she comes through with 3-4 songs that are above the fray.  ""Whatever Happened to Christmas"", ""Christmastime"" and her original ""Calling on Mary"".  I also liked the fact that she covered ""You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch"".  That seems to suit her more.  Not my cup of tea - but the songs I mentioned are the reason the disk gets 2 stars"
1,"this review is pretty funny you have to admit..... ""This band has the most retarded lyrics I've ever heard - ""Sometimes the sun goes down, sometimes it goes back up, I'm wondering which one you are watching now."" Huh?? Forget about the singer's gross melodramatic voice or the band's boring decision to steal riffs from the Strokes - just check out those lyrics!! The sun doesn't 'sometimes' go up and down, it ALWAYS goes up and down - ALWAYS - you morons. ""I'm wondering which one you are watching now."" Which one? Excuse me, last time I checked, we have only ONE sun, not two. Whatever. Maybe these hipsters should've spent more time in school and less time working on their hair. Their first record was trying to sound like Weezer and now they're trying to sound like Hot Hot Heat. How lame is that? And why are these guys trying so hard to look like the Strokes? They even have that token dude with the caucasion 'fro. I was suckered into seeing these guys at Spaceland last month and overheard the singer ""pep-talking"" his band. So embarassing. ""Okay, guys, have fun tonight but make it look natural. You never know who might be in the audience. And don't forget, those fat girls in the front row bought some merch so pretend to be nice to them and we'll make fun of them later."" Cool guys."" "
4,"This album has it all: *actual* country music, a couple of rockers and humour (Aviator).  The music that's on here puts mainstream country radio to shame.  See Shooter live if you get a chance.  You won't be disappointed"
5,"I keep seeing all over the reviews that this is intended for kids.  I am 40 and the owner of a studio.  I have been involved in music production since 1985 and I have got to say that the music this duo is putting out is phenomenal.  Not only is the music fantastic, but the production is flawless.  My daughter watches Disney channel which is where I was first exposed to Aly and AJ's music.  I was blown away when I first heard ""Rush"" and when ""Chemicals React"" came out, I was convinced that ""Rush"" wasn't a fluke and decided to buy the CD/DVD.    With the exception of the two cover tunes at the end of the CD, this disk is awesome.  Don't get me wrong, they have done a great job on the cover tunes, I just don't know why they put the covers on it; their stuff blows the covers away.  This CD is definitely not one with just a couple of good songs; they are all good. I'd recommend this CD for anyone who likes modern rock. "
4,"The cd includes versions of &quot;All or Nothing&quot; and &quot;Dov'and L'amore&quot;. The &quot;All or Nothing&quot; remixes are fantastic, specially 'Almighty Definite Mix'.  All &quot;Dov'e l'amore&quot; versions are great, with a special attention to 'Tony Moran's Anthem Mix' and 'Ray Roc's Latin Soul Vocal Mix', turning this new single one of her bests.  The beautiful cover follows the same style of the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; collection and the show in Las Vegas, available in VHS and DVD, a must have!"
4,"Jeff Lang gives a fresh and personal voice to the blues.  Another reviewer complains that he isn't Son House or Robert Johnson and so forth.  Yeah, this is what... 60 years later?  A blues fan for many years, I get tired of guys that can't look beyond their dusty old records and nostalgia for an era that they didn't live in and perhaps didn't quite exist.  Son House is fine, but he had limited musical talent.  Jeff is not only technically talented, he brings a fresh personal message into a style that has too long suffered from a lack of innovation"

1,"For my version of this album, O.G. means old guy. For my opinion, he is not a very good rapper. He should retire pernamently"
5,"This is simply one of the loveliest albums you will ever hope to hear.  Tracyanne Campbell and her band mates in Camera Obscura have labored under the shadow of their fellow Glasgow musicians Belle and Sebastian.  It doesn't help that like Belle and Sebastian their songs are more softly edged and lyrical than most other rock bands.  But although there is a superficial resemblance between the two bands, especially when Imogen Campbell takes the vocals instead of Murdoch, there are also significant differences.  Campbell is a far more delicate songwriter than Stuart Murdoch and her compositions are far more delicate.  She lacks his brilliant quirkiness and astonishing gift for melody, though her songs frequently feature very fine melodies.  But Murdoch is probably the finest melodist in music today, so the comparison is unfair to her.  On the other hand, most of Campbell's lyrics express emotions that I can relate to far more easily than Murdoch's.  He may be the greater artist, but she lives pretty much where I do.  Camera Obscura turned out two very good albums before this one, but this is easily their best effort yet.  All of the songs are consistently excellent and Campbell's lovely voice graces everyone.  She is a remarkably subtle singer, very gifted in her phrasing and expression.  But as fine as she is as a singer, she is better as a songwriter.  I like a lot of the cuts on this disc, in particular ""I Need All the Friends I Can Get"" and the truly sad ""Dory Previn,"" about the young Mia Farrow breaking up her and Andre Previn's marriage.  But my favorite cut by far is the extraordinary ""Lloyd, I'm Ready to Be Heartbroken,"" named for one of Lloyd Cole's best songs on his classic album RATTLESNAKES, ""Are You Ready to Be Heartbroken?""  All in all, this is one of my favorite albums of the year so far.  I think it will appeal strongly to anyone who loves Belle and Sebastian, but also to people who are drawn to Mazzy Star.  The album possesses much of the same wistfulness and longing found on their albums.  Basically, if you love wonderfully subtle and magnificently fragile music, this is going to win your heart"
1,"It was, and remains, one singular sensation. A Chorus Line changed the face of American musical theater, with an urbane book by Nick Dante and James Kirkwood and sophisticated yet obvious lyrics and music by Ed Kleban and Marvin Hamlisch. The Pulitzer prize-winning musical has been resurrected in Broadway and on CD . . . And we can't wonder why. Those familiar with the original cast recording will cringe at the flatness of the ""new"" recording, a recording that's simultaneously intrusive on the memory and superfluous in any collection. Is this what Baayork Lee did for love"
1,"when the man sings, he sounds like he is blowing through an off key microphone.  The songs and lyrics are all so terribly written and sung, If you can call that singing at all"
5,"This is a great collection of hits.  It's great to be able to buy these cds where you like every song on the cd and not just one -- that's why I but the collections of hits, but then you can't go wrong with Alan Jackson"
1,"let's just get this out of the way now. maysa? i'm on your team babes, but this cd just hasn't done it for me. i got your 1st cd & was hooked. i waited for the next & was floored! not in a good way! the cd jacket was so drab & tired, just like damn near every song inside the case. i let it sit on my shelf & decided to give it a listen again. still i didn't feel it. it's in my car right now & i still can't get through it all. i'm still on your team though. i have your latest & i play it 2 death. over & over. cd's 1 & 3 are both must haves. but this 1 stinks"
5,"I think this album is stunning and fantastic! i have recently been getting into Kates music...first i got Hounds of love and was immediatly sucked in i loved it and still do,what an album! Then i got The kick inside which i also immediatly liked but it lacked a little something not sure what that somehting is? i then got never for ever, wow so diffrent and hypnotic and growed on me so much every time i listened, and then this. Abit upset and put off but some other reviews i had set my mind to get this so thats what i did, definately NOT dissapointed! so what if its more in the times and a bit over produced and maybe lacking some of the crazness??? its such a good good album! still has amazing melodies, craaaaazy lyrics and its fun (even though some of the subject matter isnt, kate was struggling at the time) rubberband girl,moments of pleasure,song of solomen,lilly,top of the world and why should i love you are highlights for me but my fave song is the amazing and unbelieveably touching ""and so is love"" as soona s that song had finished for the first time for me i was like""WOW"".....seriously give ALL of Kate a chance, im getting ""the dreaming"" this weekend and I KNOW im in for an amzing challenge, but i also know i will love that too! The red shoes doesnt deserve bad reviews just because its not people BEST kate album"
2,"Ni se molesten en comprar esta basura, no sirve, nada que ver, El problema es el siguiente aunque ya sabemos que el quiere cantar pop en vez de salsa no es la primera vez que lo hace y a tenido mucho exito con los otros cds anteriores pero este desde que comienza la lirica de las canciones como que no riman, el ritmo tampoco ayuda, el disco anterior si que era un disco tenia salsa y pop como este. El anterior le da 20 patas a este,al parecer el cambio los arreglistas si me gusta como una o dos canciones es mucho ( boricua siempre sere y sobre tu piel) tanta espera para nada.........."
1,"Seriously you dont need me to tell you wack this album is, if you've ever heard it you'll know yourself the depths that this album plummets to.  I'll be honest, I heard Thug Lovin on the radio and thought it was O.K, all the other singles though, Mesmerize etc.. were s**t.  A friend of mine offered to burn me a copy, free of charge, and i thought fine, what's the worst that could happen, I was mistaken, I would compare listening to this with torture.  If your into sing along pop songs, with a little bad language for good measure, you may like this album.  To put this in the hip-hop genre is misleading, Ja actually attempts to 'sing' half the songs on here, and when he's not singing he does his best Tupac impression.  Thankfully at the time of writing this, his career appears to be over, if we can rid the hip-hop world of Nelly and 50 Cent as well, the world would be much better  for it.  Avoid any albums by this phoney.  Message to the honorable, agreed most of the rappers listed are s**t, but Ja destroying Snoop, Eazy-E, Mack 10 and DMX, don't talk s**t, this diva couldn't touch any of them.  After writing this I noticed someone was selling this album on Amazon for 1 cent, that should tell you all you need to know about it"
4,"first of all, I should state that I am the number one Steely Dan fan in the world and yeah I know, this is a Fagen work. when I first listened to this CD I was unimpressed.  same old same old.  But listen again (and again) and it will grow on you.  it will remind you of the days when you said to yourself ""this band is *$%#@ good - i'm glad so-and-so (kathy) turned me on to them"".  favorite track is ""mary shut the garden door"" - not because of the lyrics but because of the jazz.  "
1,Very dissapointing. Too many wildlife creature noises. If I had wanted to hear birds singing in the rain and other animal noises I would have looked for a title that matched my request. I wanted to hear rain and thunder only.
2,"This Cd I feel is too long. I can't stand Foreigner anymore, they used to be great. Awful edits like Urgent, Jukebox Hero, & Waiting for a Girl Like You have to be changed. And that boring ballad, what is it?????? I Want to Know What Love Is....Irritating for 2 minutes. And that singer, he kind of raises his voice too much. Not one of the best bands I have ever heard. Other irritating songs are HEADKNOCKER, Blue Morning, & Head games and they kinda suck. They just give me on my nerves. This is noise.....buy any album from Dire Straits insted. Dire Straits are the best....................................."
4,"'Magical Mystery Tour' is the most uneven of all the Beatles' albums.  The familiar songs are magnificent, but while some of the originals are poor, they are always interesting.  The American record company did a cut-and-paste on all of the Beatles' albums up to 'Sgt. Pepper', and, while it was to their great detriment, their intervention here was a masterstroke.  Because EP's (extended plays, records with five to seven songs, like a half-album) are part and parcel of the UK and not the U.S., this c.d. contains a jackpot of the Beatles' accomplished singles of '67.  Without them there wouldn't be a full album as we know it. Significantly, it was the only time the British record company later complied to the US format.  To start, the title track is a fun, carnival anthem.  It is looser and less serious than 'Sgt. Pepper'.  Then, Paul, subjectively matches himself with the perceptive and beautiful ""Fool on the Hill,"" with its admonitions from yet another memorable character, meant to look at the conventional world differently at the expense of alienation.  However, it is John's ""I am the Walrus"" that pours out surreal imagery (yet borrows a few references from Lewis Carroll) that is the album's highlight.  From there the original songs are interesting, but substandard.  ""Flying"" makes an interesting instrumental with vocals added without any discernible words, but it seems more like an exercise than a good song.  Much in this vein, ""Your Mother Should Know,"" is a shadow of Paul's best vaudevillian efforts, including ""When I'm Sixty Four"" and ""Honey Pie"".  The echoing vocal effects don't do anything to contribute to the song, either.  Also, George contributes what may be his poorest Beatles' song, ""Blue Jay Way"".  While it is understandable that spiritual awakening is the heart of all major religions, this song is done with unremarkable lyrics and sung with effects that make it sound like he's a deep sea diver accompanied by drowzy cello patterns.  The remarkable second half almost needs no elaboration.  ""Hello/Goodbye"" heralds the second half with one of their catchiest songs.  ""Penny Lane"" and ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" made what many believe to be one of the best singles ever.  The former is glorious and the latter is Lennon at his philosophical best.  ""All You Need Is Love"" may seem somewhat dated, but it needs a revival (and not just in credit card commercials!)  It is still a remarkable and entertaining anthem and subjectively one of the Beatles' very best songs.  ""Baby You're a Rich Man,"" the song's B-side is no throw-away, either.  Clever and funny, like Lennon, it is a catchy and mesmerizing piece.  Song for song, 'Magical Mystery Tour' is still essential.  It represents their most uneven effort, but retains some of their best music. Either way it always remains interesting.      "
5,"Game on, this is good stuff!  To be honest, I wanted to like Ray's first solo Stag a lot more than I did, which is why I walked, not ran to Prom,   But then that was before I caught the Indigo Girls last summer, where Ray and her mandolin wowed the crowd with the anthem Let It Ring.  It was the first time I'd heard it and it made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.    The theme throughout is pretty obvious, it's called Prom, after all.  But it's also pretty obvious that you didn't have to grow up queer in small town rural America to feel like a freak. The sentiments of adolescent angst and isolation are universal, after all.  But beyond waxing poetic about adolescence, there are some great cuts offering stories of love's trainwrecks and dissatisfaction with the music industry, as well.  This album is less gritty than Stag and the sound is a lot more refreshing and graceful than you might expect.  This outing is to Ray as All That We Let In is to Indigo Girls.  The album showcases the elements we've come to expect from Ray and the Indigo Girls: unflinchingly honest lyrics coupled with uncompromising musicianship.  Those are rare commodities in today's music industry.  Unleash your inner awkward teenage/freak/geek self and enjoy the Prom."
1,"My sister got this CD, and at first I didn't care. Until I heard the Beatles covers. I was absolutely horrified at what they did to those classic songs. The people who make these are the spawn of idiocy.  If those kids ruin another great song I'll hunt them down and throttle them in their sleep"
2,"don't get me wrong, there's some great stuff here: Behind Blue Eyes, Substitute, Bargain, Won't gGet Fooled Again, Baba O'Reilly, a few others.  But if the Who are going to be in the co. of the all time greats, there shouldn't be any filler on a 2 disk set anthology.  They're the most overrated band in rock history. tried to be rockin' and rollin' rock and roll while at the same time putting a lot of effort into concept albums, didn't get the mix right.  Pink Floyd mastered the concept album 'per se', David Bowie gave us the concept album that really wasn't (rise & fall of zig strdst & spdrs frm mrs), while tommy, 4ophenia, and the one that was aborted (I forget the working title)fall short, somewhere in between. Just as the Who fall short, somewhere in between the Beatles, Stones and Led Zep. Daltrey as a great frontman? gimme a break; not worthy of shining the shoes of Jagger or Plant, not even Ozzy (in his prime with Sabbath) or Ian Gillan (Deep Purple). He doesn't even sing on some of their most famous songs, and he didn't write any of them (to go by the liner notes that came with this disc, anyway).  Many of their songs are described as quirky. 'silly' is closer to the mark. How 'bout just 'dumb'?  The Stones declared that 'time was on their side' and marched defiantly in the face of all obstacles, including time itself . The Who promised that they would die before they got old, on the other hand, and failed to deliver. This was my last attempt to 'get into' a band that I USED TO feel guilty for never having 'gotten into"
1,"I, like many others, wanted to like this CD, but was really disappointed. A lot of work obviously went into the creation of this. They have an interesting sound at first that quickly gets predictable.  I thought the first song was decent enough, but after that the CD spirals downward fast. The main problem, as many reviewers have noted, is the singers voice, which is often hard to hear. But if I had a voice like his, I'd probably want it towards the back of the sound mix.   The most original thing about this CD was the liner notes/lyrics, which are presented in the form of a funeral program. Get it? Cool, huh?"
5,"Death Cab For Cutie's follow up to their 1999 debut Something About Airplanes continues to build on their ethereal, atmospheric, unique, indie pop-rock sound.  We Have The Facts is a more experimental, dynamic, rock album that still retains the previous album's sentimentality.  This is the album that transformed them into experimental indie rockers, but didn't launch them into the mainstream.  This is a pure work of art, technically the band uses the chords in a very abstract and sparse way, the percussion is slow, and contemplating.  Some songs break out of that pattern and demonstrate a more full bodied, but not yet developed sound.  Most of the album relies on the musical  production.  Ben Gibbard's voice is as haunting and beautiful as it ever was.  He is given the perfect backdrop which complement his voice well.  These songs work so well because of their minimalism.  This album has a great sophistication to it, there is nothing else like it.  The structures of the songs aren't traditional, so they seem refreshingly new and never get tiresome.  Each song is sequenced so that it works well against the last song, and the songwriting captures the emotional depth of the music perfectly.  Lyrically, the songs focus on loss and relationships.  Company Calls Epilogue is about a wedding gone sour, while 405 is about relationship.  The wavy guitar melodies are catchy and loosen up the sometimes slow pace of the songs.  This is an album that gradually builds on you after a couple listens.  It's not over the top, and requires multiple listens to capture the depth of the music.  As a whole, the album works incredibly well, it's cohesive and consistent.  These songs have been crafted carefully and are painfully addictive once you begin to appreciate their sophistication.  This is indie rock at it's finest.  The production takes this album up to new great heights.  This album is similar to The Forbidden Love EP, which is also good.  In my opinion, We Have The Facts, and The Photo Album demonstrate Death Cab's early raw style, where everything was understated simply and beautifully, before the overproduced Transatlanticism and Plans.  This is a great album to listen to if you want to relax, or just think.  As they continue to develop as artists, it's amazing to watch their sound change, for better or for worse.  Recommended.    "
1,"Cassie is a beautiful young girl who used to model and been discovered by Mottola and been taken under Diddy wings.This cd has good beats and thats all i can say cuz thats all Im hearing .Her voice is very weak and low ,sounds as she s whispering and she absolutely cannot perform live.This is Not Quality Music.I would not reccomend this cd"
5,"This album is mostly lyrical songs, but not in a bad way. This is a good album for fans of the lyrical songs of the series. The styles on this OST range from blues-rock to cowboy western to metal to sugary-sweet pop to medieval music. The range between all the vocalists is very vast and very welcome.  ""American Money"": Is the bounty hunter t.v. show's theme, very western with it's banjo and gunshots. ""Don't Bother None"": An awesome blues-rock song sung by the gruff Mai Yamane. Here voice is rough and raw and perfectly fit for this kind of song. ""Live in Baghdad"": The random metal song in the mix, with surf guitar. I love this song exactly for it's randomness in the series. ""Cats on Mars"": A super-cute song! This is the absolute cutest song of the series. It's poppy, it's cute, it's fun. Hard to resist. ""Green Bird"": A sweet vocal by Gabriela Robin, her voice is so gentle and nice. ""Elm"": A song that sounds like a medieval ballad from a skilled guitarist. It's so beautiful and addictive, the vocals are perfectly harmonized and the skill of the guitarist is very impressive"
4,"The quintet, which forms My Morning Jacket, hail from Louisville Ky. The lead singer and band's leader/founder has the unlikely name Jim James. I have to assume that since Jim is the shortened version for James, making his formal name James James, that his mother was drunk when she named him. J.J. founded the band in the late nineties with his cousin, guitarist John John. Gotcha! Just kidding. Cuzz's name was John Quaid. Cuzz along with keyboardist Danny Cash, found the touring too much of a grind and left the band after the release of their third album. In addition to J.J. their current lineup consists of: Two-tone Tommy on Bass, Patrick Hallahan on Drums. Late joiners Bo Koster (keyboards) and Carl Broemel (guitar) replaced Quaid and Cash.  Z  My first impression of `Z' was that it was quite a bit different than my typical choice for aural enjoyment. My second impression was that it was not something for which I would lay down fifteen bucks. My last and continuing impression was that there was, indeed some worthwhile enjoyable music emanating from my CD player.  Trying to categorize the band's music is challenging. I word have to say the overall the band play's an indie sounding pop-rock with forays into progressive, folk and alternative, even psychedelia. Their music tends to be happy and poppy with a lot of variation between songs. The album starts off with a song named ""Wordless,"" which actually reminds me of the song ""Angel"" from the Romeo and Juliet soundtrack but with a mild cha cha style beat. It's probably because of J.J.'s strong singing on the song but for me the similarities are strong. ""It Beats 4 U"" White Stripes beginning doesn't impress me, but picks up in the middle with J.J.'s reverberated vocals, a cello, some whistling, finishing somewhat psychedelic. Track three, ""Gideon,"" has some interesting moments with J.J. sounding like he's singing through a tunnel yet his vocal remain strong. The song has some noticeably good keyboards and the tempo builds ending in a crescendo.  ""What a Wonderful Man,"" is a short mulligan stew style song featuring tavern kind of vocals and a tinny guitar."" Track five is ""Off the Record."" I didn't particularly like the beginning but about a third of the way through it becomes a fabulous bluesy, psychedelic instrumental. ""In the Woods"" starts out with a circus Hammond which recurs throughout augmenting an um pah pah circus beat. The seventh song is ""Anytime,"" probably the rockingest if not the catchiest song on the album.  The next song at just over six minutes is the penultimate longest song. Other than some really good piano parts, that seems to be the most memorable part of ""Lay Low."" The ninth track, ""Knot come loose,"" is a forgettable ballad but the last song ""Dondante is an eight minute masterpiece, by far the best and most refreshing song on the album."" Beginning inauspiciously with J.J. singing to a slow casual beat and subtle guitar, the song heats up after a slow start, immediately after a nice guitar solo into an explosion of sound, featuring J.J.'s soaring vocals and a whining guitar, ala post rock style, before gradually fading out to obscurity.  Conclusion  I don't think I'd plunk down fifteen bucks for ""Z"" because even though it's a pretty good album, I would seldom if ever be in the mood for this confluence of eclectically influenced music, especially since I tend to gravitate to the heavier variety of music. However, I cannot help but feel that it would appeal to a large segment of the music buying public. Are you one of them?  Final rating 4 stars."
2,"I saw this on a ""best of 2005"" list and I have to say I am disappointed. The musicality of this record is not too bad. It's not terribly creative, but it is enjoyable. What really turned me off was the incredibly vapid and thoughtless lyrics. Unfortunately this is just another pop record, of which there are way too many these days. The only track on here that I would give a second listen too is seagull. I wouldn't recommend the rest of the album"
2,"I traded my girlfriend my Nickelback CD for Joss Stone. Now I kinda wished I had kept my Nickelback CD. She hates the Nickelback CD and I hate the Joss Stone CD, but she also hates the Joss Stone CD. If I kinda liked the Nickelback CD better I would of kept it because I kinda knew I wasn't going to be into the Joss Stone CD. But I just kind of figured the Joss Stone CD would be a little bit better than the Nickelback CD and my girlfriend was completely thinking that the Nickelback CD was gonna be a LOT better than the Joss Stone CD, but man was she let down completely. And for as much as I really don't want the Nickelback CD back at this point I just assume let her keep it and I'll get by with the Joss Stone CD. I mean I guess what I am trying to say is that I sorta liked the Nickleback CD in the beginning, but once my girlfriend said she hated it I figured I got the better end of the bargain by trading her for the Joss Stone CD which at first seemed like a much better CD to have than Nickelback. I think my girlfriend wants to trade back again and if we do then I guess I just have to live with the Nickelback CD, but I'll prolly never play it again if she gives it back to me. BLEH!!  Matthew"
5,"Well, I am amazed that at 64 or 65 years old Ron Isley is still making incredible music.  However, some of the lyrics are explicit.  This CD would be great for a honeymoon.  The CD should have a sticker on it entitled, ""SERIOUSLY, FOR ADULTS WHO WANT TO CONCEIVE CHILDREN!""  But I guess that's why the CD is entitled, ""Baby Making Music."
2,"My wife bought this for me.  I was really looking forward to listening, but I found it a painful experience.  I not sure if it is the song choices, the production values, the arrangements or a combination, but the album overall is just a huge disappointment.  No songs from it have made it on to my Ipod"
1,"To be quite honest, I don't understand how anyone could consider this trash to be music. It is just a bunch of noise. I could do what these guys do with a bunch of 13-14 year old amatuer drum, guitar, and bass players in my garage. There is little to no rhythm to their music, and the vocals, quite frankly, are horrible. I can't even tell one song apart from another.  Grindcore just makes Metal look bad. The only Grindcore bands I actually do enjoy are Pig Destroyer and Agoraphobic Nosebleed. Go listen to some of their stuff if you want good Grindcore. Ed Gein is just talentless garbage. Don't bother with The Tony Danza Tap Dance Extravaganza either"
5,"I listen to this CD at least twice a week.  Definitely worth every penny and then some.  My faves are: I wanna be your lover, Do me, baby, delirious, I would die 4 U, If I was your girlfriend, Kiss, Sexy M.F., Gett Off, Cream, and of course, purple rain.  Highly recommended"
5,ok its true TTR dosent have the best singer but he can write good songs.If u find the lyrics they are very touching.These guys are now working on a full lenght and eating up the local/indie scene. The best tracks are Talk Radio and Plans To Wake Up On The Beach. Strong buy if you like punk/emo
5,"Energy=Hot Hot Heat! this album is full of it, though not just in the album as well as on the stage these four performers pour their hearts out to you and sweat as the play their instruments. With catchy melodies thougout the album, though fast that you have to look at the lyrics to see what exactly he says, you'll be sure to enjoy this alternative' dance album that makes any kid that thinks he/she is to cool to dance, Dance!!, that is all Hot Hot Heat makes you want to dance, besides that, they also have other songs like ""elevator"" and ""jingle jangle"" to tone down the album. This whole album comes from all of the emotions of a gone band member, but newly found one, being a great addition, and being in love. So to dance and sing get this album."
1,"i dont know why people like broken social scene, they are boring boring boring. i listned to this entire album and it was difficult. i wanted to turn it off really bad, but i had to go through it all to prove to myself that it is not good for anyone. for real though people, there is tons of music outthere that is not boring. you should check it out"
5,"When it comes to ""pop,"" people are use to hearing the crap played on the popular radio stations. Brittany Spears, and terribly horrid music like that. I want people to know the true meaning of ""pop"" music. Here it is in the dictionary:  ""a bland watered-down version of rock'n'roll with more rhythm and harmony and an emphasis on romantic love""  Now, before anyone bashes me, I don't agree with the ""bland"" and ""watered-down"" words, expecially in the case of Stephin Merrit, but it's true of the music played today. There's magic in this album. It's so full of life, and dare I say, the bliss of happiness. It's truly amazing how ""Wasps' Nests"" can completely change my perceptions. It puts me in a state of mind. Maybe I'm just a hopeless romantic, but this album happens to be the soundtrack to my life, as cheesy as that sounds. And no matter how cheesy the lyrics may be, You'll find yourself in love with them, almost as much as the luscious sound that is, ""The 6ths."" A masterpiece"
5,"Keane is one of the greatest bands of all time. The fact that they use piano/keyboards/bass/drums on every song, with no guitars at all, shows that they are more musically sophisticated than all the other mindless guitar rock that's out there. There are more than enough guitar-based bands. ""Somewhere Only We Know"" is the best song of all time. Beautiful lyrics, solid piano backbone, and a steady, moderate tempo, make it a brilliant album-opener. The album has upbeat pop/rock, like ""Bend and Break"" and ""This is the Last Time,"" slow, sorrowful ballads, like ""She Has No Time"" and ""We Might as Well be Strangers,"" gentle, peaceful melodies, like ""Sunshine,"" and slightly ethereal, unearthly ones like ""Untitled 1"" and ""Bedshaped."" Plus, all the lyrics are intensely personal and honest, ones that everyone can relate to, in one way or another. All together, the album is a classic, one that (if the American public knows anything about music) will live on to be known as one of the greatest albums ever made. Every song is a masterpiece. There are no fillers."
2,"I absolutely loved that song ""Carry On Wayward Son"" which sounds like one of the greatest stuff in history. Rest of the other songs on this album are not that good. 2-stars"
2,"Contrary to the previous review, I find that commenting on the quality of the mixing on this cd to be essential.  It has to be the sloppiest 'exhibition' of professional mixing that I've heard consigned to disc.  It just sounded like there was too much emphasis on getting as many tracks on in 70 mins, regardless of flow, or beat matching.  Very let down by this disc"
1,"The charming 1977 musical is not the subject of this note.  The show is great and the liner notes are superb. However, consumers should note that there is a critical flaw in the mastering (at least on the disc version that I obtained). It is very unfortunate that the manufacturers did not pull this mis-mastered version from the market. As noted elsewhere (and absolutely correct), an entire track of sound is lost and can only be heard distantly in the background.   If the problem is corrected and later discs are OK, it just compounds the problem with no way to know if you have a flawed disc or an OK disc. A most unfortunate problem for what should be a joyous recording"
5,"This is a great album.  It is perfect for doing chores at home, driving in the car or plugging away in the cubicle.  I took a chance on this ablum because I enjoyed ""pins"" and ""maps"" from fever to tell and I am glad I did.  ""Golden Lion"", ""Way Out"" and ""Cheated Hearts"" are my favorites. "
5,How to decribe this gem of a CD. There is such a gentle warm feeling to the songs. It appears that Steve Kilbey's voice is aging like a fine wine.  Great selection of songs with a sprinkling of five new ones.  I have always tried to get friends and coworkers to like the Church and this one is getting the warmest response. Any fan of the Church will enjoy and it is a great place to start for the curious
5,"Houston is doing it big.  Slim thug,Pall Wall, Chamillionare and Mike Jones.  All There albums are great.  But Slim thugs sticks out due to the neptunes.Like A Boss wouldn't have the same attitude if the neptunes hadnt made the beat. 1.Like A Boss 2.Click Clack 3.3 Kings 4.Already Platinum 5.I aint heard of that"
2,"Bland, bland, and more bland.  It seemed to be trying for some kind of emotional resonance, and fell far short of the mark.  With the except on the main character's mother, nearly every single character was completely unlikeable.  And a little Lea Delaria goes a long, long way.  It does replicate the 80s very well, but it just feels so devoid of humanity"
2,"Don't get me wrong. I'm a raging hippie, who's completely anti-war. And the lyrics on this album are great, and I love the cover of ""Imagine"" by John Lennon. But it seems that the actual desire to make good *music* fell to the back burner on this one. It's not that the songs are bad per se, but they're all fillers. It's an entire album of fillers, with no really great songs to bring them up. Overall, a disappointment, which is unfortunate, since the wonderful message is lost by the lack of lustre in the music.   If you're new to A Perfect Circle, pick one of the other albums. If you're a veteran, sure, pick it up. But I'd suggest listening to it on random with your other A Perfect Circle and Tool cd's"
5,"When Kylie released the single ""Spinning Around""...that's what it...Kylie was popular again...the difficult songs were history. It was time for new sex & dance Kylie. The single went number 1 in UK and it was a real success all over the world. The second single ""On a Night Like This"" went number 2 in UK and also ""Kids"" (a classic song made with Robbie Williams) went number 2. The album wen through the roof annd it was Kylie's time for her greatest success ever. Even the beginning of her carriere where she sang ""I Should Be So Lucky"" and ""The Loco-Motion"" can't be compared this time. There was released one more single in UK ""Please Stay"" which also went to top ten. ""Your Disco Needs You"" is so fresh and powerful that it is one my favourites from this album...the chorus is excellent...it's wonderful when Kylie uses a choir. ""Bittersweet Goodbye"" is a peaceful and sad song...Kylie's voice is very sad. Other songs are more like party songs and that's why this is recommended for everybody who wants to dance...or likes good music. By the way, what does ""I'm Under the Influence of Love"" means? I have an idea for that.  Stars: Spinning Around, On a Night Like This, Your Disco Needs You, Please Stay, Kid"
5,"I've just gotten hip to the Hotel Costes series by Stephane Pompougnac (so I'm 4 years behind with this review--please, bare with me!)...I'm one of those people who don't want to be left outta the loop when it comes to stuff--at any rate, I started buying this series outta order...I bought #5 first, #4 was too latin for me to purchase, #1 too expensive, and #3 was unavailable...soo, I decided on &quot;La Suite&quot; because of the unfamiliarity of the songs and artists on it. Well, some of them anyway. The ubiquitous &quot;Jazz Music&quot; by De-Phazz almost made me not buy this set, but I said, what the hell? It won't be the first time I bought a mix/comp CD with songs I've already seen or heard a million times already. How does that work anyway? What? Certain record labels/ mixers all bid on the same songs or something? ahem...As usual,I digress.  All that notwithstanding, &quot;La Suite&quot; was an entertaining delight and voyage into chill-house, as I so aptly pen music such as that remixed by Pompougnac. This whole series is tempting me to go ahead and buy 1, 3 and 4 no matter the cost.  Hey--I'm the type of music buyer who likes to own all volumes in a series, what can I say? Anyway, getting back to the review of &quot;La Suite&quot;, it's not as good as #5 (or from what I could sample on #1 in Borders), but it does have some stellar moments with the opening &quot;To Ulrike M.&quot; by Doris Days with a Zero 7 remix?? OK, Pompougnac, what gives? I thought these were supposed to be songs mixed by you?  Other stand out tracks are from 45 Dip (Check these guys out on the &quot;Acid Lounge in Space&quot; Comp CD), Sympatique (Now, this is true Parisian music despite it's &quot;cheesiness&quot; as one reviewer stated), Mo'Horizons (nice, as always), Palais Mascotte (strong dance floor appeal), I:Cube (hypnotic with a 60s feel), Pascal w/Mister Day (nice disco-track), Mr. Scruff (the song says it all), Boozoo Bajou (nocturanal) and Streetlife (cinematic and groovy, baby). This is a worthy investment for any Chill/House music fan.  The songs on Costes &quot;La Suite&quot; are refreshing and upbeat from beginning to end. Sure to impress even your most stiff-necked guests at your next get-together--you know the ones, they stand on the wall all night long with their half empty bottles of Corona trying desperately to look cool"
5,"If you're a fan of regular book musicals, this one is not for you!!! Passion is an operetta style love triangle that is complex, poignant, and beautiful. Stephen Sondheim's brillaint score ties the entrie musical together, which again helps him keep his genius status. The clever weaving of songs, scenes, and, most interestingly, letters, make for a great cast album.  As for performances, it's the females who own this show. Marin Mazzie is as glorious as ever as Clara (she's even better in Ragtime), and Tony-winner Donna Murphy brings all of the emotion forward in her portrayal of Fosca.  For those who are used to the usual Sondheim, this one may dissapoint. Others, however, will love this opera of love"
1,"Generally harmless, except for one very offensive song about siblings that hate each other and hate their parents.  The song is probably funny to ultra-sophisticated, cynical adults.  But the song is totally inappropriate for a four year old.  I wouldn't bring this CD into your house"
5,"Chamber Music seems so right during the boisterous mechanics of the holidays and one sure respite from the garish noise of the external season can be found in works like the Mendelssohn Piano Trios.  Here Eugene Istomin, Leonard Rose, Isaac Stern perform Piano Trios 1 and 2 in a manner that bespeaks camaraderie of the performers as well as a complete respect for these luminous works.  Some have called these works piano sonatas with obbligato and while for this listener that is an unfair judgment, Eugene Istomin plays the piano part with enough flair and thoughtful propulsion that he does at times sound the more important.  But that is Mendelssohn's writing and not a self-aggrandizement of a pianist.  The overall sound is simply superb. These two trios are some of the loveliest ever written from that era and the gentlemen performing them offer sophisticated and informed interpretations. The recording is excellent, the music is rarefied!  Highly recommended. Grady Harp, December 05"
1,"First of all what kind of name is Nelly? It sounds about as bad-ass as the Bee Gee's. And although Nelly isn't as bad as Chingy or Feminem, he isn't much of an improvement either. The lyrics are stupid, and often ridiculous (uh, 'Hot in Herre' anyone?), and he would go as far as rapping about sneakers, in that horrible excuse of a rap 'Air Force Ones'. 'Pimp Juice' has to be the worst song I've ever heard, well, next to 'The Real Slim Shady' by Butterfinger, er, Eminem. Nelly looks like a freakin' gorrila! And that stupid bandaide doesn't help him too much either. If I had to pick the five worst rappers in history they would be as follows: 5. Ludacris 4. Fat Joe 3. Nelly 2. Chingy 1. Eminem Nelly at 3...it doesn't take a genius to figure out that buying this is a bad decision. Jesus! Nelly makes 50 Cent look like Eazy E"
2,"I've been a huge fan of the Isleys for over 30 years, and stuck by them through the early Motown soul and their golden groove-funk period of the 1970s, through to the later stuff right up to the excellent Mission To Please album. But that's when they should have dumped R. Kelly, because it's the last album that had any really decent hook to it. And when you have a blistering guitarist like Ernie Isley, why bury him so far in the mix that his licks sound like they're being played through cotton wool?    R. Kelly's plodding grooves just grind from one indistinguishable track to another, which is pretty much the case on the even more disappointing follow-up to this, Body Kiss. The only track that kicks any ass here is the opener, Move Your Body, which fools you into thinking this might be a return to former glories for our heroes. Sadly, the leaden funk of R. Kelly then comes crashing in like a tidal wave of sludge and we get a whole turgid mess of leaden walking-pace 'grooves' that might sound all right in the background when you're getting it on with the partner of your dreams, but as listening music just gets you all exasperated and reaching for the 3+3 album again.    Come on, Isleys, dump the Kelly glop and get back to what you can do best"
2,"I had never heard Leonard Cohen's music but saw references to it frequently when looking at other singers/songwriters.  Given his status/reputation I thought I should get this CD and learn what all the fuss was about.  Having had no preconceptions, I have to say I was quite disappointed.  I think the music has not aged well and is pretty unremarkable.  Perhaps the style liberated others to pursue new directions but the work in and of itself is ho hum at best.  Specific example that speaks volumes:  listen to Cohen's singing of his ""Hallelujah"" and then listen to Jeff Buckley's cover of that song on ""Grace"" which was recorded in 1994.  Sorry, Leonard, you cannot hold even a birthday-sized candle to Jeff Buckley's rendition of your own song.  It is a very unflattering comparison that pretty much put the first and last nail in the coffin for my appreciation of Cohen's legacy.  ""Tant pis, vers le bonheur."
2,"My first exposure to Leonard Cohen was hearing Allison Crowe singing ""Hallelujah."" I was awestruck so I decided to get the Essential Leonard Cohen. Bad decision! The man barely breaks out of a monotone and sounds like he's terrified that someone will hear him above the accompaniment.  He's another artist who should continue writing but let others perform his works"
5,"There's no point in repeating what others here have said.  Had it not been for a chance perusal of the review in Rolling Stone, I never would have known about this CD.  It is a great, joyful rock album - I never even listened to the Dolls in years gone by - but this one nails the spirit of the genre.  I've worked backstage at Stones, AC/DC and Dead shows, and I modestly suggest that I know the real thing when I hear it.  Tear the shrink wrap off, baby, and crank this one up on the way home with the windows down, while the weather is still warm enough to do so!  If you're a guitarist, pay attention to what Syl is playing, and watch the video - he's really learned to do it right"
5,"Hey, what's up? This is my first review. At first I didn't feel it was necessary; Paul's Boutique already has five stars, and deserves every one of them. Still, the quality of this record compelled me to express my thoughts on it, too.  This album is near perfect. The only track I feel is weak (and it's not even that bad) is Egg Man. I didn't dig it at first... but it grew on me, so I'll give it a listen, now, especially for the sampling (as mentioned by another reviewer).  Every single track on the album is linked. I think this adds alot to it, because it's like a non-stop track. Very enjoyable. If you're looking for a great hip-hop album or want to get into the Beastie Boys, definitely cop this album. Solid Gold Hits isn't great, and the anthology isn't worth it. All Beastie Boys albums pale in comparison to this sucker. Get Paul's Boutique"
1,"I bought this CD because it got a lot of good reviews, and the description sounded like something I would enjoy. However, it turned out to be an atrocious CD. It is very repetitive and monotonous throughout. The songs pretty much all sound the same. There's little melodic variation, and the vocals have basically no range. The lyrics are extremely uninspired. I'm glad I bought this used at a cheap price. I don't know if I'm going to give it away or just throw it away; it's that bad."
1,"And what's the deal with the CD cover? Anyway..I have always found her voice to be too breathy,too mannered,and trying too hard to be sexy.I just do not like her singing.I tried.I couldn't get into it.Give me Ella or June or Sarah.Now that's singing.Sorry Krall fans"
5,"I was introduced to Sissel through a recent trip to Norway.  She has a voice of an Angel!  Through buying this CD, which I listen to in the car on the way to and from work, for a relaxing mood, I have been introduced to her other CD's.  Wish they were more available in the USA.  I really enjoy this album"
1,I saw on the internet a picture of chingy rapping on stage and a notorious porn transvestite with HIS hand on chingy's crotch. Now I knew chingy couldn't rap his way out of a wet paper bag but I never questioned his manhood. Now that I saw the picture and read the article about Chingy and his transvestite lover I am so done with him. I hope the reviews he gets encourages him to find another occupation. This album is classic garbage and would be a perfect coaster for the next party you have at your house
5,"I bought this CD because I loved the song NOTHING CATCHES JESUS BY SURPRISE!  Then I found that this CD is packed full of HITS.  It is nice to hear so many of his songs played on the radio, not just one or two from this CD.  It shows the quality of work that goes into the CD and it reflects in his singing"
1,"Having been born in '86, I unfortunately did not yet exist to experience the late '70's punk movement or was too young to be part of the '80's hardcore years. Instead, I got to grow up with the MTV generation.... how so very lucky I am. Yet, I figured out the difference between real music and the junk mainstream media keeps referring to as ""punk"". So, if I could figure it out, any other idiot from this forsaken generation shouldn't have any problems. Good Charlotte is okay if you're 8 years old, but if you're 13 and you're still listening them you need to just grow up and listen to much better stuff. If you're my age and you listen to Good Charlotte then you are beyond any help.  Instead of Good Charlotte, buy or steal the real thing: Subhumans:Time Flies + Rats. It was the first one I picked up and it led to an entire collection of real, gritty, raw punk music. To all the Good Charlotte fans, take the advice I just gave you. Go from whining about how much your life sucks to actually doing something about it."
4,Very good movie - fantastic lead dancer.  Music is good but a mix and not all danceable.  All in all good movie & good soundtrack. 
1,"Everybody seems to think this band is innovative or something. They sound exactly like 'Beard of Stars' era T-rex. Well, almost, because AC does a lot more layering with tons of effects. What are they hiding? The lyrics?  Anyway, if you're going to rip people off, you should give props. Shame on Animal Collective"
5,"This is one of the greatest hip hop albums I've ever listened to. In my opinion, Murs has never sounded so good. His flows are vivid and realistic and the production fitted them to the Tee. I thought every song was extremely dope. I highly recommend this in your collection. I know this review will not make me popular w/many but I have to write it how I honestly feel. Save the negative remarks for someone who cares. I know Murs is not the best MC of all time. I'm not sayin that. He's far from it. I'm sayin this is my 2nd favorite album of all time simply for the overall feelings I get from it every time I put it on. I'm sure if you want some heart-felt/feel-good Hip Hop music this will suit you. Peac"
1,"Alright, I will state that I was curious about this band about four years ago. I thought to myself: ""Good Charlotte can't be that bad if they have so many 'hardcore' fans that go everywhere, buy everything and speak anything that is to do with Good Charlotte."" Man, was I wrong. Good Charlotte sucks. They're basically a boy band that wears black clothes and wears eyeliner. Their music sounds like sped up emo music. You could describe their music as ""emo with estrogen"". MTV markets them to the teenybopper crowd. How so many young, impressionable kids can get suckered hook, line, and sinker into ANY of the garbage that this pathetic excuse of a band dumps onto them is beyond me. They definitely appeal to 12 year old kids, who have such a horrible life because they can't go to the mall and buy new clothes or get a new video game.  They are a whiny band that love to sing about how ""horrible"" and ""tragic"" their life is, meanwhile they are sitting in cash in their mansions. No one cares except for their legions of self-pitying fans who feel they can truly connect with GC's ""deep"" and ""inspiring"" so-called ""music"". They even have whiny ballads that sound like the rest of the ""pop-punk"" and ""emo"" genres at the moment. Yeah, GC is fuelled by teen angst and armed with extremely bad talent. I'm sorry kiddies but Good Charlotte is nothing more than pop. I'm 16 & I'm already getting tired of the new music because it is getting horrible & more horrible. It's a manufactured popularity contest now. With their mediocre cliched song lyrics, Good Charlotte are 100% worshipped by their demographic, pre-teen and teenage preppy girls (and flamer guys.) This group of pop icons do nothing more than create crappy music (which is charged to audiences at well over $50 per ticket) and find themselves on MTV acting like jackasses every chance they aquire for the pleasure of their braindead viewers.  Their fanbase consists of 12 year olds that think they know all about music, therefore claim that they have the right to say that ""GC"" are musical gods or are the ""best punk rawk band eva!111!1!"", while talented bands like The Beatles and Pink Floyd to them are ""old"" and ""horrible"". These 12 year olds can usually be found online, usually on message boards, with usernames like ""XxGCIsDaBestPunkBandEvarxX"" and ""trU3_pUnk_raWk3r"".  Conversations between members of their fan base may be similar to this:  Poser: I love Good Charlotte they're so punk they're so much cooler than all those other pop bands. Kid #2: Where did you hear them first? Poser: TRL, oh, and in Hot Topic.  Poser: Hey, wanna, like, go to a Good Charlotte concert next month? Poser 2: Yeah! And we can wear our studded bracelets and red and black pants that we bought at Hot Topic!  Teenybopper talking to herself: ""Oh my gaaaawd. I hate my liiiife. I can relate to these guys sooooo much because nobody listens to me and everyone hates meee""  Ugh.  In the end, I recommend the following punk rock albums to those who have been victimized by Good Charlotte:  Raw Power - Iggy and the Stooges Ramones - The Ramones London Calling - The Clas"
5,"In my opinion, John Cage's In A Landscape is THE most beautiful peice for piano of absolute all time.  Never has there been a classical peice for this instrument that truely got to me personally than this.  And never will there ever be.  In A Landscape goes beyond 'music' and is an entity in itself that speaks on many levels.  It's so simple and yet is so powerful.  This is a must for any music lover or/and a person who would like to get to know the many works of John Cage"
5,"No importa lo que haga, no importa lo que cante, el es el mejor.  Yo no tengo que escuchar un disco de el para comprarlo, el solo hecho de que sea el es suficiente para mi.  Me gusto el disco y me encanto su nuevo look"
4,"For some Born in the USA is the greatest the Boss ever delivered, for others it's the start of a steady decline. Often mistaken for an overly patriotic statement this album found Bruce suddenly among the ranks of eighties superstars as Prince, Madonna and Michael Jackson. Born in the USA is the reason why some place the Boss in the same category as Jon Bon Jovi, Born in the USA sounds as a stadium blow-out. Yet lyrics as ""Born down in a dead man's town, The first kick I took was when I hit the ground, You end up like a dog that's been beat too much, Till you spend half your life just covering up"" could hardly be called patriotic or shallow.  Born in the USA was the follow-up for Nebraska, a sparse demo-like recording. A lot of the material here was culled from those sessions and had the E-Street bravura added to them. The title track was originally a one-man rockabilly outing but transformed in E-Street synth-rock. The same treatment songs as Dancing in the Dark, Glory Days or I'm on Fire got. It's that treatment that's ultimately the weakness of the record. Today Born in the USA sounds hopelessly dated at times. The listener is forced to listen beyond the production for its depth and meaning. At the time of its release it was no different. A lot of the lyrics meanings tend to get lost in the poppy production that made it so successful. It is also one of Springsteen least cohesive efforts. The styles on the album range from pop to rockabilly, from stadium rock to folk. For those who take the effort to dig deeper into the record there is a wealth in the songs that is rarely matched by other artists.  As never before Springsteen paints a picture of those of us who fail to be a part of the American Dream. There is the obvious post-Vietnam protest song of the title track, not allowing us to forget, and its attack on Reaganism. But there is more. In I'm on Fire the character bears his soul as Bruce sings, ""At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet, and a freight train running through the, middle of my head, Only you can cool my desire"". Sex being the means through which the character forgets his angst for just a moment. Similar sentiments are found in Dancing in the Dark, Bruce's ultimate pop effort. ""Man I'm just tired and bored with myself"" screams the character, ""Hey there baby, I could use just a little help"", hardly a light and upbeat lyric. The people in Springsteen's songs seem to be stuck in their lives, unable to get ahead. The chances the American Dream offers us are accessible only to just some of us. The rest are left behind ""just sitting back trying to recapture, a little of the glory of, well time slips away and leaves you with nothing mister but, boring stories of glory days"""
5,"They've inducted that Macolm Mclaren money-making hype ""punk"" band the Sex Pistols into the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame (McLaren's other great creation was Bow Wow Wow) who arrived two years after the CBGB thing in New York in '74 (Brit kids seeing the Ramones on tour was far more influential on the punk scene there than anything the pistols did). Those laughable geezers Black Sabbath have been inducted (though they had their moments in their early albums). Even Billy Joel is an inductee (thanks to the evil & damned for eternity Jann Wenner)!! But neither the Stooges nor Iggy are to be found listed; their first album came out in 1969, which would have made them elegible in 1994; 12 years of tripe. A lot of people need to get a lot of hate mail for this omission. Then again, perhaps NOT being in the R'nR hall of fame is the last sign of integrity as this genre of music truly dies a slow, ugly, painful death (see ""alternative"" music since the early '90's leading to the likes of Avril Levine or . . . or any other ""serious"", ""sensitive"" ""hip"" whiney, over-hyped, worthless bands these days). "
2,"Some of us have been through years where the Beastie Boys were always playing in at least one of the tape decks in our dual tape players (that's cassette tapes, in case you are too young to know).  Anyway, I was hoping for another album that would stay (now in my 5-disc changer) for at least a full year without my having to swap it out.  Unfortunately, this is not what I got in this album.  While there are tracks on this album that capture the energy and passion of the Beastie Boys of old, too much of this record feels like preaching. Although I agree with much of what they have to say, they now do so in such a politically over-hyped fashion that it detracts from their music.  Truly, there are some great songs on this record.  But if you listen to this album and then to Paul's Boutique, Licensed to Ill or another great one, you will quickly realize that this is not the Beastie Boys who revolutionized music in the late 20th century"
1,"First of all, Jump is too good of a track. I still haven't heard the rest of this CD because I just put jump on repeat and rap at the top of my lungs on my 45 minute commute. It ends up being about 10 times each way to work and if I'm at a long light, I look a little nuts for rapping to the song twice, but like I've always told people, if yelling a rap song by 12 year olds at the top of your lungs is wrong, I don't want to be in prison. The other problem I have with this thing is that if you try to be like Kriss Cross, you can't hold a job. If you are a true Kriss Krosser, you braid your hair and wear your clothes backwards. I got a job with a bank when I graduated from the U of Phoenix and I showed up on my first day with my suit on backwards. I started getting a bunch of customer complaints and they would call my Manager, Mr. Gingercrap, up to tell me they had a problem with my attire. Little did they know that I wired the intercom system to play Jump by the rap kings. I just pushed play and got on the drive thru teller mic and busted a groove in my reverse suit. I got fired. Well, after getting fired six other times from places like Burger King, Jiffy Lube, Ted pants shack, Jorks and Microsubs I decided to be a roller rink cop. I make kids leave the floor if they skate too fast. If they resist my orders, I have a tazer that I use without hesitation. I usually whisper for them to leave the rink so they say they can't hear me. Stop! Tazer time!! They don't care how I dress and pay me like 5 buks an hour. Yup, I'm at another level"
4,"I first need to say, if it weren't for the DVD and all of its features, ANYWHERE BUT HOME would have gotten three stars. I say this because, Evanescence does not sound as good live as they do in the studio.   THE CD: This contains the audio to the rock band's performance live in Paris. It also has the album's most beautiful and stand out track: ""Missing"".  THE CONCERT: The overall sound balance for this rock band is way off for this performance and the distorted guitars tend to drown out anything in the form of a musical line. Amy Lee also has her share of troubles for this performance. She can sing her high loud notes pretty well, but her lower ones tend to be in a constant use of pedal tones. Late into the performance, Amy's voice cracks and even starts to give out on her. She does however, know how to work the crowd. The bands newer tracks are well performed, and the covers they perform sound better than their own work. This is good and bad; it shows that Evanescence can play pretty well, but they need a lot more practice playing live and communicating with each other live. The best part to this concert is getting to see the beautiful Amy Lee perform and add new and very interesting introductions to some of the band's songs.  Awesome performances include: ""Thoughtless"" ""Breathe No More"" ""Farther Away"" ""Bring Me to Life"" ""Whisper""  DVD FEATURES: This disc is awesome because it has so many features. It of course has Evanescence's performance in Paris. It also has music videos for ""Going Under"", ""Bring Me to Life"", ""Everybody's Fool"", and ""My Immortal"". There is also a hidden video icon of Evanescence's band symbol. When this is activated, another live performance of ""Bring Me to Life"" is played. The disc also has tons of rehearsal, bloopers, and on the road footage; including Evanescence's tour with Seether. The credits also have the audio to Evanescence's newest track ""Missing"". ANYWHERE BUT HOME is an interesting concert and a fun look into Evanescence's life, I recomend viewing it"
1,Another great player selling out to sell more.  Seems like another outbreak of the Kenny bug.  I'm sure any jazz aficianado would agree with me when I say that Gerald Albright is a much more comprehensive player than this album suggets.   Check out the 'Live at Birdland West' album for a taste of what Mr. Albright is really about.
1,THIS IS A GREAT CD IF YOU ARE A MUSIC LOVER AS I AM.BILLY COBHAM IS ONE OF THE GREATEST DRUMMERS EVER!!!
2,"I purchased Hotel Costes backwards from 6,5,4 and then 2. I don't know why I skipped 3 and bought 2 first.  But 3 and 1 isn't worth listening to, unless you want the whole collection of the Hotel Costes series"
2,"I wanted to like BROTHERHOOD, for the simple reason that nearly every New Order fan this side of the galaxy has dismissed it, usually with a faint whiff of snobbery (or at least apathy). Turns out they were right: BROTHERHOOD is half an album. Most of its nine songs feel unfinished, as if the band wanted to cash in on the success of their 1985 smash LOW-LIFE and didn't care about the end result. BROTHERHOOD is a rush job, plain and simple, but there are still glimmers of hope within this bare-bones effort.   ""As It Is When It Was"" overcomes the album's overall muddy production by dint of being mostly acoustic, and the melody is quite lovely. ""All Day Long"", the emotional centerpiece of the album by default, is an intelligent (if half-hearted) protest against child abuse. While ""Angel Dust"" lacks a decent hook, its subtly danceable beat and effective synth noodlings will at least briefly hold your interest. And the toss-off ""Every Little Counts"" has a charming sense of humor that is too often lacking in New Order's work.  The most popular song on BROTHERHOOD is, of course, ""Bizarre Love Triangle"". So good it seems to belong to a different album entirely, ""Bizarre Love Triangle"" is truly New Order's masterpiece. The solid beat, slick sequencer work, and gorgeous melody showcase the band at their best: catchy, danceable, and downright euphoric. (Imagine how well it would have fit on LOW-LIFE.)  Sadly, the rest of BROTHERHOOD is unremarkable. The album's production neatly mixes rock with electronic flourishes, which has become New Order's signature sound, but the songwriting doesn't measure up. Buy the album if you're a trainspotter, but casual New Order fans would be better off picking up LOW-LIFE or 1983's POWER, CORRUPTION AND LIES. This one is just a footnote."
1,"Somewhere in the universe, statistically speaking, there has to be a band more stultifying than Rush. It's hard to imagine that God could be so cruel, but remember, she gave us Boston (the band, that is) too. This stuff is so painful, it almost makes rap sound good"
2,"god forbid i be so bold as to trash a classic.  and yes, maybe because of all the raving reviews from my friends and from the book's great reputation, i entered it with high expectations. - which the book however did not satisfy.  yes, it is a good comedic parody of the upper class of the time, a lampoon of the courtship ritual, and of course oh so witty, blah blah blah, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.  the main character was likeable, but that aside, i found it completely insufferable to read through, and absolutely painfully boring.  every subsequent event from the very beginning could be predicted, let alone the ending.  not that anything really ever happens - the entire book could be summed up with, ""then they walked and talked and had tea and walked and talked and had tea, walked and talked and had more tea, then got married and lived happily ever after.""  the entire novel was a headache of girly gossip and mental drama.  it would save more time just to watch a chick flick.  so if you're interested in the relationship fiascos of fictious characters, witnessing the agony over who's going to marry who (even though the reader could already predict the happily-ever-after match-making light-years in advance), then this is the book for you!!  if not, then i suggest picking up some dan brown.           "
5,"First of all i love the pet shop boys they take me back to the decade of the 80's with this collection!!!! Each song has a untique flavor to them and they are so much fun to listen to again and again!!!!! With the beginning of the album which would be ""West End Girls"" to "" Jealously""!!!!!! If you love the pet shop boys then go buy this album not because of the band,but for the great 80 songs that take us back in the day!!!"
5,"Old school. If you have a teen into rap this is a great alternative to ""SHOW THE PUPS"" how it was done before all women were treated as dirt in videos and and gangsters were hero's. The topic is party. the beat is rap/rock and it the ""BOYS"" influenced many of todays artists. And the infamous Brass Monkey song is still HOT HOT HOT. If you're a fan of any rap or roc or a parent that wants to add some depth to your teen's gangster heavy library-head to the old school kind of cool and you will find music you can both live with"
5,"This is undoubtably the Beasties' best CD. There still great now, but on here they're more Rap/Rock, which they left behind later on for straight up rap/hip-hop, which isn't a bad thing. Most rap nowadays really sucks goats(*cough*cough50centmikejonesliljonseanpaulpaulwall *cough*cough). This great disc features such classics as Girls, No Sleep Til' Brooklyn(the Beasties best song), Rymin and Stealin(which has a rather nice tribute to The Clash), Fight For Your Right, Hold it Now Hit It, And the infamous Brass Monkey. If you're a fan of any rap or rock, I highly reccomend this amazing CD"
2,"I'm a huge fan of Dream Theater, owning all their studio albums, and some singles. I loved SFAM, I&W, SDOIT, and Awake. After their peak at SFAM, I didn't expect them to release anything better. But I didn't expect them to release anything that was too bad.  They did.  Octavarium, flat out, isn't Dream Theater. No guitar or drum solos, not flourishes, no pretenstious and self-indulgent metal peices. Buy this if you like U2 or Coldplay, don't buy it if you like Dream Theater."
1,"Seriously, folks...this band SUCKS! Every one of these hits (Dancing Queen, Sugar Sugar, Mamma Mia, Take a Chance on Me) is dated, sugary, and awful as awful gets. How they scored any hits whatsoever is beyond me. KEEP AWAY!!!!!!!"
5,Break down and burn your fence for this one. It is worth the fumes. I was living in a place in Tucson for this release and we burnt the whole fence down
1,"Nelly is one of the most annoying ignorant rappers I have ever heard. I do give him props on his first album, but he went downhill and started that whole ""I can make great club beats, but write bubblegum lyrics over it"" trend. This sadly created all the Chingys, Lil Johns and so on. The guy doesn't add any substance to his music, yet he sells millions thanks to MTV. Just save your money on real artist that makes real music"
4,"Passion, a collection of some of the most popular young worship leaders (including Chris Tomlin, Charlie Hall, Matt Redman and David Crowder) released Hymns Ancient & Modern in 2004. There is some interpretation of the hymns, and a couple have a chorus added to them, but on the whole the artists stay quite close to the traditional tunes. To ""O Worship The King,"" for example, Chris Tomlin adds the chorus, ""You alone are the matchless King / To you alone be all majesty / Your glories and wonders, what tongues can recite? / You breathe in the air, You shine in the light."" Some of the standouts on this album are ""The Solid Rock,"" ""All Hail the Power of Jesus' Name,"" and ""All Creatures of Our God and King."" The liner notes include a brief description of each of the songs along with information about the author. It is quite a good album if you enjoy the ""Passion"" sound and are able to enjoy hymns with a bit of a worship music feel to them"
1,"Wack rhymes make me puke via my ear canal. That's how wack Paul Wall is. After I have eaten a full meal and listened to Paul wall, My dinner is regurgitated through my ears. I am sooooooooooo tired of these garbage rappers polluting the airwaves with garbage. This guy wouldn't know lyrical content if I slapped him with a Mos Def CD"
4,"The first CD is 5 stars.  It has great continuity that carries over from track to track.  The combination of vocals and non-vocals is just right because you don't feel burnt out by one or the other.  One of the cooler parts about the first CD is tracks such as Under the Sun make excellent use of your left and right speaker channels.  There is this weird echo effect that moves from your left to right speaker that is amazing if you have a good sound system.  Normally music makes inefficient use of the speaker channels, but a few songs selected by Armin goes against this trend.  These days there is a lot of good electronic music out there, but messing with the speaker channels immerses you even more in the acoustic environment.  All the songs Armin picked become remember able classics once you hear them several times because a few do sound monotonous.  The second CD is 3 stars.  It doesn't have the energy and momentum that CD1 has and there aren't as many vocal tracks to break up the electronic beats.  Armin could probably have introduced more variety into CD2 such as breakbeat, house, and tribal, but it is what it is.     "
2,"Despite all the rave reviews I'm wondering if this is a dreaded rerecord. Maybe I'm paranoid, but the country music industry is so sleazy. And some stars feel entitled to cash in. How else can you explain the John Anderson Anthology...Horror.  (John, how could you?) Or the Bill Anderson Oh Boy Classic [Oh boy here comes a rerecord). Hey, the CD sounds great. But what makes me suspiscious is that there are no copyright dates anywhere on this CD except for one. Also the cryptic message on the inside sleeve.  Could someone please clear this up. And not some RCR Bud Logan shill either. John Conlee is one of my hero's and this is really worrying me. I can't look at this CD with Rose Colered Glasses anymore"
5,"Ever since they vanished from the music world, I've been searching the airwaves for just a hint of anything ""Catherine Wheel"" and then BLAM I hit Rob Dickinson's solo album while slogging through I-tunes.  Ahhh that voice....Ahhh those lyrics...seductive, intelligent.....wonderful. I'm in love with music once again."
1,"Well what the hell to expect from a big cynical misanthrope such as myself?  Flowery bubbly warm rays of sunshine?  HELL NO!  You see folks it's people like Lil Jon that make me think in such a morbid manner.  When I see Special Ed. failures who look and act like mental house rejects make lots of money I tend to get a little pessimistic.  BUT CAN YOU BLAME ME?  Seriously, let's screw our heads on tightly and think about this for a second, why would a sane person actually listen to let alone actually purchase this cd?  This is a complete joke.  I'm simply calling it like I see it.  Lil Jon deserves no respect from any human being, not even his crack head of a mother.    Actually you might as well compare Lil Jon to Elmo, Elmo being a puppet has a MILLION times more skill at what he does.  At least Elmo is a good and wholesome children's icon that kids can have fun with.  If I ever have a kid someday Elmo will still be a hit with the kids but Lil Jon will still be laughed at once all his ""fans"" grow up and realize how stupid they were to actually buy into his garbage he pans off as ""music"".  Meh, well who I am kidding this review (like my last 6) probably won't even get posted anyway. "
1,"It's simply not the best of Sting '84-'94.  The version of We'll Be Together (a great song) is an alternate take (mix?), VASTLY inferior to the album / radio version.  It's anemic.  Lacks the punch.  In a word -- sucks.  That you're not told this on the cover is misleading.  I really enjoy Mr. Sumner's music.  All the other tunes are as they should be, and they are terrific.  4-5 stars.  But don't buy this product if you expect to hear what you've heard on the album or the radio"
5,I have been a fan of Sting ever since I was in college.  I actually got to see him in person in the late 80's.  I have just about every cd he has ever put out so when this one did I ran right out and bought it.  Every song on it is great and it IS one of my most favorite cd's I own.   
5,"After leaving The Police in 1984, Sting launched a hugely successful solo career, garnering top selling albums and a string of top forty hits. In 1994, A & M released ""Fields Of Gold: The Best Of Sting 1984-1994"", a 14 song collection containing almost all of Sting's hits up to that time as well as some new recordings.  Well, 10 years has passed since its release, and Sting has made some new recordings. So the question is, how does ""Fields Of Gold"" hold up? Here are the positives and the negatives.  Positives: -If you're a casual fan only interested in having Sting's radio hits, than this collection is for you, as it includes ""If You Love Somebody (Set Them Free)"", ""Fortress Around Your Heart"", ""Be Still My Beating Heart"", ""Russians"", ""We'll Be Together"", ""All This Time"", ""If I Ever Lose My Faith In You"" and ""Fields Of Gold"". So basically, all the hits you could possibly want are here. -The sound is great. -It is a very afforable and easy to find compilation. -It includes some songs recorded for the album that are only available here. They're all good songs, especially the hit single ""When We Dance"".  Negatives: -This collection is missing a top twenty hit: ""Love Is The Seventh Wave"" reached number 17 in 1986. That's my main caveat. -""Mad About You"" was never a single (at least in the U.S.) but received a lot of airplay, enough to warrant inclusion on this cd. -Some of these songs are remixes. However, they work, though I prefer the original version of ""We'll Be Together"". -No liner notes. -As I said, this collection is leaving out later hits like ""I'm So Happy I Can't Stop Crying"", ""Brand New Day"" and the top twenty hit ""Desert Rose"". So if you want to get those songs, you'll have to get the albums they're on.  Overall, ""Fields Of Gold"" holds up very well. It is completely unneccessary for hardcore Sting fans (unless they're completists), but if you're a casual fan, than you must own this collection"
1,Sorry...  I expected the original lineup when I purchased this CD.  Now I'll have to go looking for all the songs that are missing...  Buyer Beware
5,"A great show makes a great CD. I will never understand why this show didn't become a hit! I saw this show at a local amateur theater and have loved it ever since. Maltby and Shire are the best composer and lyricists to never have a successful B'way show. This score is great- Fatherhood Blues, I Want It All, The Story Goes On, The Ladies Singing Their Song- These are unforgetable and deserved to be heard. Get this gem"
2,"Before getting steamed at the title of my review, take time and read my review in an objective sense. My critical anaylsis of this album was done strictly as objective as possible. I took my time listening to every single ""song"" on this album, so this isn't an uninformed review. Now to the review. ------------------------------------------------------------  Hell on Earth, Mobb Deeps third release, came out during the era of the media-fabricated and infamous east-coast-west-coast beef. Throughout the album, you get a sense that the artist where suffucated by the negative climate of the time. The songs and lyrics on this album, in every way, reflect that era. Starting off the album is a deep bass mixed with a dark-drum line instrumental. Havoc and Prodigy lace the beat with self glorifying, tough guy lyrics that accentuate the grimy instrumental. Though this album has 14 tracks, you've be hardpressed to differentiate one from the other if it wasn't for the switch of beat. The level of variation in subject matter on this album is so limited that a review of one tracks lyrics will tell you all you need to know about the album, lyric wise. There are little to no song concepts on this album. Nearly every single track on Hell on Earth is polluted with numerous references to someone getting shot, how much better Prodigy and Havoc are than you, and how they are from Queensbridge, etc. Through the lyrical context of this album, you almost get the sense that Mobb Deep was too consumed with the negative climate of rap at the time. You get the sense that they're lashing out at anyone and everyone that may pose as a potential threat to them. Cuts like ""Drop a gem on them"" and ""Bloodsport"" find them verbally attacking the late Tupac Shakur. The lyrics on this album get so rediculous at times that you have to wonder what these guys were thinking. You truely have to sit back and question how these guys could put out track after track of the same tired material. About the only saving grace of this album is the instrumentals. Dark, grimey, and horror movie like, they paint a background of horror and terror. Though good, the instrumentals of this album also start to sound repetitive as you get deeper into the album. After a while, they all start to sound like a cluster of the same stuff.  I'm sorry, but in no way shape or form is this as great of an album as some have stated. Lack of variation in topics, Ignorant, mindless gun and thug brovado give this album no depth. If you're someone that is looking for intelligent lyrics or creative concepts, do yourself a favor and avoid Hell on Earth at all cost"
5,"I love Saving Jane and the songs off this album are GREEAT! It's flippin awesome times a gazillion,a MUST BUY! Saving Jane ROCKS, no doubt!&lt;33"
1,"This musician, if you can call him that, should be embarrassed.  If he has something to say, more people would listen if he didn't use such vulgar language and stopped talking about his body parts.  I won't be buying this and my kids won't either.  Repulsive"
5,Alan Jackson is my favorite country singer. This is one of my favorites. I love every hymn that he has done. I play it constantly and it brings back memories. His wife and daughter did very well. One of his best!! 
4,all college students should watch st. elmos fire and all 80's babies should get the soundtrack to remind them the good ol days
5,"Eric Clapton speaks to the heart and soul and makes you smile and bop every time you listen.  He takes you out of your current space and into other places, leaving you enriched by the journey"
1,"WHAT A LOUSY MOVIE! AND I READ NOTHING BUT GLOWING REVIEWS ABOUT THIS CONVOLUTED PIECE OF BAD ACTING, BAD STORIED MOVIE. PLEASSSEEE, SAVE YOUR MONEY THIS IS A BAD MOVIE, BORING AND ALL-AND-ALL A LOUSY STORY. I DON'T RECOMMEND IT"
1,"Do you remember the guy in high school or college who tried to be the class clown but failed miserably? Well, Eugene Mirman is less entertaining than that guy.  I'm not being sarcastic about the pity laughter... that's the most laughter here, and yes, this was recorded live. How the record company heard this and still felt comfortable releasing it is beyond me. Perhaps it's a tax write-off"
4,"This album is the single reason Jewel is what she is today.  Without this album I feel that Jewel would never have been able to establish herself musically, at least not to the point of success she has today.  Raw, Untraditional, Brave, Naked, these can all descibe her first album.  Unlike most other hit records this album is a nice departure from the norm.  Worth a listen"
1,"Do you think if I wrote some nursery rhyme lyrics from bizzaro world and starting singing in a voice more suited to Sesame Street that I could get a record contract too like Devendra Banhart? His record has to be some kind of inside joke, or the efforts of one seriously untalented individual. Sprouting nonsensical phrases one after the other might pass as genius among some people but I want a bit more substance to my music. I found this record personally insulting because it's obvious that someone out there felt you can just put out any old crap filled with ""strange and fantastic"" lyrics that are ultimately meaningless and people would evitably go out and buy it because it's 'unique' and that your uncool if you don't get 'it' (whatever 'it' is). If you want to listen to a quality record by a singer-songwriter than go check out Bright Eyes' ""I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning"" or Damien Rice's ""O"" and steer clear of this insult to good taste"
1,This music is a rip off. All is borrowed to the 4 first albums of Marc Bolan playing under the name of Tyranosaurus Rex. Something more bluesy here and there but nothing allowing to give any credit to this guy.  A shame
5,"I saw the music video for this song a few days ago and it was stuck in my head for days! Canadian singer Daniel Powter is definitely talented, and it shows in his first single. I cannot wait for his self-titled album to be released in October so that I can listen to the rest of the songs."
5,"This is the first T.M.R. cd I ever bought and it truly made me into a fan. It's got great upbeat songs like Abort//Clear and Out of Orbit and classics like Invoke (gundam Seed) and Heart of Sword (Rurouni Kenshin). He has a truly unique voice and can really touch your soul. (Even if you can't understand what he's saying, it's cool. Go look for translations then!) Anyway, I reccomend this cd to any Jpop or Jrock fan. He truly is a great artist that I think you'll enjoy time and time again. 5stars baby 5 stars! Holla"
5,"I love T.M. Revolutions music, it is just so upbeat and so awesome their are hardly any words !  I love this CD, I listen to it all the time!  My favorite tracks are Invoke, Meteor, and Heart of Sword!  He is such an awesome singer!  I highly recommend his music to anyone who is into jpop or wanting to get into jpop! "
1,"During Pearl Jam's riot act tour in 2003, Sleater Kinney was  the opening band.I got tickets for the show. In preperation  for the concert, I picked up a few kinney albums. First this one. For one I had heard songs at the college station I worked and since one member Janet weiss was in Quasi( a great band) I thought it couldn't be all bad. At  first listening to the albums it was alright. Then it got  annoying. Those high pitched screams from the singer began to be fingernails on a chalkboard. Repetitive, middle of the road punk. Then came the concert. Once Sleater hit the stage, everyone and I mean everyone around me had no clue who they were. They were all asking me, who's this? I had to tell them all. No one was digging the concert. Minamal applause. No dancing or cheering, nothing. The songs that night didn't flow. The usual screaming was,as always, ear screeching and annoying. A few people mis-took the bassist for a man, but we were in the nose-bleed seats. Once sleater-kinney did their  last song and walked off stage the audience clapped with much enthusiasim, cause they knew they were finally done"
1,Maybe it's just me and I'm expecting so much when I spend my money or a little bit of time listenin' to these new n*ggas. But I'm just not feelin' this s*it here. I fell asleep mid way through this album. I just can't seem to understand why these n*ggas is so one dimesional. I cant underdstand why people still supportin' these n*ggas. Not one track was tolerable. If dis cd belonged to me i would threw this s*it away already. Word of advice dont buy this.
4,"After Ja Rule rose in popularity throughout the years since his debut, ""Venni Vetti Vecci"" in 1999, now in 2003 lots of things have changed.  50 Cent and his G-Unit crew rose up from the streets of New York and took the rap game by storm and their goal was to destroy Ja Rule and expose him as a poser.  After numerous disses throughout the years when 50 and his clique were in the underground scene til 2003, Ja Rule's career slowly began to crumble before his eyes.  So with this release, ""Blood in My Eye,"" Ja is out to prove that he still got that gangsta s*** in him.  Can Ja turn his career back around or will it further put him in the grave?  1. Murder (Intro) - No Rating  2. The Life (Featuring Hussein Fatal, Caddillac Tah & James Gotti) - 4/5  3. Clap Back - Minute+ Talking Intro - 4/5  4. The Crown (Featuring Sizzla) - 4/5  5.

Blood in My Eye (Featuring Hussein Fatal) - 4/5  13. It's Murda (Freestyle)[Bonus Track](Featuring Hussein Fatal) - 4/5  14. The Wrap (Freestyle)[Bonus Track](Featuring Hussein Fatal) - 3.5/5  Overall:  41/50  4 Stars  Ja Rule does indeed return to his roots.....somewhat.  Mostly every track has Ja spitting with anger dissing 50, Eminem, DMX, Dr. Dre and mostly every other rapper who dissed him.  He still got some pretty hot radio tracks but most of the album is filled with semi-hardcore tracks.  This was the first ""flop"" in Ja Rules career.  This album barely pushed over 400,000 units to date.  Still a pretty good record though, check it out"
1,"This is what occured when I heard this album. I immediately had to run to the bathroom and crap my life out. And guess what?!?!?!?!?! There was blood in my stool. Damn you jeffery for polluting this world with your awful lyrics, curse you for wasting beats, and shame on you for calling this album ""blood in my eye"" when you don't even know the history behind the book called ""blood in my eye"". Listen to us Ja quit rapping and go work at kfc"
1,"This is an awful record.  The beats are a complete joke.  Whoever produced this crap must have been strung out or somethin', cuz no1 in there right mind would let this sh** see the light of day.  And everyone already knows ja can't write so it's expected that the lyrics would be trash too.  Forget this record.  Murder Inc is dead"
5,"I had the opportunity to see Tom Braxton play for an extremely happy crowd at his almamader, Dunbar Middle School (then Dunbar High School). ""Julian's Smile"" and ""Bounce"" are superbly played, smoothe and fresh sound. See him live if you get the chance, buy the CD anyway"
5,My daughters and I love this CD.  It is fun to sing along and we have a great time listening to it.  I think that the songs provide my children with exposure to older music which is much different from the sounds they usually listen to.  We really enjoy it for how fun and invigorating it is to listen to
5,"my favorite songs are ""she really wants you"", ""video"", and  ""little bombs"". excellent album. her 2nd best beside bachelor no.2"
5,"This is definitely one of those albums that you can play over and over again and discover something new and brilliant each time.  The lyrics are brilliant, the melodies are beautiful and the music is simply enchanting.  Shannon McNally has really found her stride with this album.  Personal favs include ""Pale Moon"" ""The Hard Way"" and her cover of Taj's ""Lovin' In My Baby's Eyes."" "
5,"excellent recording, very destictively colored music....I was impressed and am listening to it quite frequently."
5,"Echo Echo is a marvelous fusion of alternative, punk and Irish folk music. It is by far their best album"
1,I bought one of these CD's many years ago and found out the hard way.  What a joke and a ripoff.  No original artists and nowhere on the CD does it say this.  I never bought another one. 
2,"I think they put the wrong cd in the case because most of sublimes good stuff is missing.  Weird.  Buy 40oz to freedom or anything other than this cd if you do not already have them.  It's has some good songs but false advertisement comes to mind.  Hardcore sublimers may want it, but you never really have to open it.     "
2,"When I listened to this CD I actually expected to hear Gloria Estafan singing on some of these songs.  Some of them seem like they were written for her.  Wild Card has a few good songs on it.  The title track is okay.  Moonlight and King Of Hearts are better.  The last good CD by the Rippington's was Weekend In Monaco.  Changes in personnel, locations, and labels haven't proved to be too good for Russ's music.  He's made his money and can experiment with various ideas.  Wild Card is loser in my opinion, but at least it's better than Brave New World"
5,"This is one of the greatest CDs ever recorded. Jason Robert Brown is an amazingly gifted songwriter and an incredible vocalist. Not to mention he must have made some pact with Satan or something to be able to play the piano like that.   This CD has music that is catchy, thoughtful, sincere, and beautiful.   An amazine CD."
2,"I'm a huge u2 fan but maybe I'm the only one on this world who doesn't like r.e.m. very much.I find songs like drive,everybody hurts and man on the moon(one of my favourite)very beautiful.But the other songs are boring and ripetitive.I don't know why people say that this is one of the best album in music.I hope one day I'll understand this band.."
2,"then just pick up Appetite For Destruction  AFD was one of the greatest rock albums ever made.  I wanted to hate the album so much.  I was an alternative/avant guard snob when AFD was released.  To me, these clowns were just another hairspray band. But I took a long car trip with some chick I was banging and her roommate. The roommate played the tape at least three times on the trip.  By the end, I was hooked.  That's the mark of truly great art.  If it can draw in someone who's predisposed to hate it, its got something special.  I looked forward to the next album, G N' R Lies.  But when it came out, I was disappointed.  It was ok, but hardly the cultural epoch that was AFD.  Nice Boys was kind of fun. Used to Love Her was a humorous novelty song. Mama Kin was a decent cover, but no real improvement over the original.  The rest of the disk was just crap.  But what the hell, its was just an EP right? Something to tide us over until the next brutal masterpiece.  Then came GnR's death knell, the two Use Your Illusions.  Over-produced, bloated, boring and pretentious.  Everything I had always hated Hair-Metal for in the first place.  Gone was the sound of the alley ways of Sunset Boulevard, replaced by the sound of computers, maids and Beverley Hills hookers n blow parties.  Rock n Roll sung by a guy in custom-ripped jeans who just came out of a session with his hair stylist and manicurist.  Nothing to see here.  Move along.  So, if you want to see the genius and promise of GnR, just pick up Appetite For Destruction, and pretend they just broke up after creating one of the greatest albums of all time"
5,"An unfortunate trend amongst young male country singers from the early 1990s was to produce an outstanding, real country first album before veering down the path of increasingly pop-driven music. This was never more true than in the case of John Michael Montgomery, whose 1992 debut CD Life's A Dance is an undoubted 5 star release. Full of great stone country (Beer And Bones, Life's A Dance, Nickels And Dimes And Love - originally recorded by Charley Pride - and Dream On Texas Ladies), Montgomery's infectious vocal twang saw him immediately rack up the first of several country number ones. The album's biggest hit was the quality ballad, I Love The Way You Love Me. Unfortunately, as early as his second album Kickin' It Up (the title suggests more excitement than the album delivered), Montgomery's song selections became more MOR and less traditional country. His greatest hits CD is worth a listen, but if you want one JMM album in your collection, it has to be this, his first"
1,"I made it half way through before piercing my eardrums with sharpened pencils.  If you can buy the karaoke version, this might be pretty good, otherwise you will get more artistry from the latest Yanni cd.  The vocals are so twee even a kindergartner would blush in shame"
1,"There is a hint that Jessica has a good voice, but apparently she is not sure where she belongs.  Some of the songs have a southern Gospel feel, and I must confess, that personally, I do not like that wailing type of music.  But, if you do, you will like SOME of the tracks.  However, on other tracks, she uses this breathy quality, that I suppose, is trying to imitate a sexy nightclub singer.  These two styles do not work well together.  Except for die-hard Jessica fans, this is not a particularly good album.  It is ho-hum pop and even less attractive as Christmas music.  At times I am reminded of Marilyn Monroe singing ""Happy Birthday, Mr. President.""  The problem is that Marilyn was NOT known as a singer.  Jessica needs to rethink her presentation.  Only buy this album if you think Jessica is the greatest thing since Edison invented the light bulb."
1,"I READ ALL THE REVIEWS ABOUT THIS BOXED SET AND NOBODY EVER SAID THAT THE DVD IS SO DARK THAT MOST OF THE TIME YOU SEE A OUTLINE OF BRUCE ONLY. I DON'T CARE IF THIS IS A PIECE OF HISTORY, IF YOU CAN'T SEE THE MAIN PERFORMER THEN WHY WASTE THE SPACE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THE ONLY PERSON THAT YOU CAN SEE GOOD IS THE SAX PLAYER BECAUSE HE'S WEARING A WHITE SUIT AND ONCE IN A WHILE THEY PUT A WHITE SPOT ON HIM. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY THE OTHER DVD'S....................."
5,"I feel like such a fool!  This album is 6 years old and I heard it for the first time a few weeks ago.  What's more, I've since asked several of my friends who also love neo-soul music if they've heard it, and may of them didn't even know WHO I was talking about.  That is a crime, because this album is fantastic.  Fantastic, I say.  It's one of those albums where I did not have to look at the album credits to see who wrote and produced the songs.  It's obvious from how his voice perfectly compliments the music that his is not simply the voice chosen to sing these songs that someone else wrote.  This is what I appreciate most about the Neo-soul genre; the tendency for the artists who perform the music to be more than just singers.  They are musicians.  (This is what is so frustrating about Brian McKnight, incidentally.  He is a musician, but still refuses to sing in his vocal range.  Many of the songs that he has written for himself are too high for him!  That just shouldn't be)  In any case, go get this album if you like good music"
4,"When Green Day changed up their sound around the mid-90's and came through with a more slickly produced, commercial sound, a lot of their loyal fans didn't like it. But what they seemingly forgot to look at amidst their curious anger is that Green Day's new stuff sounded really good ('Warning' especially), even though, yeah, it sounded quite a bit different.  When it comes to Bob Dylan, die-hard fans compare an album like Empire Burlesque  (and probably a couple before it) with the likes of Highway 61 Revisited and Bringing It All Back Home, and a lot of them not only don't like the change but are agitated with their sneaky hero, though his status as 'constantly-looked-up-to'  remains in tact.  Granted, as much as I like Empire Burlesque, it has to be careful with itself because as it goes from one song to the next you almost feel like you're going to hear this as a soundtrack for a really syrupy Cameron Crowe movie, and that's no good.  But Dylan's sensibilty doesn't go quite that far down the wimpy direction as he remains hard-hearted and overly introspective, even if fairly non-sensical at times.  I love songs like 'Tight Connection to My Heart'   'I'll Remember You'    'Emotionally Yours'   and 'Never Gonna Be The Same Again.' Though the disk sounds slicker than usual, it's a mistake to think the authenticity level dropped at all. If anything, he seems to be connecting with these songs at a higher degree than what is usual with him.  Another great thing about this album is that it's pretty consistent. A couple of the tunes are slighter but none of them are bad and they're all at least a litte above mediocre, with a high portion of it ranging from good to excellent. And that's saying a lot for someone like Dylan, who is so terribly inconsistent. Not long ago I listend to Planet Waves and there are 2-3 outrageously listenable songs there but so much of it is so mediocre.   I've always thought Dylan likes being disliked and that's why he puts out such terrible songs intermingled with all the stuff that's good.  He doesn't want people coming too close and that desire of his seems to draw his fans near all the more.  I saw Dylan in concert last year and he was on keyboards due to some kind of arthritis, or something. There was a guitar planted on the center of the stage and after every song Dylan walked over, with his back hunched over and his shoulders sulking, his white warm-up suit and cowboy hat making him look like a modern-day Texas circus hand. Once there he would walk around the vicinity of the guitar and oftentimes the crowd's screaming would peak, but every time Dylan did not pick up the guitar and instead slowly meandered over to his keyboards. Not once did he pick up the guitar that night but he led the audience to believe he would about 15-20 times. What a tease.   On Empire Burlesque he seems to have softened up and not minded creating something nice all the way through. And those strange actions of his which somehow draw his worshipers ever nigher are absent here, and I'm thankful for that"
1,"Ok lets get right to the point veary chingon movie, lots of action good gangster s*** but this!!! I mean wheres the firme musica??? You would think with such a great movie the soundtrack to the movie would be so bueno but it just doesent grab my attention at all. I mean some of the songs are good like the one bye Funkadoobiest and Girls It Aint Easy bye the 4 Corners and the one bye Boss Catch Hit and Run but on these songs they are a different version of the songs not the ones like the way they were in the movie and they left some good songs out for instence, the one So Ruff so Tuff by Zapp and Roger great song!!! but not on there. Well I have them already it's just the point that they left some stuff out. Well... just understand me, in what i'm saying and get somthing else like the Bound By Honor soundtrack. Now thats a good one!!! as for the 1 in rating well you figure it out"
2,"Harry Connick, Jr. did a fair job representing the musical legends that were found in the movie, but nonetheless, this soundtrack should contain the artists who created the songs and/or who were featured in the motion picture. If you are purchasing this CD because you enjoy the classics performed by musical legends, as I do, then I do not recommend this CD; instead I would buy the originals"
2,This CD is NOT the music soundtrack from the movie.  It's only some of the music that is in the movie.  I was very disappointed.  I wanted the original soundtrack of the music you hear when you watch the movie.  That's why I purchased it.  Is the original soundtrack NOT available or was it not produced?  I wouldn't buy this CD again.
2,"I am pro-Neal Schon.  I own many of his solo efforts and every Journey album to date.  However, I honestly can't understand why everyone is rating this album with 5 stars.  It simply does not meet the mark on this one.    None of the tracks have a theme that will 'grab' you.  These aren't songs that will stick in your head.  Saying that this album is 'Neal exploring his melodic side' is pretty inaccurate.  If want to hear Neal's 'melodic side,' by ""Beyond the Thunder...."" one of his best to date.  These tracks are him basically exploring his improvisational side and jamming to a drum machine.  Even live drum tracks by a great drummer such as Omar Hakim sound as if they are programmed.  I was disappointed on this one.  Neal is an exceptional guitarist....one of the best in the world.  He just didn't hit the mark on this one. "
2,"It's more grown up than her previous albums in bad way.  I can't play a few of the songs with my kids around.  While the inappropriate songs may be catchy, it's disappointing that they had to be so ""give it to me"".  It's also missing the ""rap/yodeling/soul"" stuff that made me like her so much in the first album"
5,"I heard ""Dirty Harry"" on Upop XM and began thinking about taking a chance on buying the album.  Then my wife came home one day and said she heard a song on a local station and really liked it-but she didn't know the title or artist.  The station helped when she emailed them and it turned out to be ""Feel Good Inc"" from the same album!  The choice was now clear!  Log on the Amazon! A first listen to the whole album was good, but not as good as I had anticipated. The second, third, and fourth listen hooked me good!  I even like the 2 cuts I first thought were terrible.  Now I will be getting a second album so I don't have to share"
5,"Every track on da CD is hott. Itz a good CD to ride to at night & make love to.  The girlz can sing their ass off. I really didnt know anything about these girls until 1 of my girls put me on to them & i have had their CD play-n ever since.  Like i said all the trackz are hott but my personal favorites are Get up on It, Surrender,& Keep On. If you are think-n about get-n it-get it...you'll love it & if u dont something wrong wit your earz. Not like-n this is like say-n 12 Play is wack & u know everybody love 12 PLa"
4,"Loved the movie and the music.  The soundtrack is good, but I was very disappointed not to have Usher's ""Yeah"" on the soundtrack - the dancing scene is one of the best parts of the movie for goodness' sake!  Oh well, still a good CD"
5,"Just in time for their induction into the Rock N' Roll Hall Of Fame comes this new Blondie collection that showcases some of the band's most popular, influential songs, material from their recent releases and a mash-up with one of the bands that influenced them. ""Sound & Vision,"" like most Best Of sets is both a good introduction to the band's music and a well-assembled collection for the casual listener who likes Blondie, but enough to purchase every album. There is no doubt that Debbie Harry and the gang not only produced good music, but were one of the main reasons why we have real chick rockers like Shirley Manson, Gwen Stefani and yes, Madonna. Befire Princess Diana ever graced magazine covers, Harry was the most photographed woman in the world but a real Punk at heart, posing at times with such figures as Joey Ramone and Iggy Pop (eventhough at one point Patti Smith told her to ""get the f--k out of rock n' roll""). ""Sound And Vision"" nicely shows what all the fuss was about in the late 70's through mid-80's. A lot of the songs have survived the test of time with a real sense of fun and energy like ""Call Me"" with it's roaring chorus and electro sheen while ""Heart Of Glass"" is still a classic jam, disco has died and yet this song remains. ""Rapture"" is still a long, dreamy anthem that brought hip-hop to a wider audience before Aerosmith and Run DMC ever broke the barrier of rock and rap. Newer material is also present here, ""Maria"" was a single off the band's 1999 album ""No Exit,"" but it still has that classic Blondie sound. However I do believe listeners are cheated here when it comes to the song ""Good Boys"" off their latest release, ""The Curse Of Blondie."" The original version is a great song, but the remix here makes the song kind of cold and hollow, the same for the ""In The Flesh"" remix which rips the song apart, turning it into cold, techno sludge. Luckily there is one worthy remix present, ""Rapture Riders,"" which brilliantly meshes ""Rapture"" with The Doors' ""Riders On The Storm."" Both songs flow perfectly together and it's a fitting combination since Blondie have always named The Doors as a prime influence and favorite band. Too bad Jim Morrison died in 1972, you get the feeling he and Harry would have done a marvelous duet. The extra DVD that comes with the set is a must for Blondie fans, many of the band's videos are included for classics like ""Heart Of Glass,"" ""The Tide Is High"" and even the recent videos for ""Maria"" and ""Good Boys."" ""Sight In Sound"" a fun ride through the Blondie catalogue and a must for collectors of classic rock anthologies, and a neat teaching tool for those who wanna know why girls like Gwen, Shirley and even Britney have been scandalous and glamorous and know how to pull it off and who they learned it from"
2,"Wow, I sampled the songs on this new CD and I really am surprised at the drop in quality and uniqueness Sting used to bring to the music.  Like DeNiro and Pacino.  Where are they now?  Doing comedy and bland movies.  Not like the movies of yester-year when they were top notch.  Stings voice is still among the best in the world, just the music behind him is what makes his CDs bland and uninteresting.  I mean, Techno and Rap.  It's like a mundane chant, much like the Sting of the past used to sing out about.  It looks like the music industry of today is not only responsible for some of the most uninteresting music and groups it's also consuming those that used to be the best.  It's really a shame to see an artist like Sting decline in his work.  Brand New Day was the start.  Although it wasn't all bad, but you got the sense that he was lost or beginning to lose his way and his style.  Oh, well, albums like ""Ten Summoner's Tale"", ""Nothing Like the Sun"", ""Soul Cages"", and ""Dream of the Blue Turtles"" were the best of his solo career.  Now, he's just earning a paycheck.  Farewell Sting.  It was nice knowing you"
2,IF YOUR A GARY ALLAN FAN I UNDERSTAND WHY.GARY'S VOICE IS GREAT BUT THE SONGS HE SINGS USUALLY [ARE WEAK].OF ALL HIS ALBUMS THIS IS THE WORST...
4,"Check out Augustana, without doubt last year's most promising new band, completely despite the fact that its own record label -- that'd be Epic, which has been in a tailspin since Polly Anthony left -- seems to have no clue whatever that they exist.  Their debut album, the extraordinary All the Stars and Boulevards, was tossed thoughtlessly into the marketplace a year ago and, minus even a modicum of press or publicity, got promptly crushed in the avalanche of fourth-quarter releases; its soaring title track -- one of `05's most potent -- was so thoroughly shunned by radio that it had to be a conspiracy.  So how's this for a dark horse story?  Practically as an afterthought as spring closed, Epic chose as Boulevards' second single the wistful, resplendent ""Boston"" and then sat on their dead, numb rumps while the song -- helped along by a simple but exquisite video that opens with a close-up of the band's twenty-one-year-old (!) lead singer Dan Layus (think 3 Doors Down's Brad Arnold with a more agile voice, and much much cuter) and fades to black with a shoreline of overturned pianos destroyed by the incoming tide -- built steadily, week on week, against all conventional wisdom which states that summer, with its easy melodies and breezy sentiments, is the wrong season in which to try to launch a complex, chorus-less single whose heroine is drowning in depression and desperation, and whose back half, in lieu of a repetitive refrain, rockets to a soul-cleansing, cobwebs-clearing climax so fiercely orgasmic you need a cigarette to regain your bearings.  Now there's some genuine heat swirling around the song -- enough so that Epic re-released Boulevards last week with extra tracks, an increasingly common industry practice that continues to just rankle me, if for no other reason than I'm enough of a lunatic to plunk down money twice for the same motherflippin' record, and that's what they count on, but if it helps Augustana become the raging success they richly deserve to be, all will be forgiven."
1,I'm sick of this song!! It's overplayed...Can you people stop loving Green Day so much. They suck.
2,"oh please, however catchy the beats are do not call her music hip hop,for some one who has been listen to it for years, calling her music hip hop is an insult"
2,"AFTER LISTLENING TO THIS CD A COUPLE OF TIMES AND WATCHING DR. KNOW PLAY WITH BRANDON CRUZ I THINK THAT THIS CD IS WORTH EVERY PENNY.IF YOU CALL YOURSELF A DR. KNOW FAN AND DONT OWN THIS CD THEN YOU SHOULD SLAP YOUSELF RIGHT NOW.IT DOESNT MATTER IF ITS NOT KYLE TOUCHER ITS STILL DR. KNOW AND THEY KICK ASS AND BRANDON CRUZ IS A COOL GUY.ALSO THE METAL STUFF THAT KYLE DID KICKS ASS TOO, IF YOU ARE A FAN THEN YOU SHOULD CHECK THAT OUT TOO"
1,"It's incredible how a band with so much potential and a great debut could follow it up with such a dud. There is close to nothing capitvating or engaging on this record. The songs feel like poor B sides to the original album, and while nobody ever claimed them to be geniuses they WERE catchy, but even their keen pop sensibility is pretty much lacking here. Slightly amusing for one spin, but in the long run utterly fogettable. Not even worth your time to illegally download."
5,This is one of my most favorite CDs in the history of the universe. Great on rainy days...and sunny days...and medium days too. Its good allll the time. :)
2,"Powerful voice. Mimics the styles of a variety of classic Hispanic singers.  Incredible range of material.  But, unlike Lhasa de Sela or Astrid Hadad, she leaves me flat"
5,"I JUST GOT 1 THING 2 SAY.THIS NI**A PASTOR TROY GOT GA ON LOCK.IF U AINT FEELIN HIS MUSIC,U AINT FEELIN NOTHIN.HE GOT THA TIGHTEST BEATS,AND THA TIGHTEST LYRICS EVER"

5,"the most amazing EP you will ever come across.  so much emotion flows through this album, tears come from my cd player every time in amazement.  do yourself a favor and buy this album, you will never ever regret it. "
4,"This is a solid rock album. But it's not as good as their previous effort &quot;Spiritual Machines&quot;. The sound has more bottom to it (thanks to Bob Rock -- or no thanks?) but at the same time it isn't heavier, which is strange. At first I was very disappointed with the album (I have all their previous recordings), but it eventually grew on me. However, if this is a new direction for the band, I don't know if I like where it's going"
1,"Wow so in history class they told me because of its racist themes and such that minstrel shows are long gone but they obviously haven't heard THIS trash.    Sheesh, where do I even begin?  You thought Fiddy was bad?  How about Chingy?  Lil Jon?  Nope, they're not nearly as bad as these wastes of flesh.  These guys are a disgrace to the black race, Aaron McGruder is totally right (creator of the Boondocks) if Martin Luther King Jr. did somehow get resurrected he would definitely scoff at the state of Black America, perhaps it was a tad exaggerated but it still made an excellent point.  Afterall it was Chris rock that said, ""There are black people and there's n***ers!""  Then everyone in the audience laughed their *sses off because it's true.  Unfortunately these guys fall in the latter group.  Don't give me that rubbish on how it's just the music, no way folks, this goes far beyond the music itself.  This is a reflection of the sad state our society is in.  Ok people you want to talk about the actual MUSIC?  We shall then, but these cliched annoying 'beats'  lack so much substance that I'm just wasting text space talking about the 'music'.  The lyrics?  They bring new meaning to the word STUPID.  So there you have it, this logic pretty much applies to all their cds and anyone else like them (the aforementioned rap degenerates) they really take the cake for Retards of the Decade when we talk about ""I Love the '00s"" in 10 years.  By the way check out the Boondocks, it's a great comic-turned-cartoon, it's very fresh and unique"
2,"BEP was one of my favorite hip-hop acts of the late 90's. Their Debut album ""Behind the Front"" and even their Sophomore album ""Bridging the Gap"" continued a musical approach and ideology more akin to Tribe Called Quest, Talib Kweli, De La Soul, and the Roots than the current Gangster Rap trend.  After this however, BEP apparently figured out that they can make more money with intellectually depraved dance tracks than they can with original music. And it's a shame.  Money Business is a perfect example of an album crafted from bottom to top for pop appeal. In 2004 (with Elephunk) BEP left the Artistic music community and joined the commercial music community. It was sad to see them go"
1,The mere fact that this album is popular is enough of an argument for letting terrorists bomb this country into oblivion.  The Black Eyed Peas have re-defined what awful music can sound like.  These guys have zero talent and zero class
1,I LUV FALL OUT BOY!!!!!!!!!  AWL SONGS GET 10 OUTTA 10!!!!!!  DESERVS ALL 6 STARSS!!!
5,"I have listened to Kurt Bestor for several years.  His music is soulful, peaceful and absolute magic!  He is by far my favorite &quot;new age&quot; artist.  My favorite track, What child is this...hauntingly beautiful"
5,"So how about that? A Mahler second that actually moves! The result is one of the most exciting readings of all time. It's truly legend.  This is one of the two greatest Mahler seconds. Here Mehta, who can often be an oddly questionable interpreter, lightens the music at just the right level, making it brilliantly unique. Instead of allowing the music to sink into itself, like most imitations of Bernstein's classic reccording.  Music has to move, it has to speak, it has to breathe..  Never has Mahler been so logically accessible and tended for. The experience gained from this recording is greatly edifying, if not spiritual.  Technically however, its not perfect: one thing that makes it somewhat lacking. Sometimes the orchestra is not really synchronized. Precision is sometimes sacrificed for Mehta's ingenious creativity. However, to me these sort of flaws just make the piece more homely and natural.  The Vienna is of course fantastic in sound. Brilliant, but deep and always resonant.   This is some masterpiece material. A truly excellent CD"
5,"I recently saw this guy live even though I was only familiar with ""What If That Guy From Smashing Pumpkins Lost His Car Keys"". Unless you are easily offended, go see him live. You won't regret it, he interacts with the audience a lot. I picked up this CD at the merch table after his show. Lynch's combination of acoustic guitar and innocently wicked lyrics will leave you in pain from laughing so hard. I like the fact that this was recorded before a live audience, because it captures the experience of seeing him at a show. That's what led me to buy this instead of ""A Little Bit Special"". The audience reaction to the songs on ""Superhero"" adds so much to the album. My personal favorites are:  Dr. Stephen - I love the way you expect him to say a certain word, then he says something completely innocent instead. You have to listen to know what I'm talking about.  Superhero - This song is a good example of the audience interaction at his shows. I like the audience-chosen superheroes, but I probably can't repeat the names here.  What If That Guy From Smashing Pumpkins Lost His Car Keys - Catchy title for a catchy song. Whether you like the Smashing Pumpkins or not (I do), you will find this short song hilarious. It's a really great impression of Billy Corgan.  Mother's Day - Also very short, but such an unexpected ending.  Taxi Driver - Oh man, I almost p*ssed myself the first time I heard this song! It starts out as a folk song until you hear what the taxi driver said. Totally politically incorrect, but so funny! This is my current favorite track.  Best Friends Song - This duet with Mark Teich starts out friendly and quickly becomes a song about how the one friend wants to nail  the other friend's little sister. Another one you have to hear to appreciate.  I also like the bonus track at the end which contains ""Lullaby (live)"" and ""Special Olympics (live)"". Lullaby is great, and explains to his daughter ""why Mommy left us"". This album is a good place to start if you like dark offensive humor"
4,"That these songs are not already all over radio proves that radio is bad for music.  Good lyrics, great musicians, sincere, complex rock and roll that rarely sounds overdone.  Buy Air Stereo, then buy Bastards of the Beat, then call your local radio station and get this music out there.  I'm thinking Wild Stallions kind of world changing power here!  "
1,"WOW. 12 dollars for this CD. I must have seen this album in every stores 1 dollar bargain bin, and their wasn't one CD their was usually a big grotesque stack of them sitting thier"
5,"When I first heard the Rosabel Vocal mix at a club, I almost fainted. It was the best club remix I have ever heard.  And I was so worried a domestic single would not be released, and to my relief, it was.  Every remix on &quot;A different kind of love song&quot; is awesome.  You will also enjoy the remixes of &quot;The music is no good without you&quot;.     You will not be disappointed with this CD Single if your a cher fan and you love club remixes....!!!"
2,"Awesome album.  I bought it for ""Believe"" but there is not a bad song on the CD.  Nice suprise of the song ""Building Bridges"".  I was thinking to myself that sounds like Sheryl Crow, then looked in the liner notes and it was.  Good harmony with her and Vince Gil. "
2,"ok, I bought this cd and it gets 2 stars one each for the songs ""Believe"" and ""I'm Building Bridges"". The other songs are horrible. Ronnie is the lead vocalist for a VERY good reason! They were very smart to get Vince Gill(the best!)to do background vocals on Bridge's. Save your money or you too will be adding this one to your yard sale!"
2,"A Moose from California compared Audra's ""Bill"" with one done by Jane Monheit. I took his advise and listened to both. Audra sounds like a church choir singer making an attempt at jazz. The Moose from California has a tin ear when it comes to quality and soul.This is a sad recording as far as jazz goes. It should be in the cabaret bin. Absolutely!!"
1,"i've got the first several pearl jam album releases through 'no code'.  this band was just getting worse with every album.  eventually, i caught on and stopped wasting my $.  i read all the great reviews of this album and thought the first single was alright.  who the @$#%@ are these dumb reviewers?  are they getting paybacks?  is this politics or music?  live 105.3 barely played any of this album - and i should have taken a clue from that.  they still know how to play, but need some new energy and ideas to make cohesive, appealing songs.  also, maybe they need to be poor again to lift their spirits - obviously being filthy rich isn't helping!  only put 1 song on my mp3 players...= 1 star"
2,Too Lisa Loeb for me. Sorry. Maybe if someone else wrote her lyrics
2,I never knew a voice could sound that good but his does and I hope that he keeps up the good work.He has a strong voice and should be heard more often on radio.A friend of mine bought one of his CD at one of his concerts and it was the best I have heard in a long time.Your music sounds like it is coming from your heart.The one song that really stood out alot to me was Mama was alot like Jesus.I think that it should be your next release.It's a very touching ballad and I think people will want to hear more.A new and dedicated fan.Gerarda Watso
2,"Since ""Luck Of The Draw"" Bonnie Raitt or her record producers have been out to lunch. ""Fundamental"" sounds like a jam session gone bad. There is  really nothing special on this CD, except for ""The Spit Of Love"". When are we going to hear a song like ""When The Spell Is Broken"" again? Bonnie seems to have passed the female blues guitar mantle to Sue Foley and Kris Wiley. Sorry, I'll stick with her old albums"
4,"I enjoyed this album. At first glance it appears that it is your standard post-1990's rock album. But after a good listen, you realize that they have succeeded in forging a rather good and unique album. It's well done and has a good shelf life due to its distinctive sound"
4,"I found this Band while looking up information on Trixter and found PJ Farley in the band. Listened to RA on their website and bought this CD the same day.  I have not found a band lately that took me away like RA.    I have not heard the first album but it is next on my list, since I got Duality today and have not stopped listening to it!!!  RA ROCKS!!!"
1,"I bought CD because at the time, I was a huge Utada Hikaru fan. Her voice is shrill most of the time, but one can overlook that. However, after a time, her songs became boring. Her lyrics are boring too, and the average Jpop artist can write them. Ayumi Hamasaki is much, much, much, much better than Utada. If you want the real Jpop Queen, go for Ayu. If you want a shrill-voiced artist that's bland and boring, go for Utada"
5,"Miles always let the music do the talking, so my advice is just listen to this album. Nevertheless, I will bang on about it a bit, just like the others. This is a CD I put on after I come back from the pub, or club at night when I've had a few drinks or whatever. Somehow it just calls out to me ""Luke... Luke... PLAY ME"" and I do. It never fails to move me (and sometimes physically). It is a strange, dark brew of textured piano and electric piano riffs and some minimal rythmical work by Williams and Holland, with Miles gliding over it like only he can and John McLaughlin creating great atmosphere with some wonderful guitar work. It is raw, like most Miles Davis stuff, but also very smooth and peaceful - with a kind of dark streak running through the middle. Quite unlike any music you will hear these days, bar perhaps Aphex Twin. When I first got this album I thought it was incredible and powerful and was even quite scared of it for a while - it seemed to possess some kind of quiet voodoo power. There is magic in this music, definitely. But, over the years I have listened to it regularly and it continues to give me warm pleasures. Every listen becomes a rich, rewarding experience. It is a real grower, and calmer than most of Miles' other fusion work. It is a good companion to ""A Tribute To Jack Johnson"" (Mainly because of the presence of McLaughlin on guitar), although this album is far less aggressive, and more gentle and mysterious. The album will take you on a pleasant little journey down a bubbling creek, in the middle of the night..."
5,People snicker when I mention skee-lo b/c they don't understand what an incredible complete and great album this is.  This is one of the best albums I have ever bought
1,"Okay, two of history's most annoying hits are on this disc: Wonderwall and especially the endless, bloated Champagne Supernova. Liam Gallagher cannot sing, and these guys claiming to be better than the Beatles is ridiculous. Screw Oasis, buy Beatles"
1,"Like other uses have pointed out, the music are NOT conducted by John Williams nor performed by the London Symphony Orchestra, and they do NOT sound the same with the music from the movies.  You are still getting a nice collection of music, but for the REAL John Willims music, you gotta buy the original soundtracks.  These products just don't measure up to the authenticity of the glorious works by John Williams"
5,"This is one of my favorite Zeppelin Lps.  Musically, it's very strong.  You just have to respect a group of musicians who could have had a nice payday by turning out a clone of Led Zeppelin II, but opted to do something very different.    It's no surprise that critics and some fans didn't like this one, because the band refused to play to type.  But this is really a very strong session and shows the incredible extent of this band's ability to play a lot of different types of music.  There is a lot of acoustic work on this CD but a fair share of electric to please the electric crowd.  I purchased this in Lp format, complete with the cardboard ""wheel"" that turned inside the gatefold where you could match up pictures with holes in the outer jacket.   Anyone who listens to FM radio knows The Immigrant Song - what a great rocker.  They opened with this when I saw them in March 1969... or was it 1970... on the tour supporting Led Zeppelin II.  Friends has nice ""happy"" lyric but there's a sinister sounding string backing behind the acoustic guitar and conga drums.  Unusual.  Celebration Day is a typical Zeppelin rocker that has a great,frantic slide guitar introduction.  Since I've Been Loving You is one of the more powerful blues performances  - black or white - that I have ever heard and I've been listening seriously to music for about 37 years.  This track alone is well worth the price of the CD.  Stunning.  Out on the Tiles is another rocker.  Gallows Pole is a fabulous bit of work on a traditional English folk song done with acoustic including banjo and violin. I love Bonham's drumming on this track, it provides a lot of motion and propels the piece beautifully at just the right point in the song.  Tangerine is an acoustic love ballad - single material.  It's a nice little composition.  That's the Way is a sad little acoustic song about not being allowed to play with the boy next door (I think... it also seems to have an ecological message and a recognition that all that lives is born to die) - I love this tune.  Bron Y Aur - more English folk music, a happy jig of sorts about growing old with the woman you love.  Hat's Off To Harper  - contrary to a prior reviewer, this is a great blues piece done with slide on acoustic as an homage to Page's buddy Roy Harper (See Stormcock on AMazon.com)  I love the tremelo effect they put on Plants vocal.  This lyric eventually became Custard Pie on Physical Graffiti.  Page will be appearing with Harper at a show this summer (2006) playing the entire Stormcock release.  It's a bit pricey because it's an import but if you can afford it it's available here on Amazon.com.  Page is a cameo guest on Stormcock.  Knowelegeable folks know that Roy Harper sang Have A Cigar on Pink Floyd's Wish You were here.  This man has trememdous respect from musicians in Britain including McCartney, Kate Bush, Page, Dave Gilmore and others.  He's a living legend in Britain for people ""in the know"".  All of the tracks are good, Since I've Been Loving You and Gallows Pole are definitely my favorites.  Buy this at once! "
5,"One of the early Judas Priest albums, here we find Rob Halford's voice slightly different (something that would be complained about 20 years later with the release of an album with the band Two) and starting to change into the voice we hear on albums like ""British Steel"" and ""Screaming for Vengeance."" All of Glenn Tipton's and KK Downing's signature guitar licks are on here. All the songs are good (there's even a Priest classic...""Beyond the Realms of Death"") but this album is far from being their best album or even in the same league as albums like ""Hellbent for Leather"" or ""British Steel"". But, don't get me wrong. It's good for an earlier release, but other than that...Get one of their later albums first.  1. Exciter-5/5-Good drum intro. The song is catchy for the most part and Rob Halford does some great screetching in this song. 2. White Heat, Red Hot-4/5-This song's OK, but I think the part where Halford says ""white heat, red hot."" is annoying. 3. Better By You Better than Me-3/5-His voice sounds more like it did on later albums, but this song doesn't seem really inspired. 4. Stained Class-5/5-Great song! The music on this track in particular rocks. 5. Invader-5/5-This song took a while to grow on me, but it's a very cool song. 6. Saints in Hell-5/5-I like the title and the lyrics. The song has some great sounds. 7. Savage-5/5-This song is really great, Halford's screeching can't be topped on this song. 8. Beyond the Realms of Death-5/5-Probably the best song on here. 9. Heroes End-5/5-Lyrics are good (For a hard rock song).  A"
1,"A rewiver In a big music magazine wrote that this record reminded him of Bottle Rockets and The Drive-By Truckers. He must be kiddin`. You can't compare apples with oranges. I rather say It sounds like Bon Jovi were playin somekind of Nashville pop-country, like the Great Divide.  Some compare this to legends like Lynyrd Skynyrd and Allman Bros. They couldnt have been listening to the same record as me!  But If you like Shelby Lynne and Pat Greens newer stuff, lend an ear to these guys. But If you want blood, search the real thing In these bands The Lost Trailers thinks they have something In common with."
2,"Your Love by Laura Branigan is the reason that I bought this CD.  It is the only reason that I've kept it all of these years.  Her immense vocals can knock down walls at one second and caress your heart the next.  One of the, if not the most overlooked vocalists ever.  Spanish Harlem by Ben E. King, of course, is another great song but you don't need to by this soundtrack for it.  The rest of the CD is throw away.  But for the Laura Branigan song alone it's worth the money.  It's the only reason I gave this album two stars!  If Atlantic Records ever releases a box set for her, or remasters her albums with this song on either, this CD will be turned in to a used CD store &quot;Pronto!&quot;"
2,"George Benson is one the greatest guitarist of all time.  I bought this CD with the hope of hearing George Benson play the guitar with the skill and passion that most professional performers could only dream about.  George Benson did come through on two of the three purely instrumental tracks, ""Softly, As In a Mountain Sunrise"" and ""Arizona Sunrise.""  These are the only two tracks produce by Paul Brown.  The other instrumental, ""Take You Out"" is a tribute to Luther Vandross and is on the ""Forever, For Always, For Luther"" CD.  George Benson does showcase some of his talent, but he kept the song true to Luthers' rendition ""Take You Out.""  The bottom line is: if you think George Benson is a great vocalist, you will love this CD, and in my opinion, he is just tolerable.  Three instrumental tracks, seven vocal tracks, this CD is not ""Irreplaceable."" "
5,"This is perhaps, Najee's finest CD. It has real, qualitative jazz flavorings. This is what ""smooth jazz"" is all about. The entire CD is worth the price and then some. This CD is definetly worth five stars"
5,"I could say alot about this but I will only say a little because I don't need to waste time writing how I feel about this CD nor do you need waste time reading what anybody wrote! Get this CD it is to me one the most slept on album in years but don't you sleep on it, cop this joint!!! peace"
1,COMPETED SO MUCH WITH THE SPOKEN WORD.  I wouldn't be able to reccomend this for bed time at all as you have to listen SO hard to hear the words that it becomes very &quot;unrelaxing&quot;.  However if you chose to  listen to this during the day this would probably work for you
1,"Amazon's editorial review declares that it's pointless to argue the appropriateness of harpsichord music on modern piano. Okay... De gustibus non disputandum. Rather than argue, may I suggest that you listen to the same music as played by Trevor Pinnock on harpsichord. Even more aptly, you might listen to Gould's Goldberg Variations in comparison to Pinnock or Bob van Asperen on harpsichord. And if it turns out that you enjoy both, then you are a lucky listener"
2,"I was expecting (er, hoping for) something closer to ""Hounds of Love,"" but this was spacey and unspooled. I appreciate change and I appreciate disjointed ethereal songwriting, but this was a bit much for me. Some songs seem to just spin off into nothingness, others drag on and on. A few songs have much triter lyrics than I expected from her, and on most her voice seems to be rambling while disregarding the music behind it. I liked one or two tracks, but overall I cannot get into this"
4,"Jack White has done it again!  This is my second White Stripes CD (first being Elephant) and it does not disappoint.  Jack White still has that raw sound with shredding guitar and screeching vocals.  This album seems more mature in a way but at the same time, you know it's the White Stripes from the opening riff and when Jack's vocals come in.  Red Rain, White Moon, and Blue Orchid shows that Jack White loves to put color in the titles as well as in his songs as there are a few different styles.  My favorites, though, are Blue Orchid, My Doorbell, and I'm Lonely (But I Ain't That Lonely Yet).  I think I still like Elephant better but one thing is for certain - the White Stripes aren't fading away anytime soon.  I love his Led Zeppelin/Nirvana style voice and can't wait to hear his new band, The Raconteurs"
1,"Garbage! Pure garbage! Sh**! Pure sh**! The only reason she got any type of record deal is because of her looks. She cannot sing whatsoever, and her voice is terrible, and she has no place in the music industry. If you have not noticed, all her hits (only 3 of them) are all collaborations, which says a lot because she can't even sell on her own and stand on her own feet. The only good song on here is ""It's all about me"" with Sisqo. Seriously, don't waste your time or your money on this talentless slut! Grade: "
5,"I saw her in concert and the next night I drove to another state to see her again. Wow, she does sound better than her recordings. Her voice is so sweet it brought tears to my eyes. Genre? I love jazz, folk, blues... Hey, its roots. She's beautifully and purely Lizz. I can't wait till she gets back to the states. You can't hold a moon beam in your hand"
1,"Whats the song called and who is it sung by when Brian pulls up to the cafe where mia works, its like a little italian/ spanish love song, plz plz tell me i love it an cant find it"
5,"Recently I undertook the challenge of burning a ""Best Of 2005"" Smoothjazz CD.  The challenge was daunting, being limited to approximately 15 tracks.    Four tracks came from this wonderful CD.  Gregg Karukas, always a skilled keyboardist, has outdone himself with these wonderful tracks.  Track 1, ""Girl In The Red Dress"" is a fun, upbeat way of beginning this musical adventure.  Track 5, ""First Flight Home"" is an immensly sexy and driven song.  Track 7, ""Corner Club"" is a combination of absolutely haunting to so much fun.  And then there's track 8, ""Isabella"".  In my opinion the best single Smoothjazz track of 2005.  It is the kind of track, when a friend asks ""what exactly is smoothjazz?""  Play ""Isabella"" for them.  They'll understand.  Buy this CD, you'll love playing it for years to come and the artists deserve your support for putting out music at this quality level."
5,"As a newcomer to My Chemical Romance, I've been completely blown away by this CD.  That's the good news.  The bad news is that now I have to get all of their previous CDs because they're just too good.  There were quite a few CDs from my favorite bands that I was anticipating this fall, most of which were a total disappointment.  Thanks MCR, for giving us a worthy CD to listen to.  Flashes of Queen, The Killers (Hot Fuss-not the new horrible CD), Jimmy Eat World, even Rocky Horror Picture Show--I could totally envision a broadway show or movie for the theatrical quality of some songs.  Can't recommend it highly enough"
5,"Martina McBride delivers a Traditional Country Music Vocal Performance on her latest CD Martina McBride ""Timeless.""  Martina McBride covers Lynn Anderson song ""(I Never Promised You A) Rose Garden"" on her latest CD Martina McBride ""Timeless."" Martina McBride is a Country music pioneer in her own class"
1,"I bought this album thinking that it would be good...boy was I wrong! Ms. McBride did not do these songs justice by the way she sang them. Rose Garden, for example is my favorite song, and is sung by Lynn Anderson...it was the most beautiful song ever and you could almost feel the Rose Garden as Lynn was singing. Marting sang the song like it was a meaningless song...no feeling, emotions, etc. The rest of the songs sounded crummy too. Save your money and buy the orginal artist who sang the songs."
1,"This is not the music from the movie. This purchase was a Major dissapointment. You would do beter searching for the music credits for titles, then download the tracks form your music subscriber"
5,"Joshs song ""To Where You Are"" was written for his grama after her death. I just lost my grama and this was the song that was sung at the chaple.  It is a beautiful song that shows the love for a family member, I'm buying the CD, so that my grama will always be close to me      "
4,"Judging by their latest release ""A Murder of Crows"", Incubus have ditched their funk/Nu-Metal/Progressive/Poppish style for a more straight forward rock sound. And for good reason. The moniker genre they were usually placed under has long since died out, and the remaining bands that attempt to release material even remotely close to Nu-Metal usually replicate the Nu-metal bands that came before them. Lets face it, Nu-Metal is dead, and it never really was that great to begin with. Incubus was one of the few great bands that incorporated Hip Hop/Funk/Metal/Jazz and a DJ all in one package. ""Morning View"" sees the band in their most popular and at the height of their career. Now in the lime light, with millions of fans, ""Morningview"" does show the band ditching much of their Hip-Hop/Funky roots for more mature production and compostition. The vocals have become the lead instrument with the band taking much of a back seat. That is not to say that ""Morninview"" is a less-than-stellar album, on the contrary, it is an album worth owning with much to offer. The musicianship is still amazing and the vocals and lyrics are just as deep and meaningful. ""Morninview"" takes time to break into, and even more time to find the hidden gems beyond just being a ""great"" radio friendly album. Just like ""Make Yourself"" I took this album at face value and have missed much of the magic to be found in each song. Under a new light one can easily see that ""Morninview"" is one of the greatest releases of its time"
2,"After reading other reviews, I expected something a little more. Other than Gimme Little Sign, the first listen did not impress. Maybe it will grow on me. If not, my Daughter may like it"
1,"After months of searching, I found the out of print cd here.  I had never heard it, but after hearing the fabulous song &quot;My Only&quot; from the &quot;Good as it gets&quot;  movie soundtrack, I had to hear the album.  What a disappointment!  Oh well, it would have been hard to make a cd as good as that song"
1,"Steve Albini has got to be the most sanctimonious, self-possessed, pompous [person] in the entire music industry. He emerges in one hysterically pretentious band after another. He's hailed as some sort of guru by ""alternative"" people, when he's actually nothing but an uninformed, homophobic piece of ****. In the song ""Jordan, Minnesota"" he slanders innocent parents for molesting their children even though the true story is all over the net. Ever heard of research, Steve? Guess not, you've probably been too busy sleeping with prostitutes and pissing on other bands equipment (yeah, I read the tour diary). As for the ""music"", this is a record by and for people who hate music"
5,"This CD is so great.  There is such a good variety of songs on here that you will be happy with listening to it over and over again.  ""Save a horse, ride a cowboy"" is an upbeat, witty song that will make you want to get up on the table and let loose!  Well worth your money"
1,"This album sucks. The song are soooooooo boring. it's just like listening to cold play but even cold play being on drugs, because sometimes people don't do things as well when they're drunk or on drugs. So, if cold play was on drugs they would not play good music and they already suck and levy is like way worse than cold play so what that does that say about their music. It's just so bad. the guitar player needs to take more lessons, maybe from the lead guitar player from new found glory becuase he rocks. ok that's all.  Jason Mitchel"
5,"Bun B put together a great album. His flow and lyrics are always on point and he works well with the majority of his guest appearances. If anyone has something bad to say about Bun B or Pimp C or UGK, you don't know real southern rap. The only thing that will become better than this is when Bun B and Pimp C release that new UGK album!

1,"This is a terrible album.  Cocorosie is one of those bands that are fun to throw in with a bunch of other bands in a music related conversation to make your taste and knowledge of hip and independent music sound that much bigger than it really is.  The cover artwork is pretty funny and cocorosie is a cool name, the only problem is that they make music that sounds like it does and they charge people money to listen to it. "
5,"Some terrific songs are included, but there are many missing---   especially ""The Continental"" which was in the movie.  I can't finding the complete song anywhere. Why did they omit it on the CD? "
1,"This cd sucks! Nobody can sing! Andrea McCardle is a horrible annie. Reid Shelton is the worst Daddy Warbucks Ever. Bert Healy sucks too. I Hate This Cd. Please Don't buy this, I'ts Horrible! It's A Humiliation To The Musical Annie! I'm 16, and I Grew Up with Aileen Quinn as Annie. Alicia Morton is The Best Annie. If you want a good Annie Cd, Buy The Television soundtrack to Annie. Everybody on this cd Sucks"
5,"Wow, what an inspiring book.  It was recommended to me by a South African, whose ethnic background is Caucasian, that to learn about South Africa's recent history and culture, one should read this book.  This book is truly amazing and very, very informative.  The civil rights struggle for equality and equal treatment is vividly depicted.  The decades spent to peacefully open the government policies so that the citizens of the country can equally share the benefits and contribute to the improvement of their society is remarkable.  One important point is that many individuals did not share their government's oppressive policies and many, regardless of ethnic background, supported Mr. Mandela.  His ability to unite a divided country is truly inspiring.  If one wants to learn how difficult it is to live as a second class citizen, with very restrictive policies in a police state, this book is it.  We in the US are very fortunate to have many freedoms and opportunities that we often take for granted.  After reading this book, I am very thankful that we are a united country where we promote based on a person's ability to perform, not their ethnic or religious background.   Reading Colin Powell's autobiography ""My American Journey"" one also gets a good view on how we in the US can achieve based on our own accomplishments once given a open, honest, and fair opportunity to perform our job."
1,"Those Franchise Boys (name edited for proper grammar reasons) are just another reason why rap is basically nothing more but flogging a dead horse nowadays. This is simply nothing but mindless drivel. It's basically a scam for more cash, like the majority of rap nowadays. This has no value, no meaning, nothing. Just a bunch of n*gg*rs rapping about the most ridiculous stuff to date.   Buy anything except for this"
1,"Shevonne the imperial hoodrat or whatever you claim to be.....you wouldn't know about being a hustler if Ice-T slapped you with your tampon. Its painfully obvious that you don't have any music knowledge due to the fact you enjoy ignorant, inbred, klown music. I am sure you do relate to the lyrics because you definitely have the iq of a tree frog. And no I will never reach that level.......or should I say sink to that level because I never move backwards with my intellect only forward.   Dem Wack boyz are one of th worst groups out there to date.  Support real emcees like Mos Def, KRS-One, and Immortal Technique"
5,"I'm astounded at the number of people that think that an upbeat lovesong like this is supposed to be sung with a voice that conveys angst.  Gritty is putting it mildly, the album version of this song sounds like Chad Kroeger has bronchitis.. curiously enough it sounds very similar to an audio file that's been run through a heavy sound compression codec, which is to say distorted and overall harsh.  I'm certain that this is the version that Santana would have wanted on the album, but Alex Band of the Calling just isn't as big a name as Chad Kroeger of Nickleback, they needed big names to sell it.  So they recorded this altogether better version to play on the radio and in the video to make people think that's what they were getting on the full CD, then pulled a fast one and delivered the bronchitis special edition instead.  On the other hand as the other reviews have suggested, if you liked the album version, if you honestly believe that a love song is supposed to be sung with angst.. and.. er.. grit..  then the CD single is probably not for you"
5,This cd is by far my most FAVORITE Kenny Chesney CD of all time! I love each and every song on it. Even the bonus tracks are fantastic! A must have for the country music fan!!!!
5,"Madman Across The Water.  Wow! This is an essential Elton John album.    By now, most are familiar with the opening track, Tiny Dancer.  Beautiful piano and a melodic falseto set the tone for this, my favorite Elton John tune (and I have many!).  Levon and the title track are also two huge standouts of this album.  This is less a collection of singles with filler as E.J. has been accused of creating later in his career.  Taken as a whole, this album is simply a masterpiece.   Madman was created before the flashy Goodbye Yellow Brick Road days, with all the pomp and ceremony that came along with it.  Here's you get the feeling of a new artist, hungry and clawing to get to the top of the pack.  He's succeeded with this effort and hasn't looked back since.  If you're a partial E.J. fan and are looking for some of his slightly more obscure work, Madman Across The Water would be a perfect and thoroughly enjoyable choice"
4,If you love Mozart you will really enjoy this CD. In my opinion Sir Neville Marriner & the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields  performs Mozart better than any other. The only problem I have with this CD is some tracks on the first CD are recorded live. I have never been a big fan of live recordings. An occasional cough is heard on track 4 which makes me cringe. If only they passed out cough drops that evening I would have awarded this CD five stars. Otherwise the music is simply sublime. Robitussin anyone
2,"The reason I can never fully like this album is because of what it created in it's wake, the ""float on"" kids. I've been listening to modest mouse since when they began and I am disappointed going to a show and having a thousand kids scream at the top of their lungs for that song. If you listen to any of their other stuff, you will realize that it sounds nothing like original modest and they have made their first ""mass produced"" superhit. The album has it's moments with ""blame it on the tetons"" and ""the world at large"" but ""dance hall"" and ""satin in a coffin"" bring it down. If you enjoyed listening to modest mouse before this cd came out, don't buy it. You will be disappointed"
4,"Ciara does not have a pretty voice. Her single ""Goodies"" mislead everyone to think the CD was bumping, but that show in the hell was not true. This album has about 10 or 11 songs that are actually good. The following songs include... Goodies, Hotline, Oh , Lookin' At U, Ooh Baby, Next To You, And I, Other Chicks and The Title.I gave this album 4 stars and it show in the hell don't deserve it. Can I Get A Witness!Has anyone besides me notice that Ciara can't dance and sing. Everytime she perform this hoochie can't hardly breath. i guess they call that ASTHMA! Ciara do me a favor. Next time you bring out a CD, you need to breath, stretch, shake and let it go."
1,"Anyone looking for the song ""You're Just What I Need"" featured in this movie can find the song on the CD ""More Than A Lot"" by Rufus King.  It's a very hard-to-find CD because the band didn't have a label but I found it on cdbaby.com.  Don't know if it's still for sale there or not but the CD is worth it"
5,"Art of Chill 2 is an amazing divergence from traditional relaxation CD's.  Whether I'm looking for background sounds while reading, entering the relaxation zone or focusing on positive feelings, this 2 CD collection has become a favorite of mine.  I'm a musician and have not been a big fan of electronically created drum or melodic sounds, but when I heard this CD I was attracted to all of the tracks immediately.  It's not too often that you can find an artist/CD where everthing on it has an impact on you.  While playing the CD's working in my office I'm able to focus my concentration and satisfy my never ending craving for new and creative sounds.  If I want to relax and calm myself I've been able to do so with the sounds on this CD set.  Jon Hopkins is a clever musician and taps into some captivating rythyms, chord progressions, melodies and lyrics.  I enjoy listening to this CD as it is my number one relaxation technique on plastic.  Very captivating, and you'll definetly chill; don't pass it up."
1,"Anyone who buys this CD thinking it has something to do with harp music is going to be very disappointed. There's nothing of the tranquility and serenity of the harmonious harp here. What you get is rather percussive and at times repetitive pianoplaying, seemingly based on random chords. The sort of stuff you don't want to play for more than ten minutes. Buyer Beware"
5,"Wow! The more I listen to this CD, the more I like it"
2,"ok. i thought from other reviews that i would really like this cd, but I dont really. the delivery seems completely pretentious as another reviewer said. i cant get past that fact. though damn shame is excellent. its the only one that i added to my playlist. in fact i promptly trashed the rest."
1,"OK, I guess after 30+ years of generally spectacular music diamonds, everyone is entitled to plunk down a lump of coal.  That's just what this CD is..a dull clunky lump of coal.   I've been listening to Bonnie for most of those 30+ years.  I still have Streetlights and Home Plate on vinyl.  For the past many years, I didn't even listen to her new music before purchasing.  I just bought em!  There were always bound to be a couple ""popular"" hits and more than a couple undiscovered diamonds on in the tracks.  Not so for this CD.  I Will Not be Broken is acceptable...the rest of the tracks sound almost off key and in some places, even out of tune with herself.   Bonnie is still one of my all time favorite singers - but I wish I would have saved my $$ and not blindly purchased this one."
4,"I understand that many of you who have bought this CD will be Broadway lovers (and I am one myself)and you will be used to the lead roles having amazing powerful voices. But just as important as good singing is good acting. I think that Ann interpreted Roxie as a wannabe who had the enthusiasm but lacked the talent, which makes her raspy tones and sing-speak completely plausible. It also supports the theme that you can use other things than talent to get yourself to the top This may not be the way you like Roxie played, but you shouldn't shun Ann's interpretation. It's a good thing if there is more than one way of having a character played, I think so anyway. Personally I love the Miramax film, but I enjoy comparing these 2 and seeing the differences"
4,"Being a fan of The Divine Comedy since they released Casanova in 1996, I was really looking forward to their latest album. Much like a lot of previous releases by The DC, this album takes a few listens to fully appreciate it. When I first listened to it, I was disappointed with most of the early tracks and didn't listen beyond track 7. However, repeated listens have definitely added a great deal to my enjoyment of this collection. Track-by-track:  1. To Die A Virgin - Amusing lyrics, but the melody doesn't do anything for me. Opinion seems to be very divided on most of the tracks here, this being no exception. It sounds a bit flat to me.  2. Mother Dear - An unusual country track with a catchy melody, but a far too repetitive chorus. Musically it's great, but the constant repetition of ""Mother Dear"" quickly becomes tiresome.  3. Diva Lady - Not bad, but hardly the strongest of melodies penned by Neil Hannon. Annoyingly it sticks in your head - I'd rather it didn't!  4. A Lady Of A Certain Age - Beautiful melodies, wonderful instrumentation, and moving lyrics. I've always liked Hannon's voice, but this is the kind of track his singing is best suited to. Stunning.  5. The Light Of Day - A bright, upbeat melody, again with some beautiful instrumentation - strings and harpsichord really add to the classical rock style that the DC have always done so well.  6. Threesome - A charming 1 minute piano instrumental that provides a good break in the middle of the album.  7. Party Fears Two - Elsewhere I've hear people calling The Plough pompous; if any track sounds pompous, it is this one. I haven't heard the original but the strings are overdone for a riff that isn't all that special. The chorus is better than the verse, but this just sounds out of place here.  8. Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World - This one's quite odd. I didn't expect to like it at all but it really grows on you. Great lyrics, a very enjoyable melody and plenty of decoration around the various melodies. Very well composed indeed.  9. The Plough - As I mentioned earlier, I couldn't disagree more with the notion that this track sounds pompous. It's an absolute masterpiece. A wonderful build-up in each verse and throughout the track. A similar feel to The Certainty of Chance or Freedom Road, this is one of the best tracks I have ever heard from the DC.  10. Count Grassi's Passage Over Piedmont - The opening melody links well from The Plough. Great melodies throughout, an unusual mix of spoken/sung lyrics, not dissimilar to The Booklovers - but much easier to hear more than a few times over. Very special, and unique!  11. Snowball In Negative - Yet again, the orchestral arrangements are superb. Interesting contrast between the vocal sections and the piano solos, showing that Threesome wasn't such an anomaly after all. The ending is a little unexpected and slightly drawn out, but this track wraps up the album well.  Apart from the first few tracks, this is possibly the best DC album I've ever heard. It's right up there with Promenade and Fin De Siecle and is a welcome reminder that Hannon is highly unlikely to lose his touch anytime soon. Beautiful"
4,"For his ""2nd"" solo album (even though this as well as ""Life in 1472"" have guests on most to all of the songs), JD did a good job.  I'm not a huge fan of his but this album is solid.  Guests are mostly to thank for that, as well as some great production (that he always seems to pull off).  Of the 13 songs on here (it does have a lot of skits/interludes) 1 is a classic, 1 or 2 are near classics, 4 are ok, 1 I skip, and the rest are good. For those who have heard JD before, you know what to expect, songs about women and flashing and flautin his money, nothing new.  Production is also good, JD takes part in 11 of the songs (he produces 1 and co-produces 10) and Swizz Beats & Neptunes each do a song.  I'd recommend this album for his fans or fans of that kind of rap.  #2 - 10 (CLASSIC -- great beat -- f/ Ludacris -- also onone of his albums) #3 - 8 (f/ UGK & Manuel Seal) #5 - 7 (f/ Boo, Gotti, Usher, R.O.C.) #7 - 9.5  (f/ Jadakiss & a good hook from Freeway -- nice beat) #8 - 8.5 (f/ Nate Dogg) #9 - 7 (f/ Bilal) #11 - 9.5 (great beat -- f/ Manish Man) #13 - 8.5 (f/ Nate Dogg, R.O.C., Trey Lorenz, Katrina -- nice beat) #14 - 8 (f/ Clipse -- also on their ""Lord Willin"" Album) #15 - 9 (f/ Jagged Edge -- great beat and story) #16 - 7.5 (f/ Kurupt, Field Mob, Eddie Cain, Backbone) #18 - 5.5 (f/ Da Brat & Kandi) #20 - 7 (F/ Xscape)  Jermaine Dupri -- b. 9/23/73 -- Atlanta, GA check all my review"
1,"Hey, didn't you have a girlfriend who liked this guy? Remember driving around, another Sat nite of getting nowhere, hearing this guy, ""Maggie May"", thinking, ""didn't they just play that already?"" Remember beer-soaked carpets, butts and roaches lying around, stoned and drunk and bored? Remember the stories about this guy getting hauled into an ER at four in the morning in New York or LA or someplace, what they pumped out of his stomach? Is is still around? Does somebody still listen to him? Hey, is this the same guy as Joe Cocker?"
4,"I think this is one of the best films I've seen in this life. I always wondered what they did to represent a date in the past as well as they did while I watched the movie. The music was a major groundbreaker in helping creating a totally nerve wrecking feeling of belonging to the past.  This is music for the mind. It seems to speak a language of its own. I didnt know that I liked scores and instruments before I heard the music of ""Road to Perdition""   Its so complete in its mesmerising process that it makes me want to salute it. Certainly the best music I've heard for any film. I liked the music to ""The Village"" too. Passion Of The Christ is another favourite"
5,"After hearing this cd for the first time, I knew I wanted to buy it.  I also bought this as a gift for a friend and she has been thanking me ever since"
1,"First, I should remind you, Dear Reader, that since italics, boldface type, and underlines can't be used in these kind of reviews, I have to use one capital letter in some mid-sentence words to slightly stress them and use all capitals to stress other words even more!       Anyway, one star on this review is one star too many to give this album and band.       I received this album as a gift for my birthday while I was on the other side of the country.  I'd never even Heard of this band until then, much less any of their songs by pure and simple osmosis.  When I finally got around to taking it out of the wrapping and putting it into the CD player of my car on the way to work and back, I was not impressed with the opening song, nor the second, nor the third, etcetera, and so on, and so forth ...       I kept wondering if this coma-inducing drone (interrupted only by the screaming of the word ""Nothing"" at least 20 times at the end of the first song) was some kind of tactical build-up by the band so they could eventually break out a song that made them at least Somewhat Big (much less a hit) to start the party.        You know the kind of song I mean, don't you, Dear Reader?  I mean the kind of song that makes you think ""Whoa!  Who's THIS?!"" because it has a either a great opening, or a great first line or four, or at least Something to grab your attention within the first minute, like Ani DiFranco's song ""Out of Range"" would do in less than 16 seconds.       Anyway, MANY extremely torturous minutes later, the 9th song came along (ironically for me, it's called ""Wishful Thinking"") and I honestly couldn't take anymore of this DRIVEL!  I gave this band A Whole NINE TRIES to make something that at least Resembles an impression and all I got was only Slightly less musical boredom as when I did when I once tried to listen to the only bad album I currently know by Tangerine Dream: ""ZEIT"".  That album, by the way, was basically four 20-minute bits of what seemed like people in an orchestra tuning up their instruments and eventually matching one single note with each other BEFORE the conductor starts a symphony you never get to hear.      As I said, this album is only a micrometer less boring.       I honestly cannot understand how anyone who scouts for the music industry could have happened along this sorry excuse for a band and thought to themselves ""WOW!  These guys are On FIRE!  I must get them to the studio and P.R. them IMMEDIATELY!!""       Let me put it this way, Dear Reader: Remember that song ""Next Time I Fall In Love"" by Peter Cetera and Amy Grant back in the mid to late 1980's?  In comparison to the so-called songs on this album, that cutesy ballad will sound more intense and energetic than ""Paranoid"" by Black Sabbath.      Maybe Wilco got their record contract by winning a contest of who could bore an audience the quickest.       Oh, and if you're wondering to yourself, ""Oh yeah? Well,  let's see this guy (as in ME) make a Better album!""        I already Have made a better album and I'll gladly show it to you.  Leave me a response to this review if you want that proof.  AAAaaannnnnd ... CUT! That's a wrap"
1,"Darryl Worley's ""Have You Forgotten"" begs another, more relevant question -- ""Do You Read the Paper."" Despite the fact that Hussein's Iraq had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks, he justifies our illegal invasion and occupation of that sovereign nation with references to the Twin Towers. To xenophobes like Worley, the Middle East is just one big nation of indistinguishable brown people. He justifies our warmaking with cliched references to ""our freedom,"" apparently oblivious to the irony that the Patriot Act -- passed in reaction to 9/11 -- has effectively cancelled the Bill of Rights. He accepts the Official Version of 9/11, despite the fact that the story has holes big enough to fly an airplane through. I've heard some pretty reactionary stuff on country radio before, but this song definitely takes the cake."
1,Come on.  I cannot play these dual discs in my car nor any regular CD players. J&MC are excellent though
4,"Technically,this is New Edition minus Bobby Brown,Ralph Tresvant and Johnny Gill. Brown,by 1990 when this album was released,was enjoying a successful solo career,especially from many sales of his second 1988 release DON'T BE CRUEL. Tresvant released his self-titled debut also. So the remaining three NE members Ricky Bell,Michael Bivins and Ronnie DeVoe became Bell Biv Devoe. You can see on the album cover that one member has the official NE logo on his sweatshirt. These guys started their musical careers as typical R&B artists in 1983(Jackson 5 clones,vocally). And now they're ""hippin' and hoppin'""! NE released their debut CANDY GIRL in '83,the self-titled album followed the following year,and between then and 1988,released three more albums."
2,I was thinking along the lines of the daughter father duo of Nat King Cole and  daughter. This was some what not up to what I was looking for. Skip it
2,"poor album. the song 'rocks' is almost identical with any songs of Black Crowers, and even they look alike.and i can't believe is Primal Scream i'm hearing. Primal Scream really has something better to do"
5,"Jon B. returns with his sophomore efforts with a more relaxing feel with Cool Relax.  11 of the fifteen were either written or co-wrote by Jon and seven of the fifteen were produced by Jon B. himself.  With hands on experience, this release becomes more personal and touching for its listeners.  For the most part, ""Bad Girl"" has the fastest tempo and blended well with the direction of the LP.  Hearing Jon reach for the higher notes on ""Can't Help It"" was a good display of talent and range as it is altered throughout the song for an appealing tone was quite impressive.  The title track was more or less a jazz tune with an upbeat drum track.  2Pac was featured with equal time on ""Are You Still Down"" as he almost stole the show until near the end where Jon B. flexed his abilities.  ""I Do (Whatcha Say Boo)"" is a song about being in a relationship for some time until he finally pops the question of being married.  He then admits how his woman makes him want to stay home instead of hanging with the boys on ""I Ain't Going Out"".  The inviting ""Can We Get Down"" is seductive as the question itself as he questions his desires to be with someone sexually.  Hearing Jon croon in another language on ""Tu Amor"" sends this album to heights of a climax indeed in tuned with the title.  There's nothing missing here except maybe the company of someone to enjoy this with"
2,"Where the hell is the melody, the song? Just fragments of invention that rarely gel into a work of art. I think Wayne is playing the role of Miles, but has not controled his men in the same way. -think I'm crazy? Listen and judge. j"
1,"If you happen upon the video for MakeDamnSure and the sound on your television is off, then you would think that the band Taking Back Sunday is ripping one hell of a energetic and explosive tune.  They look like the MC5 in the video, jumping off amps, winging guitars around there head, looking serious as all hell.  But if your like me and you turn the sound back on, your going to hear that it's another whiny and droning effort from the emo machine designed to make kids in high school feel self important.    I was asked to listen to this by one of my friends.  I gave it an honest to god listen, but I couldn't handle it for too long.  Being earnest is fine, but stop with this emo stuff.  You'd think after the fiftieth clone of the same band that eventually the comsumers of this stuff would realize that it's all the same. If you like emo, please, buy 13 Songs by Fugazi.  They practically invented the genre, but I actually buy what they do.  I don't buy this crap, this is just the same drivel that i've been hearing for ever.  Avoid at all costs. "
5,"VH1's We are the 80's introduced me to this wonderful album. The video for ""Running up that it hill"" captured my total attention. I was very delighted to find that the extended version of this song is also included as an extra track. The rest of the CD has multiple and diversified musical surprises. Overall and keeping in mind that this is a recording from the late 80's it is worth the price."
2,"I got these CDs based on some reviews, but I can not take the singing.  There are far too many little kids singing, and the adults are no better.  It is WAY too gimmicky.  If you want just traditional songs sung nicely, this is not the set for you!  I am going to copy the songs I like and make my own CD - I think there are maybe 2 songs per CD I'll use!  BAD"
1,"Well, the Young Gunz basically suck.  Their lyrics are very weak and wack and the choruses they come with are extremely lame.  They also have very generic voices and flows which make for a boring listen.  The production as a whole is decent at best.  However, this album is 100 times better than the atrocity that is Memphis Bleek - 534.  But it's still not good. JayZ needs to clean the rap house and get rid of these 'guys' that call themselves rappers.  He should keep Kayne, Sigel, and Freeway and then cut the deck and start recruiting.  Young Gunz & Memphis Weak just don't have what it takes to carry simple songs let alone the entire Roc for years to come.  Please JayZ for the sake of the Roc's good name...get rid of these tag along bums bringing it down.  1 star"
5,"this album was everywhere around the time i was entering my senior year of high school,and for good reasons too.this album is so raw,hard edged,chilling and gritty.it has a verry dark sense of urgency,and ghetto desperation.  it even has undertones of the occult like the mr quija song.also songs like no surrender(wich has a sick chorus!)deal with the frustration that inner city youth has with law inforcement(wich seems like another gang in some ghettos).and the song is layered with hardcore rebelious lyrics.especially from wish bone of all people when he talks about the cops arresting him and he says   ""Puttin' me on my knees, tellin' me move and I'm dead, 'cause I'm killin' all your b*tches, turnin' them blue suits red. And then I'm comin' to that funeral to shoot that b*tch up, because I know that's where y'all b*tches is bound to meet up. Cop killas, all up in they chest, and I know what to do with that vest, man Twenty-two shots.  I killa. You don't wanna f**k with Bone, nigga. And it really ain't sh*t to pull a trigger on a copper, 'cause if I go down, some of y'all goin' down,  'cause I'm goin' down poppin, so motherf**k all coppers, Let me catch you slippin', nigga, bet I pop ya""  and the title track creepin on ah come up gives off the vibe of young inner city desperation.especialy in the first verse verse by krayzie bone when he says  ""Woke up this morning with the thoughts of Robbin' a bank to get rich, ain't ate in days so it ain't no thang to click click b***h, gimme yo s**t.""   also lazie bone's verse echos the same sentiment   ""See, I'm sittin' in my room, and a nigga feelin' down, steady thinkin' 'bout how to get paid. Gotta gauge at my waist that be  spellin' out murder that'll get a nigga locked the cage. Lay my head to bed, start to thinkin' hard, money is the cause. What can  I do me for? Need to hit a lick, not a bullsh*t, but a real lick, like robbin' a jewelery store.""  those verses pretty much sums up this album,so do the verse where bizzy bone said he took his conscience and fried them (with weed) after he robbed someone.  but lets not forget the hit singles like thugish rugish bone wich is bone's signiture song along with tha cross roads.and who can forget for the love of money song wich has great verses from flesh-n-bone(whom is arguably the most overlooked memeber),and the late great eazy-e.  flesh-n-bone- "" Gotta get on the grind Pop in the clip of my nine And b*tch if you slip You hit the chalk and fall in the night time Gotta get mine Ain't takin no shorts or no losses Hop on the phone Callin' my nigga sin at home Polishin' that MAC-10 crome Gotta a lick so bring yo sh*t Cause once again it's on To the dome with a fifth of burb we wig to the curb so we swerve And rolled out to pick up the triple six thug And follow the murder for robbin the dopehouse Smoke jump outta me bong So high, now comin' to slay with four grenades and a gauge I'm a play, watch all 'em fall in the grave and lay Pullin' in the driveway, Wish spotted the place and quickly rolled up Bulldozed through the living room Hopped out of the car and started to blow up Buck, Buck, and a kaboom Me blew all them bodies all over the room Them doomed""   bad ass verse from flesh lol,eazy-e comes hard too with this verse  ""Standin' on the corner straight slangin' rocks Aw sh*t! Here comes the muthaf**kin' cops! So I dash, I ducks, and I hides behind a tree Makin' sure the muthaf**kas don't see me Now my fat sack of rocks hell yeah i stuffed 'em  Police on my draws, i had to pause And yeah, it's still muthaf**k 'em Now my game is tight, tight as f**k is my game Easy muthaf**kin E or Eric Wright it's all the same  Now niggas might trip on how I stash my grip I gotta have it b*tch For the love of this sh*t MUTHAF**KA!!""  what a great verse from eazy-e,and its one of my favorites by him.  i also love the bass heavy down for my thang and i like how the song fades out with bone harmonizing the chorus as the song fades out.the intro with the quintet harmonizing along with down for my thang made me understand the relevence of the term HARMONY in the groups name.and after hearing the aformentioned 2 songs i kinda got the style and the jist of the group.  and in turn i couldn't wait for their follow up.because their sound was so melodic/smooth yet hard edged and hard as nails.it was unlike anything i heard before.i will admit though i too wonder how good this album would have been if it was a full LP instead of a EP.but ""as is"" its a great rap album that gives you only a taste of whats to come from this underrated but legendary group"
5,"YA SHOULD GET DIS CUZ ITS GOTS DA BEST SUPER PRODUCES PAUL & JUICY, DIS CD IS NOW A CLASSIC AND 1 OF DA BEST CDS THEY EVER MADE,YA KEEP LOOKIN OUT FOR FOR MORE FIRE CD'S DAT ARE GOIN 2 COME OUT LATER DIS YEAR LIKE- PROJECT PAT CROOK BY DA BOOK DA FEDS STORY, BOOGEY MANE OUT OF DA CLOSET, LIL WYTE 3RD TIMES THE CHARM,AND YA KEEP LOOKIN OUT FOR THREE 6 MAFIA PRODUCTION FOR OTHER ARTISTS LIKE CHINGY, NELLY, ALI & GIPP, LYFE JENNINGS, GLC, 8BALL & MJG AND THERE  ALSO PROLLY GOIN 2 WORK WITH JAY-Z IN HES NEW CD, ITS REALLY GOIN DOWN THREE 6 MAFIA ARE ON TOP OF DA GAME! DEFEAT DOES NOT EXIT IN DIS CAMP"
2,I bought this album because I liked her version of Underdog Victorious on Mountain Stage in Winter 2005.  I was disappointed with the version of Underdog Victorious on this album.  Her singing on the Mountain Stage show seemed more energetic and heartfelt whereas this album version seemed flat in comparison.  The album in general just sounds like a really young Sheryl Crow
5,"This is a great CD. It is not quite as good as Quality, but it is a mix CD so you can't expect it to be. The raps and rhymes are great. I think Ms. Hill is one of Kweli's finest songs. The only problem is the beats are a little sub par for Kweli, but still a very good album anyways"
4,"Wow I just don't know where to start with this album.Well, about the album itself: I think this is best explained by the band, so here's what they think- ""How Strange, Innocence"" was our first attempt at an album. We recorded it in January 2000 in Austin: recording took two days, mixing one day, mastering one day. Altogether we pressed 300 CD-R copies of this album...We had been a band about seven months when we recorded these songs. A lot of feelings (excitement/confusion/glimpses of visions/waking dreams/inability to play instruments) went into this record, but we didn't quite know what to do with those feelings, none of us had even really been in a studio before, and it shows in the recording, the songs show it, too--it's a young record. There are no tricks in it. There's a lightness in a few of the songs that we probably won't reach again. It sounds strange to say that instrumental songs are about something, but to us these songs were/are about such things as a couple walking through the park on a winter day, a child playing on 70's shag carpet, the story of a boy hero leading a revolution against the tyranny of the coal mines. We've had a bit of a love/embarrassment relationship with the record. At certain points along the way several of us wanted to buy back all the copies and burn them. Listening now to this album, it almost seems like a different band composed of four different people. We finally feel okay in re-releasing it, probably because we've now made a couple of records that are recorded better and that are closer to our visions for them. Anyway, we truly appreciate anyone who is interested and listening. Thank you.""  That was on the CD itself- hope you found that helpful. I like this CD for two reasons. 1.The wonderful way Explosions in the Sky can tell a story through their instruments. 2.This album has a distinct sound- one all its own. If you didn't like Explosions in the sky before, you will once you listen to this album. -Sherman. "
1,"Yes, this is the great PBBB's 3rd album, but it's not the CD you should be buying.  This domestic CD was released in 1989 and has never been remastered.    The import 2CD version of this title (backed with the PBBB's 4th ""In My Own Dream"") is the one to get.  It was remastered in 2004.  Ditto for ""The Paul Butterfield Blues Band"" & ""East West""; the 2004 import 2CD is also remastered (and sounds incredible) and the domestic CD's are not.  Why WEA and Elektra have not made these four remasters available domestically is a mystery.  Don't waste your money on these inferior versions: Get the imports"
1,all this dude does is release bubble gum garbage songs like whatyou know about that etc. well mr ti what you know about rap. cause ya sure dont get any lyrical skills i hope you dont think you are going to make people think you are king of the south with garbage like this
2,"I bought this album due to the song ""Soak up the sun"".  I was dissappointed when it was the only good song on the cd.  I still believe Sheryle Crow keeps it real(Just not on this album)"
1,"As a big fan of the Postal Service (their ""Give Up"" easily makes the cut on my top 10 albums), I had high expectations for this Dntel record, as Jimmy Tamberello is one half of the Postal Service. BIG mistake. Listen to the samples: if you like what you hear, then buy it; if you don't like what you hear, don't make my mistake of thinking that the songs get better beyond the 30 seconds given. Worthwhile songs on this CD: 1)""(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan"" (The Postal Service remix is available on iTunes, and is a better version than what's on the CD), sung by Ben Gibbard of Death Cab and Postal Service. 2)""Last Songs"" is if anything, relaxing. I recommend getting these two songs on iTunes and leaving it at that, save some money.  The CD's too expensive for two decent songs.  Jimmy Tamberello has another digital project that he works called Figurine and (more recently) James Figurine, it's essentially a catchier, poppier version of Dntel, more in line with Postal Service"
5,"Excellent work from a local band from my own hometown.  Very unique stuff to say the least - I know of nothing that compares.  Though you should check this out if you dig Hank III's new album, or vice-versa.  Dark Country at its best"
5,"this album stands as stong as it ever did the original joe jackson band was far more tallented than they ever got credit for.but here it is One More Time,Is She Really Going Out With Him and the great Sunday Papers .yes they maybe a little dated but these were great times.you can hear it in the music"
5,"I thought ""Delirium Tremolos"" was the ultimate display of Ray Wylie Hubbard's style & talent, then I listened to ""Snake Farm"". Wow! I didn't think RWH's essence could be distilled down any further after ""DT"", but with ""Snake Farm"" I was hooked from the first riff & didn't come up for air until the cd changer kicked in at the end. This stuff is 100 proof Hubbard. Honey, it's all good, down to the last drop"
5,"My mother gave me this CD over a year ago and I couldn't find any feedback about the album. The album wasn't in the stores either. Whomever compiled the songs did an excellent job and it touched me like his 1st album did. I played it so much that the CD player scratched it. Fortunately, Soulife is out now and I can purchase it to support Anthony. Anybody that loves his 1st will love this one and Ain't Nobody Worryin' as well. He is a must see in concert"
1,"I GOT THE ABOVE TITLE FROM ANOTHER VENDER AND THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO SEND THIS ONE AND THIS IS ABSOLUTLY THE BEST ROCKABILLY ON RECORD/CD.  COLUMBIA RECORDS WAS NOT KNOWN FOR THEIR ROCK AND ROLL IN THE 50'S AND IF THIS IS NOT ROCK AND ROLL I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.  GET THIS CD AND THE COMPANION ""AIN'T I'M A DOG"". YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU DID"
1,"not what I was expecting from him. Everyone out there knows Boney is a fantastic saxophonist. However, this album left much to be desired. I wonder why he left Paul Brown, his former producer. He released some excellent albums with Paul brown. I don't think he's doing well enough on his own. I did not find any track particularly mind-blowing. If anyone that really knows boney doubts this, perhaps you ought to listen to ""seduction"" and ""sweet thing"" before making any comments. This latest album is nothing compared to those two. woork harder boney. I would not advise anyone new to Jazz to buy this album."
2,"if you knew me, you would probably know that i love punk music....old epitaph bands tickle my fancies greatly..they days when epitaph was THE punk label..you know, the label with all the re-mastered classics, plus phenomenal newer acts   anyways, until recently, this whole new emo/screamo thing was getting on my nerves...mainly for the reason that it was being labeled as ""Punk."" yes, this compilation still contains bad religion and pennywise..which is great..i mean i would never buy this for just 2 decent songs and i still pretty much hate new emo, but i can respect epitaph records now that they ditched ""punk o rama"" since they contain very little punk.   epitaph has a great extension in Hellcat Records to appease the punks/skins...i would surely recommend that someone pick up the ""give em the boot"" compilations if they want punk rock.  now, the only thing i really despise epitaph for these days is the fact that they have so many classics that are out of print and near impossible to find!   bottom line, if you want punk go to hellcat, if you want new emo and other oddity musicians come to this, the new phase of punk o rama. 2 stars because i dont really care for this, but it earns my respect"
1,"Yo, don't take this the wrong way because I'm not a hater but rather a big biggie fan. But this album is terrible. Its nothing but easy money for greedy producers by using old Biggie verses and whipping up new beats. Biggie certainly didn't leave very much unreleased material unlike Tupac then again I suppose he wasn't expecting he was going to die. But they still shouldn't do s*** like this. If you want to support Biggie's legacy this year which isn't a bad idea, pick up one of the classics - Ready 2 Die or Life After Death."
5,After watching the parade of nations in the opening ceremony of athen s 04.... I had to buy this CD... is amazing....
1,SAD THAT PHIL WENT THE WAY OF POP DIVA...HORRIBLE...MAKES ALL PROGRESSIVE FANS CRINGE...SHOULD MAKE ALL MUSIC FANS CRINGE
5,This is a no-brainer... it's Sesame Street songs... every kid loves 'em. Nothing bad to say at all... your kids like Big Bird? Get 'em this CD
5,"There are people out there listening to the radio. They want to be rescued. Long since tired of riding dirty on a honkytonk badonkadonk that makes one want to la-la, there are some that would argue that Y2K was really the day the music died. (If not even sooner, but those folks didn't like Nirvana, Alice in Chains or Soundgarden. Go figure.)  Well, anyone who's heard ""Gentlemen"" or ""Congregation"" or any other record by the Afghan Whigs should be yelling ""Rescue me, Dulli!"" And on ""Powder Burns,"" Greg's delivered the goods.  Possibly the most soul-infused yet forward-thinking rock record since the Whigs' ""Black Love,"" the new Twilight Singers record still shouldn't be construed as an Afghan Whigs album without the name. Despite Dulli wearing lead singer shoes, which definitely aids in stamping any project with a signature raspy-throated, tunelessly-endearing sound, the backing band and instrumentation are a far cry from the rabies-inflicted punk animal that was the Whigs. Sure, it's dirty, dirty, grungy blues-rock, but one might be surprised what creeps into a song here and there. ""Bonnie Brae"" is a melancholy headbanger that could almost be called blue-collar shoegaze. Piano and violin pepper tracks like ""There's Been An Accident,"" while rushing, watery electronic influence is lovingly splashed here and there, most obviously on the intro piece ""Toward the Waves""/""I'm Ready.""  Of course to think ahead, people usually end up looking back to see how good music was made in the first place. Dulli liked smashing Beatles riffs around on his covers record so much that he's taken to purloining lyrics, too, reframing the timeless refrain of ""She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah"" with a derisive sneer and a cranky guitar din (""Forty Dollars"").  Not every word on ""Powder Burns"" is an homage, however. Lyrically, Dulli has always struck me as a singing Charles Bukowski. Sometimes it's exactly who you need to hear from to fall asleep at night when you're too bleary-eyed to read"
5,Received the CD in a timely fashion. It was just what I wanted
2,"Johnny, what happened? A very whimpy John Prine, not the ""Sam Stone"" biting commentary I remember when. I bought this thinking I'd give Prine another chance. Unless he turns around on that road he's starting down, it'll be the last chance I give him"
1,Don't Buy it. Be warned. It's stupid. You will regret it is the worst possible thing that has come to musicals and hopefully will be the last
5,"this album good. me like very much.if you no like it, go f*** yourself. if you no like it, you suck more then me english. Actually, my english is not bad at all. This album is great. The beat can be memorized until doomsday and Eminem kicked a**. But Bizzare stunk,except he was pretty good on one track. But Bizzare's crappy voice and flows does not screw up this album. Go buy this album now. When you hear it, you will go crazy over it. If you don't, the Devil is ready to welcome you into hell."
1,"I was just going to write another on of my moronic reviews, but i couldn't stand anything about the album.    I hate good charlotte, they sound EXACTLY like every other prep-rock band (fall out boy, my chemical romance, simple plan ect.) I could tell simply by comparing the name of the album to the ""song"" names that this had nothing to do with life or death, and considering their preppy reputation that there would be no hidden meanings withing the songs. After i listened to a couple of these so called ""songs"" i turned it off, and quickly threw it out of the window.        My point being, with bands such as this, don't expect anything hidden within the title, or the music. It will just be a boring listen the entire way through. If you were looking for an album that DOES have meaning, and is fun to listen too. I suggest eating your own exrement"
5,"With Stanley Road Paul Weller has managed to prove to his fans and his critics that he is still an important musician even in his solo days. He hasn't written 12 good songs, instead, he's written one great album. A factor in any great album is the overall feel that perpetuates each song, making them all feel as though they deserve their place and complimenting the songs that come before and after them.  A mostly guitar driven album, Weller fuses good solos and riffs with his usual effective lyrics, often ending a song with a long instrumental that gently ushers in the next song, which gladly and competently carries the album along. However, there is the occasional song that primarily uses the piano evoking another great feel. Though these songs are quite different from the guitar based ones, they seem to come at just the right points in the album so that, not only are they a nice change of direction, but also they effortlessly fit in.  Stand-out songs are 'you do something to me', 'broken stones', 'the changing man', 'I walk on gilded splinters' and of course the title track. To truly appreciate this fine album start at the beginning and just let it play on to the end. It far outweighs the sum of its parts, and as these parts are so good, you're in for a great journey."
1,"I love hip hop and anything that has a beat to it and I liked 'It's goin' down' when I heard it on the radio. However, I just listened to sample tracks on amazon for this cd and came across 'Dope boy magic.' When I heard him rap about 9/11 I was immediately turned off and enraged. How could he rap about something that tragic?! Does he think it boosts his image or will sell him more records?! Hopefully not! This is disgusting! I hope anyone that wants to buy this piece of crap listens to 'Dope boy magic' (and more than likely others too, but I didn't stick around to listen) before purchasing to see for themselves what a SOB this guy is."
5,"When I first heard ""The Dollar"" on the radio, I was floored.   Not only by the touching lyrics, but also by the traditional sound.   I could tell that the guy singing it had a deep love for traditional country music, and was someone who stayed true to his roots.  After listening to this album, I still say all that.  THE DOLLAR is a great traditional country record.  Sure, there are the contemporary ""redneck anthems""--""Rebelicious,"" ""Redneck Side of Me,"" even to an extent ""Keepin' Up With the Jonesin""--but they are still better than a lot of their cousin songs.   Johnson's true country gift, however, comes across in other ways.   The enjoyable ""Flying Silver Eagle"" is one of the countriest songs I've heard in a long time (""I couldn't put my past behind me, so I put it in a song"").   ""She's All Lady"" is a touching tribute to the woman at home, and ""Back to Carolina"" is a powerful number.   ""My Saving Grace"" is an ode to the power of blood over alcohol (""Daddy passed out with his demons, Mama passed the offering plate...Daddy kept the Devil off my back by taking up His time"").  The CD ends with the stirring and inspirational gosel number ""Lead Me Home.""  Jamey Johnsom, from all appearances, seems the direct musical descendent of George Jones, Hank Jr., Merle Haggard, Waylon, and others--he's a traditional-leaning artist with what may come off as attitude, but what is really, in fact, simple honesty.   THE DOLLAR is one of the best country albums I've heard in a long time.  Yes, yes, he's the guy who co-wrote ""Honky Tonk Badonkadonk,"" but for true die-hard country fans, Johnson is more likely to be remembered for the tunes he recorded here...and any more he gets the chance to record in his career.   His voice is undeniably country, his writing skills are formidable, and his taste in traditional country music is unwavering.   God--and the music industry--willing, Jamey Johnson will have a long career ahead of him.  Lord knows, he's the right man to give country music a much-needed injection of traditionalism"
2,"After reading such good reviews, I decided to buy the CD.  Only to discover it is not my kind of music.  This is like a kindergarten kind of music. "
5,"When will Elfman get his due credit. The man is one of the most versitile composers of his day, and has not been awarded a thing. Personally I think that Nightmare before Christmas was his best. But Corpse Bride was fantastic. He know how to fit into Burton's visions perfectly"
1,"""A Collection of Short Stories will go down as one of the best debut albums of any band."" That, I'm afraid, is a real review...someone actually listened to this and decided that it is so good that it deserves to be ranked among the greatest debuts ever weezer - the blue album led zepplin - self titled  creedence clearwater revival the cure the pixies  queen red hot chili peppers sublime the violent femmes death cab for cutie  houston calls ....one of these bands are not like the others, one of these bands just dont belong.. truth is, I heard this cd before I even listened to it.  This style is hackneyed and killed. It's been so long since a genuinely good band has been seen as cool that even the critics are starting to forget what good music sounds like.  ""200 miles that sure is far""...thats a real line on this cd. but whatever, this is what amazing is these days..this is where generations of integrity has brought us in music..its a lost cause because in the end i guess it really is all about the dollar.  The music industry is one of the most unstable industries out there. no one knows how they are going to look financially in the next ten years..so what  do they do? they take the quick cash in..they sign crap like this that no one has to think about. easy music, easy dollar. building a band is too much of a risk these days..now instead of building them and improving them, they produce them..autotuner, cut and paste music...so sure this is a great cd and everyone needs to check it out because we all need to chip in on drive thru/rushmore's new escalade with chrome hydrolics..at least the rap industry is honest about where the money goes"
2,"My daughter asked for this cd after seeing it advertised on nickelodeon.  While most of it is fine, specifically the Veronica's song talks about spending the night with a guy and giving him the ""ride of his life"".  Not really what I had in mind for my 9 yr old"
5,"The futuristic vibe they get on this album is outstanding. Intelligence is Sexy is a great song, so is Tears Have No Name and Espirit De Corps is outstanding. Every other song is very solid. The vocals have this vibe that no other band creates, the vocals are nearly alien in nature. If you like metal songs that get into a groove and keep it buy this album. They are kind of, in a weird way, an actualized Voivod for the new century"
2,A friend of mine told me that this was a great cd. Now i do like they might be giants but this is crude compaired to Flood or Lincon. Which were much better     Only about 3 song are any good. Skip this one and get Floo
5,"Screams & Wisphers is another great CD from Edwin McCain and his band. The song Couldnt love you more is a great song for lovers that have ever had doubters about there love, Edwin McCain is in my opinion one of the best singer song writers out, the way he makes you feel the songs and stories with his words is something only true artist can do. Not a big radio artist but that keeps him grounded and not caught up in the HOLLYWOOD sell out that so many of these so called artist give into - A great cd by a great artist and worth twice the price the sticker has on it, nothing Edwin McCain puts out is bad, if your a true fan of REAL music youll love anything Edwin McCain puts ou"
1,"Other than Heavy Metal Drummer, this album is totally mediocre. This album is perhaps the most overated, overhyped alternative album of all time. I do not see what all the fuss was about. I guess that sums up Wilco for me in general. I could not name another song on this album because none of the other tracks are worth remembering. Download Heavy Metal Drummer off a paysite and skip this album at all costs"
5,"I fell in love with the cardigans when I was 10 with ""Lovefool.""  At the time I liked the mindless bubblegum quality, but now, 9 years later I'm (amazingly) still in love with them, though for different reasons.  They grew with me, I guess, and when I think of the music of my childhood, the cardigans are it for me.  It's crazy that after listening to them for so many years I still enjoy them so much, but their music just doesn't get old.  If you're debating, just try it!  at first the blatant pop my get on your nerves, but I like it because it's.... unapologetically pop.  try Dressy bessy if you like the cardigans "
1,"This CD just goes to prove how great of an influence David was on Pink Floyd's music. Out of the box this album is layed back an colored with many subtle textures, it's mellow ambience transports you to dreamy mindscapes. I found the more I listened to it, the more I liked it"
2,"Frank Zappa had a title that is apt for this Norman Brown cd; SHUT UP & play your GUITAR !  Pop arrangements, lots of vocals, and drum machine. No Jazz here.    He is an awesome guitar player, and I really like his earlier cd's. Do yourself a favor and skip this cd"
2,It seems as though the smooth jazz artist are trying to attract the r & b listener.  The cd was done in poor taste and the songs lack creativity as well originality.  Too many vocals.  I would rather here him play his wonderful guitar.  I love Norman Brown but it seems as though he just through this together
4,"this cd is mad nice....  this is mr lifs first offcial lp..  on this one, its a concept cd that talks all about gov and a person tryna live in the system of society and life in america  its takes a few listens to understand it all, but I mostly enjoyed this one....  its not as consistant as ""emergency rations"", which i belive is his BEST work cd...thats my only problem with it....   other than that...if yall like backpacker/politcal rap.. frab this one and akrobatik's balance cd="
5,"Japanese singing is cool to listen to. It is an elegant language that sounds really good in combination with the synthesized pop style..(not synth pop mind you, but keyboard drums and all).  I am sure that if it were done in english, I would look at it the same way I look at britney spears..."
1,"They couldn't let children sing about the ""pelvic thrust"" and had to change lyrics, so what's the point of doing the Time Warp again! ;D And that AWFUL cover of Ghostbusters makes me hurl! :"
1,"Of course I purchased this without previewing any of the songs because it's ""Brad Paisley.""  What a mistake!  Really bad song writing! Bad Song Selection for an album! Horrible attempt at humor and I'm wondering if Little Jimmy Dickens will continue to get speech therapy on all of Brad's albums.  I'll be selling my copy of this new CD.....it's junk"
1,"I have been waiting on 2 cd's for almost two months. I am yet to receive ""Journey of a Gemini"", or ""Blue Collar Music"". If possible, can I be reimbursed, or sent another copy of each cd. Please let me know. Thank you. "
5,"To tell you the truth, I can not find words to explain why this song is so amazing. The first time I heard the album version, I was like ""Why choosing clocks, phones and ABBA samples for a first single? What is Madonna thinking?"" After buying this single and hearing it loud at home, I could not stop dancing (specially the Stuart Price Remix). There is a feeling of ""Leting go, forget your problems, feel free"", not easy to describe everytime you hear it and dance to it. Even after, you will find yourself saying ""Time goes by, so slowly, so slowly, so slowly..."
4,"Great remixes. Not her best, but it ranks up there with her best!! :"
5,"Should have had promotion and been released a lot earlier in memory of the late rapper, great cd, got that ol' school rap fee"
1,"Not terrible, but I don't get the hype.  To me, it's just New Wave Disco-and Disco was bad in the 70's.  Finally, what's this doing in a ""Power Pop"" category?  No freaking way is this remotely Power Pop!  What a disgrace to Power Pop lovers"
5,"As a boy , I hated all country music, because my father hated Rock'n Roll.  But I knew that Hank Williams was something special.  I bought his 40 greatest several years ago, thinking that this was the ultimate collection.  However, for some reason, when this 10 CD collection came out, I bought it.  If anyone thinks Hank Williams was one of the greatest preformers ever based on his hits, YOU NEED TO HEAR THESE CD's.  His versions of songs such as &quot;Cool Water&quot; &quot;The Old Home&quot; &quot;Rocking Chair Money&quot; and many others make his hits seem tame.  These recordings are masterpieces"
1,"this album was pathetic. eminem's first 3 albums were classics. this album, eminem doesn't know what to rap about."
5,"What more is there to say about Danny Elfman's Batman score?  It's one of the most popular and well-known scores of all time.  Thousands of people have written their opinions of it.  What more can I say?  I can say how it affected me personally.  It was the first movie score I ever bought, and it was brought to my attention from my dad when we watched the film together as he said ""listen to this music in the opening credits Riley"".  Since then, my score collection has expanded 400 times, and my life and filmmaking career have thrived because of it.   What can I say, really?  I can't continue to bore you with pointless anecdotes.  I can say that this music is incredible and still in my top 5 of all time.  It's Elfman's best work.  It's heroic, it's dark, it's thematic (I dare you not to whistle the Batman theme when this CD is over), it's operatic, it's over-the-top, it's action packed, it's brilliant from start to finish.  There isn't any wasted space on this album.  Elfman has a job to do, and does it with rarely elsewhere seen success.  He practically created this idea of a ""dark superhero theme"", and while the movie was a slight dissappointment, this CD continues to thrill people of any generation. What can I say?  This score is a masterpiece.  End of discussion. cheers K"
2,I bought this cd many years ago and just now feel the urge to write a review.  I was so disappointed.  I mean the original versions of these songs are good but after listened to half a disc I felt remixed out.  The remixes become boring and just left me thirsty for the original versions.  Also did not like the way the songs were broken out.  One disc is supposed to be mellow and the other is supposed to be jamming but after listening to the disc I wondered why songs appeared on the wrong disc.  There is no flow on these cds.  I am still waiting for the proper greatest hits while this one gathers dust.  Not recommended
4,"I'm pretty new to these guys, figured I'd take some time to dig into German goth since goth is pretty well dead here in the US, by which I mean all the pioneers from the 70's or 80's are either gone, changed tracks, or sold out to that crappy early 90's House Tekno sound.  These guys have a little of that crappy House sound that you would expect from about 99% of the so called German Goth bands now a days (and sadly now Skinny Puppy as well), but it also offers a lot of new an original beats which I can really sink my teeth into, also some of it does kind of tug at the ol' psych a bit, which is a good thing, but it is no where near as amazing as Skinny Puppy was in its glory days...  ...everything pre-process, though the process was still ""pretty good"" for the most part"
5,"I liked the other BRMC albums a lot as well, but I think those had that quality where they were initially catchy and you loved it and thought it was the greatest thing ever, but after a few listens it got kinda tired...  Still good, but you'd think ""oh yeah...""  Howl is the opposite.  It was OK the first time I listened to it, and I kinda liked it, but it didnt really dig it's claws into me.  For that reason it didn't get pulled out of the CD wallet all that often.  Then I put it in one day and thought ""ya know, this is actually pretty good.""   Then I started listening to it some more and thought ""man, this is really, really good!""  Guess what?  Now I love it...  This is definitely a creeper CD, as in - it creeps up on you (yeah, that was a stoner analogy.)    I think ""weight of the world"" is the best song on the CD, but ""howl"" had really grown on me too - but I don't want to harp on the songs too much, this is an album as a whole.  Bands grow up and change, and I'm glad to see that BRMC has done it, and done it well.  They haven't lost their muse or gotten ""softer"" just to try something different -- they've grown and changed and their music shows it.  I remember my freshman year in college when Achtung Baby came out and there were people saying stuff like ""boycott U2 cuz they're sellouts!"" - not realizing that AB would be looked at as probably the most insightful, clever, and musically interesting album of their catalog.  That's what the backlash to Howl reminds me of -- shortsighted and not entirely accurate.    Yeah, people may fear change, and admittedly, some artists try it and look like complete idiots in the process (Chris Gaines, anyone...) but BRMC has actually grown, and if you liked their first 2 CD's I'd say give this one a shot.  It's really good - and I'm proud of 'em for making it.   "
1,"I don't want to hear any more of their music on the radio. It is all just nonsense, and none of it should have ever been made. They are one of the worst hip hop acts in recent memory"
5,"I wasn't a Sarah fan in 1999 when the ""Mirrorball"" tour came through my backyard, where ""Mirrorball"" was recorded live, at Portland Oregon's Rose Garden.  But I had become a fan, and was at her show, when she came through with the ""AfterGlow"" tour.  By the time ""AfterGlow"" was out, I had just discovered the original Mirrorball CD and DVD, and up until the release of this 2-CD set, the original ""Mirrorball"" live CD and DVD were my ""most played"" CD and DVD of my whole 700+ various artist collection.  But even before finishing the first CD of this 2 CD set, I know that I had to have another copy for the car.  Sarah Fan?  You must buy this now.  I promise you won't be disappointed.  It is the full show, with all of her interactions with the crowd, and the sound is better than either of the previously released Mirrorball CD and DVD titles.  I love live music, and this set is a dream come true.  Sarah is a true performer ""live"", and I think is actually at her best when performing ""live"".  Absolutely amazing recording and performance on this newly released 2-CD Full Concert Live set.  And if you get a chance to see her perform, pay whatever it costs to see her show"
4,"If you are looking to add to your beatles collection be forewarned.  This is not your typical Beatles fare.  It is however a good deal better than fair after you get past trying to peg it as a Beatles album.  Its Lennon.  He's pissed off.  He has a lot to say and he says it all on this record.  He sings these songs like he has wanted to sing them forever but was never allowed.  He breaks these songs out like they are part of a therapy session and he doesnt turn back.  This album on 1st listen is a bit of a disappointment to me.  On 2nd listen you know what its all about and you dont listen for pop hits, you listen for the album as you heard it the first time.  The only way most people will enjoy this album is after a few listens especially if your going into it with a preconceived notion.  Also a lot of songs on this album have a rocky start and then pick up steam in the middle.  This album is ultimately very good once you know what your getting into.  Its Lennon breaking the chains from the Beatles and really from himself.  After the 3rd listen, it immediately made sense to me.  Now i cant put it down"
2,"except for Ray of Light, which is one of the best pop songs of 90s, the Power of Goodbye, Beautiful Stranger and Deeper and Deeper. Where are the remixes of Don't Cry for me Argentina, or You Must Love Me or the remake of American Pie? The half of the album is full of silly ballads and R&B-scented numbers like the rubbish It's Human Nature, the sleep-inducing (but mean to be a good ballad) Take A Bow which is the same with all Babyface songs, Bedtime Story which is the same as ever with anything Bjork has done in the past and so-so Secret. Frozen seems to be a nice standout but it doesn't feel sincere, and more or less sounds like Power of Goodbye... and the Music album was one of the worst albums Madonna crapped out so singles should not be different.  All in all, Madonna is not a slow number singer; her voice terribly sounds weaker than her dance numbers and that's why this greatest hits album was not successful as Immaculate Collection because the singles were already bad. This album reflects the spiral-down of Madonna through 90s to 2000s (except Ray of Light where she struck gold) where she hit the bottom with American Life and has not recovered herself. Go buy Immaculate Collection, Ray of Light album, down load one or two other songs at your disposal and you will have the good things Madonna has produced among the heap of redundant mass called pop music."
2,"NOTE: I bought this CD a while ago, the tunes were mediocre. Then again I'm probably biased because I don't really like rap a whole lot.   Buuuut, what made me throw away this album you ask?  The guy is a racist, who uses this record as a soap box to talk about how evil white people are, and how they're out to screw him over at every turn. Seriously, listen closely, and I counted at least the first 4 to five tracks are sprinkled with racist lyrics. I despise bigots who may have had one or two bad experiences and then turn around and see fit to spit rhymes about how white people are keeping everyone down. I don't care what race you are, don't be hating on races just because you have a selfish, racist streak in you.    In ""Jesus Walks"" he talks about how we need to defeat racism...well he keeps harking on it. But he won't stop whining. I agree with him, racism does exist and it is a very real problem. However people like him play victim and make millions of dollars off it. I shouldn't have to listen to an album and feel bad about being white, or black, or any other race. Such themes litter the album and take away from its supposed originality.   Additionally, why does he even think that he is worthy to call upon Jesus? The track following ""Jesus Walks"" he talks about getting falacio (I'm trying to be PC, not that it matters). I'm no prude...most of the music i listen is laden with ""foul language"". The guy is a hypocrite to an insane degree.   He raps about the same stuff. And its not different then most other rappers out there. He's really not original at all. Over and over and over again: Look at me I'm important, feel sorry for me. Its like the emo of rap, the Linkin Park of rap.    The guy is a megalomaniac, narcissist, self absorbed racist, and I won't be buying anymore of his music.   SUMMARY: Musically its ok, nothing really orignial. Just Ok if you like rap (a genre I'm still trying to get into). The guy is talented I'll give him that.   Lyrically its a joke. He's a fake. If that stuff matters to you. But if it dosn't, then ignore this review....or ignore it because you don't like my opinion. "
1,"This is a joke right?! I honestly thought this group was a hiphop parody group at first because I figured nobody could be that bad on purpose. These British rappers are hiliarous, they basically talk over a beat and it doesn't even rhyme half the time. I got given this cd for free and I still want some money back"
4,The albulm is a Bomb. It's a must have in the library
4,"this is their forth album,it came out in 1999 when i was 12,my boy aaron kept playin this album and  i got annoyed and i asked him if i could borrow it and he let me hold it and then i can see why he kept playing it,the beats are addicting,this is when mobb deep started to go a lil commercial not too much but they still kept it real,its not ass dark as hell on earth or the infamous but it shouldn't stop you from listenin to this album,this is a good album but its not the same as thir ealry material,also for mobb deep or qb fans y'all should check out the murda muzik movie,it was supposed to come out back in 1999 but kept gettin pushed back,so it finally came out in 2004.recommmended for fans  of mobb deep,qb hip hop,ny hip hop,late 90's hip hop.standout tracks are streets raised me (reminds me of junior high school days when i used to live in ny),what's your poison (featuring cormega,he murdered this track spittin that fire),adrenaline (nice dark organ sample),quiet storm (brings me mad memories),thug muzik(produced by alchemist featuring the infamous mobb),the realest (produced by alchemist featuring kool g rap,one of the illest collabos),usa aight then, it's mine (i used to play this song a lot),and quiet storm (remix featuring lil kim).also mobb deep y'all should bring it back to murda muzik beats wise or hell on earth on your next album"
2,"I was extremely disappointed by this album. It just didn't grab me at all like Fallen did. It has no outstanding tracks or anything much memorable. I guess Nightwish has spoiled me. Before, Evanescence was about the only female-fronted band I cared to listen to. Now that I have discovered Nightwish, Evanescence just seems useless. Sorry, but I just don't care for it"
5,"Buy this CD. The songs are excellent,as per usual. This CD is more rock, with the same enjoyable dispostion... to quote from track 6, Decatur St. ""I'm one of them sad boys who's hypnotized by girl's who walk the walk...""or track 5 The Killer.... ""I want you to burn me til I feel it..."" ... need one say more"
5,"This cd is as cool as they come.  Simply smooth all the way through.  I love every song here.  If you are thinking about getting this cd, stop and go get it.  You'll love it.  Ta ta.."
1,"I had heard a lot about My Chemical Romance, both positive and negative. I decided to pick up a used copy of 'Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge' so I could form my own opinion without the biased input of from jaded indie hipster snobs or 14 year-old spoiled scene kids.  This record was written and marketed to deliver pop songs, and the opener 'Helena' is an outstanding one. It has a great melody that stands up to repeated listening, and the performance is passionate and convincing. The problem is that on every other song on the album, I was bored with the melodies and performances, even after extensive repeated listening [I'm talking about keeping this in my CD player for over 2 months, not just a quick skip-through]. The high-gloss production values suffocate any negligable amount of rocking power and sonic depth that the music might have had, and the juvenile melodrama of the lyrics and melodies gets old real fast when they don't deliver the pop hooks they promise.  This album does not rock. Period"
1,"I am quite dissappointed in this CD, being won over by the sound bytes that I sampled here at Amazon, which are very beautiful. Imagine listening to one of the samples presented here 20 times in a row.  The sample represents the whole of the song, which is repeated over and over and over with a solo over the top.  To me, this signifies a lack of creativity.  There is so much potential in each of these songs, but it is as if Avishai wrote 4 measures and then put a repeat sign at the end to finish the song.  Maybe my expectations were too high, expecting a Billy Childs type of song structure.  I will be looking at selling my CD so I can recoup at least a portion of my investment"
1,"I have listened to this cd, also watched the dvd, of John Fogerty's long road home on amazon. Nothing can compare to his Dvd of Premonition.I own It love it, Put it on and  makes me  rock out, With one of the best entertainers In his prime time of life.The guitars and Instruments he plays is awesome to watch a legend of great talent.His voice Is so excellent & clear.Had some friends over with John's Premonition dvd playing.It took all of us back to that time In history.They all went to amazon and bought Premonition.I know soon they will all be gone.I went back to buy one more the price is so reasonable.As I consider Premonition to be a Collector's dvd.If you see it again.Do not wait buy it while they are available. I know its a Import as most dvds are today.Mine plays excellent In audio and picture.You feel like you are sitting in the audience with John performing.Give Premonition 10 Stars.Anything after John's Premonition dvd can not compare to it.No matter how hard they try to bring back his music on a Cd or a dvd.Premonition Is the best dvd  of all of times. All the rest get 1 Star for trying. Though not coming close to what I call  my Collector's Edition  dvd of John Fogerty's Prmonition. "
4,"This CD was off the chain! From start to finish. The grooves were tight, the lyrics were full of food for thought, and that voice...that VOICE. It's a melting pot of songs from politics, to sexuality, to love, to self consciencness. She spared no one on every subject she covered. My personal favorites are Dead Nigga BLVD./Priorities/Earth/and God.Fear.Money. I didn't like the remix to Pocketbook, it was just too loud for a style like hers. But other than that, this album to me is the best she ever put out. Buy it, it's worth it"
4,"Most singers have to scream from mountaintops to be heard.  Others have to strategically position themselves to be taken seriously.  But Maysa Leak, vocalist of the underexposed Incognito, has a grace that oozes so effortlessly, that her peers must be scrambling to wonder how she's able to do it.  Her solo debut isn't going to make anyone forget about Incognito, but it's a solid album that shows that she's able to stand on her own.  The disc is a mix of jazz-laced soul that never makes leaps and bounds to make a statement (heads up, Alicia Keyes) and doesn't stray too far from her past work with Incognito. Like a kite on a windy October afternoon, it soars with ease.  Favorte tracks of mine are &quot;Black Heaven,&quot; &quot;Can We Change the World?,&quot; and &quot;Peace of Mind.&quot;  Maybe, one day, the mainstream will catch up with Maysa and find out what it has been missing for all these years"
5,"I met JV, Loki and Germs when they started Gotham Road and 2 yrs ago.  And we have been friends since.  So I wanted to check out their earlier stuff.  I like it, now I gotta check out the rest of their early stuff.  The singer J-sin at times sounds like Iggy!  Check them out!  and if you really want some good stuff then check out Gotham Road - Seasons of the Witch demo"
2,"Stick with Blitzkid because they can sing ten times better than this guy. He is also in Blitzkid actually and he plays drums...where he belongs. The songs on this cd are very well written and played, its just a shame that the singing is so forced and cheesy. I mean I know this is supposed to be 50's style doo-wop rock, but please. Better things in the genre....like Blitzkid"
5,"Faith Hill's latest CD 'Fireflies' is wonderful, not necessarily because of her choice in songs, but because of her beautiful voice.  I have been a fan of Faith's since the beginning and I must say her music doesn't disappoint.  While the songs are not as strong as say the songs on 'Faith', they are still quite good, particularly the songs written by Lori McKenna.  After hearing Faith sing her songs, I went out and bought Lori's album 'Bittertown', which is quite simply an incredible album.  On 'Fireflies' Faith masters each song and brings such a beautiful interpretation to each song.  Songs that I particularly enjoy are ""Stealing Kisses"", ""I Want You"", ""Paris"" and ""Mississippi Girl"".  I've read other reviews that said 'Fireflies' left them confused.  The album's songs do lack cohesiveness at times, but overall the album is still a must-have if only because of Faith's voice.  She has, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful and pure voices in music"
1,"This CD is too wack to have so many songs. J Lo should've just kept it below five. Her voice is thin, tasteless, and watery like powdered milk at the end of the month."
2,"Your music goes back to sucking.   Steve Earle didn't talk much about Car Wheels in his autobiography other than to say working with Lucinda was a real drag. Well, whatever. Obviously it produced incredible results and no matter how difficult she is they should look into working together again. Because frankly, w/o Earle, Lucinda Williams writes fairly boring songs and puts them to even more boring arrangements. And without Lucinda, Steve Earle does fairly generic country that is rarely worth a second listen. Together, they're awe inspiring.  Anyway, on to Essence: boring songs+boring arrangments+drugged-out singing=bad album. Trying to pimp the tracks up with production pixie dust doesn't fix the fundamental problem here: the songs are lame. In place of insight we get shopping lists, in place of hooks we get verse, verse, verse. And in place of emotion we get slurred vocals.   Such ingredients do not make for a good record.   as a side note, if you filter by ""most helpful"" you get reviewers who aren't 5-star fanboy clones and write intelligent reviews. Most of them were not fooled by this album, no matter how big a fan of Lucinda they are.  RstJ"
2,I was just overall very dissapointed.  I tried to make myself listen to this album but I could only do so a couple times before I gave up.  I thoroughly enjoy hip hop but much prefer Kool Keith or MF Doom or Gang Starr or other slightly less than mainstream artists
2,"Although I consider ""Too Much Time On My Hands"" a guilty pleasure, Styx is to rock music as Pee Wee Herman is to pro wrestling.  Many years ago, I had a guy working for me who had been a roadie for Styx in his younger days. He told the story of the night the entire roadie crew walked off the job -- they just couldn't stand to listen to the ""music"" anymore. What else is there to say"
5,"I first heard Joe Carson back in the early -70's while going through some of my folks' 78's.  At first, I thought it was Webb Pierce (on one of his best days);  then I distinctly heard Hank;  on the other hand, there was the sound of Ray Price (his Cherokee Cowboy Days).  All of these sounds came from a young kid (16 when he started performing) who should have, by every right, been the most heralded Country/Hillbilly/Honky Tonkin' singer ever; and yes, that includes even the great Hank Williams.  But, Joe Carson's life was cut short just as he was hitting his stride.  If there was a way to rate this collection higher than 5 stars, I would not hesitate to do so.  As with all of the Bear Family Records releases, this one is an outstanding collection, beautifully recorded and mixed, and a thorough set of liner notes/booklet.  Not only does this album showcase the stellar voice of Joe, the backing band (all legendary members of the Hank Thompson era) will knock your socks off.  While there are 33 songs here (3X more than most current releases), there are a few real standouts:  ""I Gotta Get Drunk"", ""The Last Song I'll Ever Sing"", and ""Shoot The Buffalo"" all showcase his voice.  And, there are a few old favorites here as well, inlcuding ""Fraulein"" and ""Who'll buy the Wine"".  This is one of those albums you have to own;  and I can assure you, you'll be shaking your head in amazement at Joe Carson's talent. A+++"
5,"Blue Rodeo, out of Canada where they are rightfully GODS, continues to fly under the US radar...what a shame, especially when one stacks Blue Rodeo against lesser talents. ""5 Days In July"" is the gemstone of this richly talented group. Combining elements of The Eagles, The Byrds, Poco, The Flying Burrito Brothers,twinges of psychedellic memories, 60's style chord work *which comes off VERY nice* and at times, vocal harmonies which bring a sweet hint of The Everly Brothers, this group, which can rock with the best or slow it down to a nice mellow, has a sound of their own. At once, the lyrics are memorable and catchy. The vocalists, Cuddy and Keelor, each bring their own qualities which never grow old with Cuddy having impressive range while Keelor brings at times, a nice raspiness with a clever edge. ""Bad Timing"", one of the great tunes off this gem, would soar on the country charts if given a chance. With the exception of ""Til I Gain Control Again"" *brilliantly covered earlier by Crsytal Gayle and later by Willie Nelson*, all the tunes are penned by Cuddy and Keelor, as are their efforts on other Blue Rodeo albums. I had the great pleasure to see/hear this remarkable group at The Ramshead Tavern in Annapolis, Maryland. They DID NOT disappoint. If you're looking for GREAT music outside the usual stuff played endlessly on formatted radio, this is a MUST! I would also suggest their DVD, ""Burning Snowmen"", which chronicles them over time. If you can, find a way to one of their concerts.."
5,"Flaming Lips have suceeded in creating their own musical world on ""The Soft Bulletin"". This cd is easy to find at most stores and often sold at a low price, so there is no real reason why you can't go pick it up right now. This record is best heard at 3 am with headphones on. Yoshimi was my first lips record, and the main difference between ""Soft Bulletin"" and ""Yoshimi"" is the production values. This recording has a big lo-fi sensibility to it. Steven's drums are always loud, boomy, and usually crackling, like they recorded way too hot. At times the record seems overloaded with sounds, and at first, I thought it would have benifited from the more prestine ""Yoshimi"" production values. It has grown on me though. I don't really understand the point of having ""Race for the Prize"" and  ""Waiting for Superman"" (the weakest track on the album) in two seperate versions. To me the record would have ended perfectly on ""Sleeping on the Roof""."
5,"Great, Cd I love it, Kelly and Lee Ryan could make a great duet,this is one of my best CD's, It's awsome, I love all the song, great job Kell"
2,"If you're like me, you got into Boo Radleys during the shoegazer era.  I loved the discs preceding Wake Up!, especially Giant Steps.  This is as far away from shoegazer as you can get.  The first reviewer here is right on as now Carr is totally doing the Beach Boys sunny harmony thing.  Sorry, no my thing.  They could have evolved more like Catherine Wheel whom I recommend highly.  Also try Ride (of course) and Slowdive"
5,"Most of Em's fans think that The Marshall Mathers LP is his best work but I beg to differ. The Eminem Show is his greatest album for many reasons. 1-He handled all the production except 3 songs (""Business"", ""Say What U Say"", & ""My Dad's Gone Crazy"") all of which was produced by the great Dr. Dre, 2-he kept all guest appearances to a minimum, 3-his flow improved greatly. The best song has to be ""Square Dance"", a song that show how well he rides the beat with ease. Let's hope Em can put out another album that can match the intensity of The Eminem Show.  Top 5 Songs 1. Square Dance 2. Say What U Say f/ Dr. Dre 3. Say Goodbye Hollywood 4. When The Music Stops f/ D12 5. Til I Collapse f/ Nate Dog"
2,"I read in Manson's bio that the singer for this band was a groupie of his. And it shows. This cd is a clean, more innocent version of Manson's first cd.   Her voice is nice and catchy, but the content wont appeal to many peole over the age of 16. This was a cd that was made to get quick appeal and then fade away just as fast"
5,Wow!  Great quartets played with real gusto and dynamism by the Prager String Quartet.  The sound is incredibly crisp and clear.  The performances are impeccable.  You won't be disappointed
5,"The series of ""Golden Age of American Rock & Roll"" released by ACE couldn't have a better end. During the past 15 years they have delighted us with a series of 10 CD's with 30 songs each remembering the Rock & Roll era mostly with minor top hits between 1954 and 1963. One reason for their tremendous success is the superb quality of all the recordings no matter from what year the original song was. Now besides these series of 10 CD's from the R&R era they have launched another 2 special editions with the same title: one with the special novelty edition and another with the special country edition. Both deserve more than 5 stars.  The song selection on the novelty edition is just out of sight! Most of the songs brought back memories from a long long time ago since these weren't available after the time they were top hits. I never found them back on what compilation so ever until ACE put them all together 45 years later. And with a sound quality better than in their original version on 45rpm. Therefore don't hesitate. Buy it together with the country edition and you will have 60 songs for utmost pleasure; 60 songs we grew up with and now with no scratches on them.  "
5,"If they had an unlimited number of stars, there wouldn't be enough room for all mine! This is a great CD with nearly ALL of my favorite Toby Keith songs! They're all super, but my favorites are I WANNA TALK ABOUT ME, THE ANGRY AMERICAN (I love that song!), BEER FOR MY HORSES (love that song next!), YOU AIN'T MUCH FUN, and SHOULD'VE BEEN A COWBOY.   Toby Keith has such a great voice! And he isn't a liberal either, might I add. (Warning: If you're a Dixie Chicks fan, you're going to hate this CD.)   Great buckle on his belt on the cover picture of the CD"
5,"One thing I love about Deitrick, besides being annointed and a great singer, is that he stick with the themes of his albums names whether it be crossroads, or lost and found every song reflects what a person maybe going through in those stages. Nonetheless, Crossroads is a classic gospel album from start to finish. It should have gone a trillion times platinum, but hey he will get his recognition in due time. Amen to that. Ok, 7 days is mainly a celebration ablum, after all God did create everything in 7 days and that is something to celebrate about, with hot and funky beats that will have you dancing all over the place. Don't get me wrong the album does have traditional church songs and content but its a bit more funkier. Just imagine ""God is Good"" mixed with ""Unity"" mixed with ""God didn't give up on me"" through a whole album. This is the best way to explain it. Deitrick my friend, you are my favorite Gospel artist and truely annointed. I thank God for you everyday, Amen to that. Thank you Deitrick for obeying the Lords will to make wonderful music and most of all I thank God for creating you to make this wonderful music. All Glory is yours Jesus! Amen and Amen. Go and Get it!"
5,"I am not a fan of the Carpenters but when I was younger (25 years ago) I knew a lot of their songs but considered my self a ""rock and roller"" without a decent gear to listen to.  With good equipment on hand now and collecting albums of my youth in SACD format, I decided to buy this one and was surprised that the remastering was one of the best I have heard.  I am a stereo only person because I do not find the hometheater enjoyable.  I tried it for 5 years (from 1991) but did not get the satisfaction I have now with my stereo equipment.  My equipment has high end sound with a medium high end price.  To this day, I have yet to hear a system better sounding than mine  (Yes I am biased!).  High end does not mean excellent sound because I tried to listen to well known brands and I could not get satisfied with the sound.  I believe the key to good sounds are the amplifier  specs that only two manufacturers still specify. Slew rate and damping factor.  One is Australian and the other Swiss.  I have the Australian brand to beat.  Speakers  and interconnects are secondary but to me, electrostatic speakers are king! SACD players that are mid range suffice"
4,"Just a bit less evolved.  The songs on this album are absolutely brilliant.  With a wide range of styles, there's something on this album for everyone - only the songs You and I and You've Got It Bad Girl are anything less than fantastic, in fact.  You Are The Sunshine Of My Life - very good, original song.  Not his best, but still good. Maybe Your Baby - an awesome groove, nice synth bass, but maybe it goes on a bit too long. You And I - not a bad ballad, nowhere near as good as Blame It On The Sun, but has its own charm. Tuesday Heartbreak - very joyful sounding song.  Good tension between the verses and chorus, great melodies throughout, and excellent drums. You've Got It Bad Girl - a bit jazzy experimental.  Not bad. Superstition - Good dance tune, very funky, with a powerful horn riff that Peter Gabriel would later rip off in 'Sledgehammer'. Big Brother - awesome clavinet tune, angry lyrics, nice melody. Blame It On The Sun - this is one of the best ballads, written, ever!  Really.  He does this kind of ballad on every album, but this is the best of them, with a soaring (or wailing) verse that slides into an emotional chorus. Lookin' For Another Pure Love - very original music, freestyle melody. I Believe (When I Fall In Love It Will Be Forever) - this is a real triumph, this is everything a song should be, with an awesome chorus that repeats 10 times at the end and you're not getting tired of it."
5,"Just by saying this has been quite a year for the veteran crooner would be an understatement in itself. Barry Manilow began 2006 with the predecessor to this time capsule by debuting at #1 last February with The Greatest Songs Of The Fifties. In between that album release and this, he has continued to sell out his Las Vegas extravaganza, Music and Passion, five nights a week. The show is so successful that the Las Vegas Hilton recently extended Manilow's contract through 2008. He picked up his second Emmy Award this past August for the live on tape broadcast of that event, and with the release of this album, he has his highest-selling tally in a debut week than he has for any other album of his 32 year recording career. Barry also holds the distinction of being the only artist of 2006 to have two Top two records in Billboard in one calendar year. When it came to recording his follow-up to the ""Fifties,"" juggernaut, it didn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what the concept would be. All it took was Clive Davis to help sort out the material and all systems were go. For the critics who have tarred and feathered Manilow since he hit #1 with his very first single, ""Mandy"" over three decades ago, you'd think by this time they'd cut him some slack. No dice. Manilow has even admitted he wouldn't know how to react if he heard a kind word from a critic, the Brooklyn-born writer, arranger, producer and crooner has always depended on the devotion of his fanbase. And it's not just any fanbase. These people are hardcore fans, dubbed ""Fanilows."" On this CD, we are treated to thirteen chestnuts that made the 60's one of the best eras in pop music history. The pop songs run the gamut of that decade offering everything from Bacharach to the Beatles and in between honest and original covers that include a sensational retooling of Frankie Valli's ""Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You,"" which kicks the disc off into high gear. Other highlights among highlights include a duet with 60's supergroup, The Association, on their staples ""Cherish"" and ""Windy"" that Barry cleverly arranged as a medley. Elvis' gorgeous 1962 ballad ""Can't Help Falling In Love"" is lusciously delivered as is The Righteous Brothers 1965 anthem ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'."" Even the somewhat hokey #1 Dean Martin single ""Everybody Loves Somebody"" from 1964 fits in divinely as Manilow gives it as much warmth as Dino did over forty years ago. Sinatra's smash hit from 1966, ""Strangers In The Night"" is so effective, Franks' daughter, Tina, gave Manilow a thumbs-up for a sensational interpretation. Other pop staples included are the Herman's Hermits ""There's A Kind Of Hush,"" Bacahrach's gorgeous song from '68 ""This Guy's In Love With You,  as well as his '69 Oscar-winner ""Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head."" The Beatles shimmering 1964 ballad ""And I Love Her"" and Bobby Vinton's 1963 ""Blue Velvet"" is just as haunting as the original while the mood on the 1962 love anthem ""When I Fall In Love"" originally a hit for The Lettermen is optimistically heart-wrenching. The album ends on a positive note (pun intended) with the 1965 anthem for hope ""What The World Needs Now Is Love."" Never was that sentiment so true - never was a Manilow album this gratifying. Everything from song selections to Manilow's masterful arrangements to his honest readings, this record is easily ranked as one of the best of his storied career. Look for The Greatest Songs Of The Seventies inside a year. It doesn't take a fortune teller to figure that one out"
1,What a total hack.  Do people really think this guy has talent?  He is ruining the genre!  Stupid me bought the CD because it seemed to be everywhere...big mistake.  AVOID
1,I dont see what people like about this CD. My 14 month old son and I looked at each other in disgust when I first played it!!! Very irritaing CD dont buy it!!! I am returning it today.
5,"A great collection of Arts solo stuff, which include his 2 brillant chart no one`s &quot;I Only Have Eyes For You&quot; &amp; &quot;Bright Eyes.&quot; There is quite a few songs off &quot;The Art Garfunkel  Album&quot; such as the romantic &quot;I Believe When I Fall In Love It`ll  Be For Ever&quot;  &amp; &quot;99 Miles From L.A.&quot;   &quot;Watermark&quot; from the album from the same name. But surprisingly  only  a a couple of tracks, from the very well put together album  &quot;Fate For Breakfast.&quot; All in all it`s a great album, with a   great selection of songs. So if you like chill out tunes, after a stressful  day, buy this album. I can guantee, it will de-stress you"
5,"I first got Believe It as a used record in the late 70's. Wow! This CD includes 2 rather short LPs, but you are getting it for the first one - Believe It! which was the single best hard-fusion record ever made. It's also a great bridge from the world of rockers dabbling in jazz (Bruford's early band, Brand X, etc.) to a real jazz outfit that happens to rock hard. I never tire of listening to this one with it's wonderful blend of Tony's great drumming, some of the best guitar work Holdsworth has ever done and just enough funk to keep it from ever getting too serious. Buy it and crank it up"
1,"This is PT worst album made. Every track on this album is bad! Lame lyrics, awful beats and there in no decent guests on this album. Murda man was a awful diss track to Lil Jon, PT has lost his game thats all. Also I wanna why PT has the beef with lil jon anyway. If you want so good albums get Trill by Bun B, Ghetto Bill Gates by Master P."
2,"I remember that just before I bought this in 1993 I was pretty fed up with the state of Guitar Playing. At the time, the gloom and doom of the latest wave had settled over the world of guitar playing like a rain cloud. This guy turned it all around for me.  I have seen and heard some of the greatest guitar players more than once but what Danny did on this album is mind boggling. The thing is, it is pure, honest, beautiful, mean, technically impressive, music. Just a box of ear candy.  If you appreciate a good guitar player than you are in for a treat. There has never been anybody whom I recommended this album to that was disappointed. "
2,"This is definitely one of the worst cd purchases i've made.  The Cd is poorly organized, and most of the music isn't as good as one would think.  the songs that ARE worth listening to though, are: Disc 1: 8. Halifax - ""sydney"" 11. Say Anything - ""Woe"" 15. I can make a mess like nobody's business - ""The best happiness money can buy"" 56. Patent Pending - ""Los Angeles""  Disc 2: 1. Hellogoodbye - ""Homewrecker"" 5. Jack's Mannequin - ""Kill the messenger"" 8. Matchbook Romance - ""My Eyes Burn""  Other than that, this is really a minimal value Cd, in my opinion"
5,"This is a must-have CD for any parent who likes introducing the simple joys of great music to their kids.  My mom and dad (both in their late sixties) enjoy listening, too, and my child can ask her grandmother about other songs from ""back in the day.""    Get the book, too!  Nicky's really big personality shines through as he rubs elbows, er-paws, with some jazz heavy-hitters.  Your child will love the photos and will also discover some great new vocabulary words like bop-a-re-bop. The CD and book have proven to be a great gift combo.    Take a listen and enjoy! "
4,"After his successful debut, Ja Rule didn't take no time whipping up his second album.  ""Rule 3:36"" spawned the hit singles, ""Between Me and You"" and ""Put It on Me.""  It was released in Fall of 2000.  Can Ja do it again and release another very solid effort or will he fall to the sophomore curse?  1. Intro - No Rating  2. Watching Me - Very Short - 4.5/5  3. Between Me and You (Featuring Christina Milian) - 4/5  4. Put It on Me (Featuring Vita) - 3.5/5  5. 6 Feet Underground - 4/5  6. Love Me, Hate Me - 3.5/5  7. Die (Featuring Caddillac Tah, Black Child & Dave Bing) - 4.5/5  8. F*** You (Featuring O-1 & Vita) - 4.5/5  9. I'll F*** U Girl (Skit) - No Rating  10. Grey Box (Skit) - No Rating  11. E***** (Featuring Caddillac Tah, Black Child & Jayo Felony) - 3.5/5  12. It's Your Life (Featuring Shade Sheist) - 4/5  13. I Cry (Featuring Lil' Mo) - 3.5/5  14. One of Us - 5/5  15. Chris Black (Skit) - No Rating  16. The Rule Won't Die - Very Short - 3/5  47.5/60  3.5 Stars  Wow I can't believe my ears, Ja Rule sold out big time!  He almost dropped his whole street style completely and pretty much filled this album with all commercialized pop-rap music.  Some of it is good no doubt but this isn't an album you can bump and nod your head to.  Good for a couple listens then probably never again.  Mannn Ja what happened to you"
2,"A lot of people are meriting Ja's credibility on all his albums because he has been able to keep his voice on the airwaves since 1998. So he released his sophomore album Rule 3:36 in Sept 2000, that is one of the worst Ja albums I've heard (not the worst, The Last Temptation takes that title).   Ja tries to be ""gangstafied"" on this album but fails terribly. Starting with the first single ""Me & You"" thinking his thug style can attract women. I haven't bought the concept in 2000, and I'm still not buying it six years later. Or how about the flat falling track ""F*** You"" featuring Vita and 01?  Or as many revewers have pointed out that he tries to boast his singing vocals on this album, which seriously damages his creditablity. How about the song ""Put It On Me"" before Lil Mo joined song. Sounds wack(er) with out her. Or how about the late Barry White imitation on the song ""Extacy"" (and thats one of the decent tracks on this album). Oh and remember when ""Between Me & You"" was highly antacipated that you downloaded the single on Napster? Well do you remember that the origonal/demo that some of you downloaded didn't have Christina Millian singing the hook, but had Ja singing it himself. Thank god that wasn't on the album.    Now there are some listenable tracks on this album that I would like to point out. ""6 Feet"" is a standout track, and is possibly the best track on this album and my personal favorite. ""Watching Me"" is another tight track, as Ja spits with a load of energy within him. ""I Cry"" and as mentioned earlier ""Extacy"" are decent at best. Other than that, most of the tracks on this album are skippable.  Overall, a sub medicore Ja Rule album. Most of the 4 and 5 star reviewers are either big time Ja Rule fans or just in love with mainstream overrated rap (""Put It On Me"" [Remix]). To me, this album is nothing else but a pop rap, falsafied thug rap album that just doesn't appeal to me. I recommend this to hardcore Ja Rule fans if they don't have this already.  Lyrics: C Production: C+ Guest Appearances: C- Musical Vibes: D-  Favorite Tracks: Watching Me, 6 Feet, Die, Extacy  Honorable Mention Track : Chris Black (skit"
5,"The songs on this album are outstanding, the writing is direct, the themes are the same ones Neil has always sung about, making relationships last over time, country living, the road.  But the way this album was recorded is probably the main reason I keep coming back.  Obviously the guitars are all melting and the amps are overdriven and the songs are free-form, but the vocals are right where I want them, and the guitars are so warm that the album never agitates me (and believe me, I've listened to some agitating music - Teengenerate anyone?).  I guess the fifth star is gained by the fact that the songs and the band are still more important than the medium, this album isn't noteworthy for its use of feedback and hot guitars, but because everything fits, in a smooth and soulful way.  Never gimmick.  Always authentic.  Neil transcends the genre again"
2,"I am originally from The Land of Ten Thousand Lakes myself (and there's a hell of a lot more than ten thousand lakes, by the way).  I am also a musician, singer, and writer of a ""country roots"" perspective (who now lives 40 min. outside NYC), who understands how crappy the business can be.   My biggest complaint about Rockie, my fellow Minnesotan, is simply this:  He and his music don't sound like they come from Minnesota, nor Carolina (his birthplace, am I correct?), and lotsa' good country music comes from these two regions.  I mean, this record is produced well and sounds generally good, but he sounds like someone who is taking the advice of all the jackasses from Nashville who say, ""Ya' gotta' sound like this and look like this; 'cause that's what works down here, plain and simple!""    Well, I think that theory is gonna' die sooner than later.  You gots guys like Djerks Bently and Eric Church who are still not exactly where country needs to be, but they are making a slight dent in the ""soccer-momming"" of country music.    Wanna' hear good country music?  Check out 10 City Run!  They are what CMT should be airing, and they are getting airplay on ""Wide Open Country"" (seriously, check out this band, and my review of them--10 City Run--for they're the real frickin' deal).   So Rockie, my friendly advice would be this: drop the affected, mainstream, country radio accent (don't replace it with a hard-core Minnesota accent, however--Fargoooo--no good), get a band that plays more than one kind of country music, and draw on the great history of music that has come from Minnesota (Jayhawks, Replacements, even Marvin Rainwater, oh, and that Bob Dylan-dude) and Carolina (too many influences to even start!) 'cause that's you, man! That's where you're from! That's how you'll sound genuine (as the one reviewer noticed how at times you seemed to be trying too hard, other times, not hard enough)!  My theory: Your hearts not in it!    You have tremendous talent and I'm pulling for you, the next album, and the Vikings--the last, more reluctantly each year.    God Speed,  Bryan  SW Connecticut "
2,Another reviewer has stated that Mark often.It's good songs.Small package.Bring home some milk ok?It gets out stains too
1,"I love The Foundations who made a lot of great music in the sixties. Of course everyone has heard ""Baby Now That I've Found You"" and ""Build Me Up Buttercup"", but they had so many great songs. I had a ten inch compilation from the early'80's with about ten songs, all of which are on this disc. They would've fit in very well with a lot of the Motown groups, although they were a multi-racial English band. I mistakenly gave this recording one star when I intended five."
2,"Like fingernails on a blackboard - the instruments, the singer's voice, the melodies"
5,"I was lucky enough to see this show three times:  twice on the Northwestern University Campus (original musical title was ""a long gay book,"") and a third time at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago.  This show is stunning.  I found myself humming melodies from the show - even though I hadn't seen it in over a year (and didn't own the recording)!  The music and lyrics have a way of staying with you.  This is a real work of art - poetry and song, based on the work of Gertrude Stein.    If you're a fan of musicals with soul, wit, and class, then you'll love this.  The voices of Christine Mild and Jenny Powers (Little Women) are extraordinary and Cindy Gold's narration is engaging and uniquely powerful.  Combine these talents with that of Frank Galati (Tony Award Winner ... Director, Adapted Script) and Stephen Flaherty (Ragtime, etc.) and you have one AMAZING musical.    Highly Recommended!!!"
1,"Get it,Buy it and own it before they do.Also you won't mind if I said this,Right?Um.. I don't think you guys should buy this album because it's not really good.I think it would be very weird if you did anyway.I don't wanna buy this album because it's really comparing the songs from disneymania1,2&3.That's why I give it one star."
1,"I really enjoy the great synthesizer sound (usually this phrase would be an oxymoron) of this film.  John Carpenter is definitely a multi-talented artist (writer, director, composer).  So, I am not in any way criticizing the music itself.  My gripe is against this particular CD release.  I was expecting to receive a CD with only the music.  Unfortunately, very few of these tracks are music only.  Most of them are music accompanied by dialogue from the movie.  If this only happened once or twice, I wouldn't mind so much.  But it's nearly every single track.  Would you buy the STAR WARS soundtrack if it had a whole bunch of dialogue on the tracks?  How about THE GODFATHER, LORD OF THE RINGS, GLADIATOR, or any other great motion picture soundtrack?  If people want the dialogue, then they will surely buy the DVD.  But most people buy a soundtrack for the sole purpose of having the music only"
2,"You have sent an e-mail inviting me to give my opinion on this item.I am sorry I cannot go over 2 stars as unfortunately there is a defect on last track of the record, precisely on the song  ""The last Rose of Summer"".Anyhow I intend to buy other Deanna Durbin's records as I enjoy very much her voice, but unfortunately the wallet is empty now. Thanks for all your help on trying to find ""Shane: a Tribute to Victor Young""but no euccess. I will try to buy another item later.   "
5,"Jefferson Airplane tried hard, on this 1967 utterly noncommercial followup to their phenomenally successful classic SURREALISTIC PILLOW. Having made RCA millions of dollars with PILLOW, the Airplane took full advantage of their newly-minted blank check to create what may be the purest example of musical psychedelia to come out of the Sixties.  Listening to AFTER BATHING AT BAXTER'S is literally a trip. Bizarrely torqued lyrics are wedded to experimental recording techniques, sound montages, and off-center tempos and rhythms to provide the listener with an auditory hallucination. Everything goes, and so it went at BAXTER'S. It was all new, avant-garde to excess, and it largely failed to reach its fullest potential.   Most art does fail, but there's no question that BAXTER'S cross-pollinated with many other performers and musical styles. The influence of BAXTER'S can be heard in ""Revolution 9"" by The Beatles, and on many other recordings of the era. BAXTER'S may have sold poorly, but it was heard by the Airplane's contemporaries, and it clearly served as a wellspring of inspiration. An aficionado's album, AFTER BATHING AT BAXTER'S is a ghost in the machine that remains haunting even today.   "
1,"How fast can you say m-i-s-t-a-k-e? Rimes, the adolescent singing sensation, covering Joplin's ""Me and Bobby McGee?"" Patsy's ""Crazy"" and ""I Fall to Pieces?"" Buck's ""Cryin' Time?"" Cryin' time indeed"
5,"If you like Nickelback and Theory of a Deadman, you are in for a treat. This group rocks! Where Nickelback's Chad punches out his lines (most excellent), Puddle of Mudd is very melodious and has a great all-round sound going. This album is absolutely their best work to date and I am excited to hear some new tunes from this awesome band. Keep 'em coming! :"
4,"You can certainly see where the band should go.  It's a powerful album in some senses, but overall, it's just good.  Pick it up, understanding that it's just good rock/grunge/whatever.  Enjoy. "
2,"I didn't like this album that much. Only songs i liked are The MC, Step Into A World, A Friend, Can't Stop Won't Stop. Just To Prove A Point song was horrible and i don't know why he tried to do a rock song. Putting Puff Daddy on the Step Into A World remix was a terrible decision by KRS. The songs were too short on this album also."
5,"This album took me awhile to get into, but it really is fantastic.  None of the songs have lyrics, it's all about the electric guitar.  Some of the songs jam, and some are more mellow, beautiful peices.  There are a couple duds that I never listen to (namely, ""Trundrumbalind"" and ""Raspberry Delta Jam-V"", and ""Up In The Sky"" I also usually skip), but the rest of the songs are fantastic.  ""Train Of Angels"" is the best of the bunch, along with ""Love Thing"" (gorgeous).  ""Time"" is also a fantastic, dreamy track, ""A Piece Of Liquid"" is relaxing and sounds like something you'd listen to in the caribbean before it goes into some cool ""night-time-sounding"" soloing.  It's impossible not to tap your feet during ""Psycho Monkey"" or ""House Full Of Bullets"",and I love the awesome playing at 1:40 in ""Secret Prayer"".  ""With Jupiter In Mind"" and ""Crystal Planet"" are great space-themed rockers, and ""Lights Of Heaven"" is one of Joe's best.   If you only buy ONE Satriani album, I first and formost recommend The Electric Anthology and Surfing With The Alien, but then I also recommend you pick up Crystal Planet, and Time Machine (not the most consistent album, but there are some here that you simply can't miss)"
5,Just like Perry Como..Doris Day does the same her Christmas songs take me back in time.. And I searched for this Album on the internet the best price was Amazon        Thank you agai
2,"What's worse than a bad cd?  ""The Burdens of Being Upright.""  I don't even know where to start.  I bought it because I really liked the first song ""Mother Mother"" (which is the only reason why Tracy Bonham even gets 2 stars from me)... and I was completely disappointed with the rest of the album.  The songs aren't interesting and the whole thing all in all is just simply not worth the money.  Unless its used and only costs like, two bucks.  Actually, when I went to to trade it in at the record store, they only offered me 25 cents for it because they have so many copies of it and nobody wants them.  And I took the quarter! If you like grunge music, there's a chance that you might like this, but you most likely still won't"
5,"I also do not understand the negative reaction to this album.  Fine, its not what many expected...its better!  Saddoes, get over it...this the Best Album Of 2006.  Their sound has matured and if its not your style move on, don't pan it.."
2,"I didn't like this album that much. Only songs i liked are The MC, Step Into A World, A Friend, Can't Stop Won't Stop. Just To Prove A Point song was horrible and i don't know why he tried to do a rock song. Putting Puff Daddy on the Step Into A World remix was a terrible decision by KRS. The songs were too short on this album also."
2,wow. i've never really been a fan but i respect their lead guitarist.He's done alot of great work... but damn this cd ain't even catchy one bit.  you can hear the pitch fixer on benji's voice throughout the entire cd... it's bad. like realllllly bad. and it's way over produced..
5,"As a devoted Jigga fan, this album was everything and above what I expected. Every track from beginning to last consist of stellar production with complex rhymes. Jay shows off his wide array skills and versatillity with backshots at Nas(Takeover), radio cuts(I.Z.Z.O), emotional wordplay(Song Cry). Highlights include ""Girls, Girls, Girls"", ""Never Change"", and is topped off with ""Renegade"" which in my opinion CONTAINS HIP-HOP'S GREATEST VERSE OF THE PAST 10 YEARS by Eminem. Even the bonus tracks would be leads for the next rapper. Jay has been called commercial, but who ever says that ain't listening."
5,This CD captures the experience of a live performance with Elvis.You realize again what a unique voice Elvis possessed and how much you miss him. I liked the CD and recommend it to Elvis fans
1,"Raven on her own is sophisticated, but cheetah girls is for little girls - cheezy! As are most of these tracks not by real artists with CDs, just kids stuck together. 2 of Jesse Mccartney's worst songs - sorry! Some Chisty C. Romano tracks. ""anyone but me"" is a gem, get her EP instead. Hayden's ""My Hero..."" is great also, this girl can sing! She's also on the Ice Princess Sndtrck (""I Fly"")which i recommend in addition to ""Go Figure"" If they let her, she has a huge future"
5,I was given this cd as a gift for my newborn daughter and it is wonderful!  I am buying it again because it is starting to skip I have played it so much.  It doesn't get old and I even enjoy falling asleep to it while I am listening to the baby monitor
2,"Mack 10 couldn't do it twice.  His first album is tight, but this one  lacks good beats.  Also, his rapping style is too lame to carry the off  beats.  The only way could have saved the album is if he would have had  alot of guest rappers and producers"
5,"This album contains the Classic Rock song ""Smokin' In The Boy's Room"" which a lot of my peers did back in High School.Back then they used to smoke filter cigarettes. Sadly these days the filter cigarettes have now been replaced with a more potent addictive drug. Anyway back to the album. The guitarist and singer of this band Cub Koda was a Wild Man of Rock who was always great to watch in action as he jumped from one place to another on stage. They don't make them like him anymore. This album ROCKS so play it LOUD and forget about the neighbours!!!"
1,"I wish I had never owned the original recording of this album because THIS ""version"" is a sorry compilation disc distributed by BMG/Sony that hardly compares to the original. If you can find the original, get THAT, for this compilation disc does not contain some of the selections and suffers greatly for it"
5,"The best country music Christmas CD I have ever heard.  I have always been a fan of Randy Travis.  During Christmas, this CD is continously being played on my stereo.  I would recommend this album to anybody who likes  Christmas music not just Randy Travis fans"
5,"I heard this CD when I was watching an indoor track meet. One of my dad's runners showed me the CD and I listened to it. My Mom bought it for me back in 1997 as one of the first CDs I ever had. It is probably the best classical music CD I have ever owned or to which I have listened. If you run cross country or track this CD is a must as it gets you going gradually, especially the song ""Titles."" A must CD for runners and anyone else who likes nice classical background music."
5,"We've been listening to this one every night for 16months, and we still love it.  The music is beautiful, not cloying or sweet.  And maybe it's just because we don't understand the lyrics, but it doesnt' get tiresome or seem condescending like so much children's music does. Not every song is a winner - there's one that's slightly annoying -- but basically, this is music I'd listen to even if I didn't have twins. Plus, as soon as it goes on my kids start nodding off.  Maybe it's just a Pavlovian response, but hey, whatever works"
5,"This is what punk is all about. Fast music, ripping bass solos, and good ... lyrics. The casualties is what hardcore punk is all about. I highly recomend this to any hardcore punk fa"
5,"great album, super tracks and nothing more you can ask for, just simply amazing album! i highly reccomend it! SCOOTER 4ever"
2,"Steve Martin has become a cultural staple in the comic community.  With hysterical films and outlandish Saturday Night Live performances, it would be obvious that Martin would be a great choice to do a comic album.  Well, in this film guys opinion, you are going to need to be a big fan of Martin to stomach this album.  His humor is offbeat, never quite following a pattern or direction.  Instead of actual jokes, he resorts to making noises on the album that I am sure are funny in person, but listening to it just comes off a failure.  His ""Cat Handcuffs"" bit is humorous, but the rest becomes obvious that somebody was looking to cash in on Martin's popularity.  I would have loved to see Steve Martin in concert during his younger days, I am sure that he would make me laugh my socks off, but it just doesn't translate well to day's style.  I am sorry Steve, but I liked your other album better.  Grade: ** out of ****"
1,"YAAAAAAAAWWWWWWNNN! Don't even bother buying and listening to this CD. Every song on here lacks emotion, meaningful lyrics, and any type of memorable melody. Standards are set so low that any untalented fool can get a record deal, sample to their hearts content, and win a Grammy. Skip this and get Stevie Wonders greatest hits collection"
2,I saw Draco on a tv show and I liked the song he played so I read some reviews looking for a CD and I ended up ordering Vagabundo.  I did not like any of the songs from that CD.  His lirics and music are not that great
5,"Texas is home to many different musical styles, and Adolph Hofner is one of those artists who seems to capture nearly every one of them in his recordings.  What strikes me is that while many would label his music as &quot;diverse,&quot; Hofner would probably have just called it &quot;music.&quot;  The fact that Hofner is not well known and celebrated nationally puzzles me, for I believe he is one of the great Texas recording artists of all time, which puts him in grand company"
5,"What an amazing DVD, not only the music is great the visual effects are extraordinary.  A definite must buy"
2,"It feels as though she has lost her energy, she has become a distant memory of what she used to be with Mecano. Still a sweet voice, the songs chosen for this CD are mediocre. Her first solo CD was good, this was is not. The music just doesn't click, the art in the sleeve doesn't click either, maybe she needs new composers, a different producer. The Pink Floyd track is regrettable, she should not sing in English, she can sing in Spanish and French but I would suggest her to refrain from doing it in English. Maybe the Cano brothers should compose her new material, maybe Mecano should make a comeback..."
2,"this not a terrible album, but it is not that good either, and this, when  coupled with the fact that there are many other bands doing very similar  things much better than knapsack, means that it probably isn't worth the  investment. i have never heard any of their other albums, but this one had  neither wonderful guitar work nor intriguing vocals, and the lyrics (which  have been called brilliant by one of the official reviewers) leave  something to be desired. the first time you hear this album, you will  probably like it, but after three or four more times all the way through, i  think you will probably be either skipping half the songs, taking the album  out after three songs, or running to your local used cd store to get some  of your poorly invested money back. it just doesn't have that lasting  quality that a great album has; this album does not leave you wanting more,  as a brilliant album would do. in short, not a terrible album but not worth  paying full price for, especially when there are so many bands out their  which are doing the whole emo-punk-pop thing much better"
5,"Yes, it is missing some good songs from ELO (I would've like to see All Over The World from Xanadu on here and Rockaria, my favorite ELO song, among others). But this is a Greatest Hits album, not a 'All the good songs from ELO' album. This isn't for die hard fans, it's for casual fans who heard a few songs on the radio and want a greatest hits album to hear some other tunes. The songs on here are great and will probably influence them to buy ELO's other full length albums."
5,"From the intimate clubs of the world to the stage at Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, Lynne Arriale continues to prove why she is the First Lady of Melodic Jazz.  I do not believe that I can adequately describe her music and that of the great Lynne Arriale Trio, and so I would encourage you to listen to some of the ""cuts"" here at Amazon.  Not only is Lynne an excellent composer, she and her trio interpret the music of other's like no one else.  Listen to their interpretation of Burt Bacharach's ""A House Is Not A Home"" and see if it doesn't rip your heart out.  I cannot recommend the music of the Lynne Arriale Trio enough.  Why not take a moment and enrich your life buy making a purchase of the Trio's latest release: Inspiration.  And, while you're at it, if you don't have their other recordings, may I suggest to add them to your music library as well.  You will NOT be disappointed.  I am happy to end this review in the way I most often like to:  DAYTON SAYS:  BUY THIS CD"
1,Were is my boy Prince man this really ticked me off he is only on one song first disc just another sucker then you dont hear him anymore maybe they were alking about us if your a prince fan dont buy this unless you collect his songs like i do cause just another sucker is all you get for a person that collects i dont have that one
5,This often overlooked CD is probably the very best all around recording of Kenny's.  It's got everything!  It's bluesy and beautiful and the material is very well rounded.  The tune &quot;Since I Fell For You&quot; sounds  like it could have been written for Kenny and &quot;'Round Midnight&quot;  maybe the definitive version of an often recorded masterpiece. Buy this  record.  You won't regret it
2,"I'm a metal head but I'm not a fan of this type of metal but the quality is good and these guys are somewhat from my area, but I'm just not a fan of the Rah, Rah, Rah, Blah, Blah screaming mess. I love the guitars and the band itself just NO vocals and melody. It's very one dimensional, but different strokes for different folks. If you like war hooting and demon squealing Death Metal then you'll love this. Sorry guys not a fan of it (just an opinion though, don't get bent over it)"
1,"The album is rushed, being produced just in 8 days.  It did not showcase Casey's talent and sales charts speak even louder. Poor Casey. She deserves a better album than this"
1,I was suckered into buying this years ago and the sound was so bad that I immediately sold it as used for pennies on the dollar.  I strongly suggest you buy another anthology of their music instead
1,"Damn Yankees was a supergroup containing Ted Nugent,Tommy Shaw(STYX),Jack Blades(Nightranger)and someother guy. All talented musicians, who are best heard in their prespective groups. Damn Yankees just doesn't rock,like it should. I've given it a chance and just can't get into it. A lot of talent involved, just doesn't do anything for me"
5,"Every track on this album is a standout.  An instant classic from a classic band.  The boys have never rocked harder, sang better, and grooved groovier.  I can't get this CD out of player.  I can't get the hooks out of my mind- I go to sleep at night humming one of the tunes, usually the Joseph Williams-sung chorus on ""Bottom of Your Soul.""  I absolutely loved the guest musicians on this record- James Pankow(Chicago)and Ian Anderson (Jethro Tull) especially.  I don't know if you can Call Steve Porcaro a ""guest-musician,"" especially with artistic work with the overall sonic ""canvas"" and cool timbres he is able to evoke.  He is a genius. Why these guys can't get any radio airplay in the States anymore is beyond me.  They are so much better than all of the crap that comes out on the radio nowadays. I hope they tour the US hard for the next couple of years and win over old-fans and new converts."
4,This Band is pretty good i think it had potenial to become better &quot;BoneThrower&quot; is prob the best song on here but i could be wrong all of the songs are worthy and could be hits its alot better than Limp Bizkit and Puddle Of Mudd which come from the same record company as these guys.....but i put this band in the standards of SoundGarden which is saying alot if you like SoundGarde
5,This cd rocks!  I bought it years ago and still listen to it all the time.  I love the indigo girls
5,"Owning most of their output, this is my favorite, followed by ""Mirror Conspiracy"" and then ""Cosmic Game"". Re-mixed tunes from obscure (to me) artists segue into one another for over an hour's musical world tour, Thievery-Style.  Their musical perspective explores the best elements of each choice, moving on at the perfect time to keep you interested and wanting more. Unlike a lot of CDs, this set stays strong towards the end!  Stand outs: 'International Flight' 'Sea Groove' 'Cramp your Style' 'Re-return of the Original Artform' 'Expo in Tokyo' 'My French Brother'  Super-nice artwork and cover treatments.  Take this to a party only if you never want to see it again"
5,"This album is a classic...every f-in track....it'll take you back....waaaay back....it'll make you bounce,it'll make you angry,it'll lift you up,and it'll make you cry...a C.D. you cannot quit playing and always nice soul food to go back to...you gotta get it and you gotta get it now "
5,"A recording that will stand the test of time and serve as a reminder of just what a genius Schenker is with a Gibson Flying V.  A lot of my friends listened to this CD for the first time and simply said; ""Holy smokes! Where did he come from?"" I then tell them he recorded this 25 years ago and was way younger than most of them.  They were all utterly speechless and now are fans.  What a great solo effort and Schenker came out of the gates with guns ablazing.  Incredible material, song writing, production and performance by all band members.  Simon Phillips is a very talented drummer and lays down some serious tracks.  Highlight of this CD is the solo at the end of ""Lost Horizons"", that is mind boggling guitar work that is beyond replication.  This is a staple for anyone who follows extreme guitar talent and has an appreciation for master guitar work that will live on as long as music is played.  Awesome!"
5,"Van Go Gan is excellent. I'd been waiting many months to recieve this cd and was thrilled and surprised once it arrived. Every song is strong in it's arrangements and vocals. In my estimation every track is interesting but with ""Kiss Life"", ""International"", ""Sunrise Sunset"" being standouts. This cd also contains a unique spin on ""Now Sue"" and never get tired of hearing ""I Need You"" which has interesting harmonies and background vocals. As one reviewer stated some songs are simple and uncluttered, it's just the vocals and a guitar done acoustically. This cd is always in rotation in my player and highly recommended"
5,"As a jazz guitar player, i personally love stan getz, and to hear him with ray brown, one of my favorite and greatest bass players ever. This was also the first i have listened to Herb Ellis play, his parts are a bit quiet but hey all guitarist were quiet until Charlie Christian. All in Four Really great musicians playing together, if you like this , check out russell malone, ray brown and monty alexander's Cd."
4,"In the 1990s, the Country Music began to go through some transitions. Country music which had for the most part stayed in a vacuum began to go mainstream and embrace other genres of music. As a result, the sound started to change. One artist that led this transition was Faith Hill.   Faith Hill had previously released two albums, but it was her 1998 breakthrough album ""Faith"" that helped her break into mainstream music.  Surprisingly, while ""Faith"" did cross-over into the mainstream, there still is a strong country element on this album.   By no means do I consider myself a Country Music expert.  The nice thing about ""Faith"" is that I believe it caters to a fan like myself that may not be deep into Country Music, but can appreciate many of the elements Country Music can bring to the table.   While ""Faith"" could be directed to a more casual fan like myself, I think the collection does an admirable job at addressing the fan who is deeper when it comes to the Country Music genre.   Faith Hill brings an interesting formula to this album.  Faith's role on the collection is primarily of vocalist.  Since she is focused on vocals, she is dependent on a solid cast of characters (musicians and songwriters) to support her effort.  On ""Faith"", this doesn't appear to be a problem.  She is surrounded by many top notch studio musicians and is given an oustanding slate of songs to work with.  Given this solid infrastructure, Faith is able to provide stellar vocals and produce a great product.   The interesting twist to this formula is that Faith Hill is a co-producer on all 12 songs.   Therefore she just isn't a ""vocalist for hire"".  She ultimately is deciding what the songs should be and how the final product should sound.  This is why ""Faith"" is a solid collection.  ""This Kiss"" was the song that made Faith Hill a household name on the mainstream music scene.   This was also the song that was my first introduction to Faith Hill.  In 1998, I first heard this song on the radio and it completely blew me away.   One reason why this song made it into the mainstream arena is that it does have qualities that make it sound like a ""pop"" song.  However, there is a true country element to this song - complete with Steel Guitar and Fiddle (played by Glen Duncan).    This instrumentation gives the song a most unique flavor.  The song features some very clever and catchy lyrics such as ""It's a centrifugal motion; It's perpetual bliss; It's that pivotal moment"".  The vocals are delivered with a very up-tempo pace (with little rests between the words) and that also contribute to the unique flavor.  This song features some great background vocals by Chris Rodriguez (who provides background vocals on several other songs on the album) and Beth Nielson Chapman (who is a co-writer for this song).  At first, upon purchasing ""Faith"", I expected it would basically be ""This Kiss"" and not much else.  However, after my first listen to this collection - I realized that this was not the case.   There were many other terrific songs that are included on this collection.   The second song ""You Give Me Love"" is also pretty catchy.  This has much more of a country element on this song.  This song is highlighted by some terrific drums and more Fiddle by Glen Duncan.   Although not as catchy a song, ""Let Me Let Go"" is worth mentioning.  The highlight of this particular song is background vocals by Vince Gill.  Gill is a master in the domain of steering Country Music toward the mainstream, but not abandoning the Country Music element.  This song clearly has a Country Element and it works.  This song also features a string section of viola players.  The Country Music element is alive and well in the song ""Better Days"".   This song was co-written by former Fleetwood Mac vocalist Billy Burnette.  This song also features Duncan's Fiddle.    The Country Music element is also present in the song ""My Wild Frontier"".   This is a powerful and sad song about a woman, who with her family moves into the Canadian Prairie.  Tragedy then strikes when the woman's baby son dies in his sleep.  This song is a great example of some of how a very well written song is made even better by some very emotional and powerful vocals by Faith.  The best song on the album is ""The Secret of Life"".   This song was co-written by Gretchen Peters, who is a songwriter that worked with Bryan Adams on ""On a Day Like Today"" and his ""Unplugged"" album.   The song is about exactly what the title says - telling little bits on what ""the secret of life is"".   No loss of a solid country feel in this song - including more great fiddle by Duncan.  Simple lyrics like ""The Secret of Life is in Sam's Martini"" (Sam is a character that is referred to in the song) or ""The Secret of Life is a Good Cup of Coffee"" give this song a very special quality.  Two other country element songs are that are solid are ""Just to Hear You Say That You Love Me"" and ""The Hard Way"".  In ""Just to Hear You Say You Love Me"", Faith does a terrific duet with her husband Tim McGraw.   As for ""The Hard Way"", this is very powerful song (more great Fiddle) and is best described by the lyrics ""I Keep Livin and Lovin and Learnin The Hard Way"".  Finally, ""Me"" is another good song - this song has more of a pop element and deals with a woman changing who she is.  On a side note, Sheryl Crow is a co-writer of ""Somebody Stand By Me"".  Not a great song, but worth mentioning.  All of the lyrics, studio musicians, songwriting and production credits are listed in the liner notes.  This album should appeal to Country Music and Mainstream fans.  Highly Recommended"
1,"Lie to me and Wander this world are so much different and much much better, if you are a blues fan. I bought it for ""Give me up again"", which is in a very good version on the Clapton DVD ""Crossroads Festival"". The rest is more like a Prince style, Pitty, hardly any guitar, Jonny is slipping away from the blues"
4,"Just saw the ""kid"" the other night and the tracks he played from Long Time Coming blew the house away. What is missing on the studio versions are the blistering (understatement) leads he incorporated. The title track and Give Me Up Again both earned well deserved standing ovations. I can't wait for a live album. Myself, I just mixed a CD incorporating the best of all three albums and Long Time Coming makes it an all around great listen."
5,"As for these songs great!!! The cd in general cover and all super great!!! 5 stars on Westside Connection. This is probably my second favorite cd 1 after (2 Pac) these guys (Mac 10 WC and Ice Cube) they can rap and there beats these are the kinda songs I have bumpin in my ride all the time, this is what I call hard core oldschool rap. This is the kinda rap thats true not this rap crap!!! of today. I cant explain to you it's just the lyrics and the way they rap to them. You just put it all together and you get a really sick cd like this one (bow down). Now I have to say this is to another cd that I like every song on it it's just like the knew akwid, I love every song on that cd but on this 1 I do have favorites like of course (Bow Down, Gangsta's Make The World Go Round, Do You Like Crimainals, The Gangsta The Killer And The Dope Dealer, Westside Ho, Hoo Banin) damm!!! thats like most of the cd but I got to tell you all the songs are great this is definitly a must bump in your ride cd believe me  this cd will have you bumpin. westside connection you doin fine!!!"
1,"I don't need ""MISFITS"" wannabe's in the good ol' united states so I definetely dont need some woah woah ooh crap sung in japanese! Buy Earth a.d., Static Age,Walk Among Us,Legacy of Brutality or hell even Evilive to see what these losers wish they were. Just cause your songs are like fater than hell doesn't mean their good"
5,"This is undeniably a tragic yet great album.  A friend of mine can't play it anymore, because he can't stand hearing a soul in torment, which is what the album is.  It's so naked emotionally.  Spence just bears everything, his very being, his very soul.  The only other albums that come close to this is Nick Drake's final studio album, Pink Moon, and Lee Hazlewood's emotionally wretching Requiem for an Almost Lady.  I won't recount Spence's back story, for other reviewers have done it very well.  The songs go right to your very being.  There is no BS here.  This was who Spence was at the time, warts and all.  It is a testament to another sensitive, young soul destroyed by celebrity, the ""business"", drugs, etc., etc..  This was Spence's only real solo album, and it's a true masterpiece, mysterious, moving, and beautiful. "
2,"This work was recorded at Eastern Sound in Toronto under the worst of creative conditions,produced by Vinnie Testa who's only claim to fame was supposedly being aquainted with Shadow Morton who produced the Fudge.The album was released on MGM Lion and followed the release of the single Lost Son which was a London Parrot single. Now the facts:Earth Omen,New Horizon and Lost Son were in truth composed as a trilogy by Jon Wearing who had been working with another Michigan artist and associate Dick Wagner after the demise of the Frost.Wagner went on to form Ursa Major and Wearing who had been working in the Detroit music scene since 1966 with the Tidalwaves and had a hit Farmer John signed with Pink with the agreement for the first work 20% of his writing would be distributed equally among the other members of the band who were totally lost and down and out. Testa and Wearing could never see eye to eye, the management had no idea what they were doing, IRS and legal issues and the entire project was a wash and Wearing left to form a very good R&B influenced rock band called Deluxe. Deluxe toured with Joe Walsh, James Cotton, Atlanta Rhythm Section,opened for Seger and many others.Dallas Hodge,Ray Craig,KimballLee,Greg Caulder and Wearing comprised the band that had been targeted by Epic to sign. Leo Fenn part of the Alice Cooper business organization and Wearing pal was the manager until heads got out of control in part do to Johnny Winter's medling and then John Sinclair became the manager and demise of this fine act. Hodge continues to work with Canned Heat overseas and Wearing still provides moments with the Detroit based Ghostband.Wearing attempted to provide some quality to Pink however was stiffled by the mis-management of Clyde Stevers and Marv Wilson. Enough for now, The Truth"
5,"This greatest hits collection is a nice overview of Jermaine's work from the late '70s, through to the early '90s.  There are some great upbeat dance tracks along with some slow jams.  The only downside to this collection is that it doesn't include &quot;When the rain begins to fall&quot;, a duet that he did with Pia Zadora back in 1983/84.  This doesn't take away from the other classics like &quot;Do what you do&quot;, and &quot;Dynamite&quot;.  I seemed to have a few singles of Jermaine's from back in the day, so it's nice to have his songs on CD to enjoy for a long time.  There are other greatest hit collections out there, but I opted for this one because it was released by Arista, which was one of 3 labels that Jermaine was signed with.  It sounds clear &amp; clean, not screechy like some other older recordings converted to CD do.  If you like some great r&amp;b, then Jermaine Jackson's &quot;Heritage Collection&quot; will hit the spot"
1,"I bought this never having problems from Amazon.com before.  They did not state that this was a Sony product and when I received it, all the CD had on it was a root kit virus.  It would not even play in my CD player.  When I tried to read the CD to copy and burn the ""WAV"" files to a new CD so I could just listen to the music, all there were on the CD was executables and no sound files.  Sony is very poor quality now and I do not want to buy it again"
5,it's hard to imagine getting all these artists to perform on one single recording of this magnitude. my hat goes off to mark for this extremly important work of ar
4,"I was downloading some shows when I came across a show by some band called  Galactic. I liked it but didn't think much about it. Then last week I saw  Counting Crows and LIVE in concert. When I got there, there was this band  jamming out. I saw the second half of their set, all the time wondering  &quot;who are these guys?&quot; Then they announced that they were  Galactic. The next day I went and bought this CD and I could not be  happier. The blend of funky blues-like singing, jazzy horn play, and the  rock guitar riffs is awesome. This band reminds me very much of a jazz trio  called Medeski, Martin, and Wood. However, Galactic offers great singing  and horns giving them a much more diverse sound. For me, this is one of  those CD's that I don't know any of the song titles because whenever I  listen to it, I listen to the whole thing straight. If you like jazz and  you like jam bands, get this album"
1,ITEM NEVER RECEIVED. IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTACT BY EMAIL THE CUSTOMER SERVICE. MY LAST PURCHASE ON AMAZON 
5,"Great song. I love Patti Smith's version but this one's even better. That song alone is worth however much you pay for this album. Plus you get other rare gems (and great Bruce songs) such as Fire, Seeds and Paradise by the ""C"" (great title!), not to mention killer versions of Bruce classics such as Rosalita, Born to Run, Thunder Road, Badlands, Darkness on the Edge of Town, The River, Independence Day, etc. Whether you're a completist or a huge fan of The Boss (I fall in the latter camp), you really should pick this up."
4,"this  makes awesome workout (elliptical, running, treadmill) music for interval training; wonderfully paced..... can just SEE a Martha Graham choreo. to it while you work out"
5,"I got this album because it was recommended to me by Amazon.com's computerized recommendations system. Being adventurous, I bought it on a whim. I was very pleasantly surprised! Unlike many other popular trance anthems with female vocals, this one is not at all cheesy or monotonous. All of the tracks feature high-quality production and skillful mixing: no amateurish boom-tss filler anywhere on this single. Mavie Marcos has a gorgeously supple voice (reminds me of Kirsty Hawkshaw) and nice pronunciation (I know that it's not politically correct to say this, but it bugs me when the vocalist sounds like a chavette who has gone through accent-reduction training). I highly recommend this CD to anyone who has good taste! Even IDM snobs will appreciate the intricate layering of sound in these tracks"
5,"Yes, I was once like you.  Enraptured by XTC's more lush productions like Skylarking.  But maturity encouraged me to pay closer attention to GO 2 and it has proven to be their finest hour.  Pure, raw, creative energy captured on tape.  This is what Andy and Colin are capable of when not distracted by their more Beatlesque leanings.  There are lots of good tunes on the later albums, of course.  Drums and Wires and English Settlement are personal favorites.  But XTC never exploded with this level of combustion again"
5,"Does &quot;XTC&quot; mean &quot;mannered, pretentious, overworked drivel&quot; to you? Well, then. Twenty years and more since I first heard them, I think that this is their best album, with Drums and Wires a close second. By Black Sea they were sinking into the Sergeant Pepperization process that would reduce those countless later albums to meaninglessness. This is raw, vital rock music, wonderfully edgy and surprising, from a time in the band's history when they were effortlessly creative, instead of belaboring us, as the Rev. Partridge eventually ended up doing, with their attempts to Have Something To Say"
1,"This is one of the worst, not to mention most downright annoying albums to come out in recent memory.  Anyone who claims to like this overrated insult to underground music is just trying to sound cool, and failing miserably.  In fact, I'll go out on a limb here and say that anyone who says they like this album hasn't even heard the damn thing, and probably just saw it on a pitchfork list somewhere - and if pitchfork says it's good, it must be good, right?  Wrong.  This album sucks.  It's sad to see people so desperate for indie cred (which, I hate to break it to you, isn't that cool either) that they degrade themselves by publicly admitting they enjoy this album.  However, I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys hearing Steve Albini ramble on like a douche, with mediocore music being played in the background.  Everyone else, save yourself the trouble and the $10"
4,"When Harry Reser wasn't leading the two best hot white jazz bands of the 1920's, the Six Jumping Jacks and the Clicquot Club eskimos, he was making these incredible banjo recordings. Think of Harry Reser as the Les Paul of the 1920's. His fingers were the fastest in the world and his technique was jaw dropping. He seems to playing chords and picking at the same time or is he playing two banjos at once? This particular album will appeal more to guitarists and musicians than to those seeking twenties pop music. For those, grab the other Harry Reser albums on Amazon"
4,"This recording of Messiah is an attempt at using period instruments (either authentic or replicas from the Baroque period) and performing it in the correct manner of ""Baroque performance"" (at least as best as we can know).  Clearly there are many difficulties in trying to accurately pull this off, but the result does seem to be very Baroque.    Reviewers have two main objections, which the prospective listener should keep in mind.  Many Messiah fans are used to ""un-Baroque"" performances of Messiah--a 100+ member chorus singing with a full tone, a large orchestra, large dynamic contrasts, and slower tempos.  When people accustomed to such performances hear Hogwood's recording, it is often labeled as ""dry,"" ""unemotional,"" or ""light.""    Other reviewers object to the quality of the performance itself.  I think that the soloists could do a better job.  The bass is strong, but he could be better, and I think there should be more ornamentation overall.  I personally like the sound of boys singing instead of adult women in the choir, but others may differ.  Other Baroque recordings such as Gardiner, McGegan, or Harnoncourt are also good period recordings.  If you want more traditional interpretations, take a look at Thomas Beecham's or Robert Shaw's recordings.  If you're looking for a complete, scholarly interpretation, however, I think this is a great recording.  Oh, and the accompanying booklet is great, too--very thorough."
5,"Beautiful music and a nice variety, what you would expect from Windhill.  The only flaw, tracks five and six are switched from the list on the album cover; #5 is &quot;First Noel&quot; and #6 is &quot;Christmas Is Coming&quot;.  Highly recommended"
1,Pure pretention.  Anyone really interested in true post-modern art can find more compelling works elsewhere.  Minus 5 stars. 
5,"this is one of those bluegrass albums. you cant be without, i love everysong from this album not a bad one at all. bluegrass albums are my favorites by him i was raised on bluegrass music. and i know alot about ricky skaggs, from my dad who is also a mandolin picker and singer and he had the great joy of meeting ricky's sister at a studio once... would love to meet the man himself someday if your a bluesgrass or a rickyskaggs fan then get the album you'll be glad you did"
5,"I love this album!  It takes me back to the islands, basking in the sun, sipping a mai tai, w/ some local cats playing under the palapa.  I'm a big fan of the Aqua Velvets, and Miles playing is stunninly gorgeous on this cd  as well"
5,"I saw a great show at Fishlips in Bakersfield last Wednesday: Wayne ""The Train"" Hancock. He sang like a modern-day Hank Williams, and had a great band, just Jake on stand up bass, and Johnny on the Telecaster. Wayne just strummed an acoustic guitar, one stroke per beat, but was always right in the pocket, his guitar was holding down the tempo while the electric guitar filled in when he wasn't singing, and the bass just kept the beat going like crazy. It is a testament to the trio's chops that they could inspire someone to dance right from the first song. They had a really crazy rhythm going and it never let up. And there was not even a drummer in the band. The bass player was always pushing the beat, but with perfect placement, and intonation, which ain't that easy on a fretless stand up bass.  Wayne played for about 2 hours, and he let his girlfriend Gina play a few songs while he took a break. I took that opportunity to get Wayne's autograph. When he got back on stage he sang and talked about all the counties where he was incarcerated. Quite a few.  I loved the show, it was a prodigious display of musical virtuosity. If you closed your eyes you could have sworn it was Hank Williams, yet he had his own style, and wasn't just a clone of Hank. He was what Hank would sound like if he were alive and just a little bit older than Hank Williams III, his grandson is right now.   The songs on Tulsa are great, and whether he is live or in the studio, he sounds fantastic. Wayne Hancock refuses to compromise his music, to sweeten it, to make it more commercial, to do anything other than play music he really feels deep down inside, and to make you feel it deep down inside, too. "
5,"Along with the one song I've been looking for, this has a lot of great songs"
5,"Clocking in at a little less than 60 Minutes, 'Scratchology' will definately take you through the study of Scratching importance in Hip Hop history. The next time you're thinking of taking a drive or a walk, pop this CD in your player and let it ride, because it will definately take you down memory lane with flavor added by The X-Ecutioners"
2,"Censored &quot;bits&quot; of Lenny Bruce.  His earliest work, but not nearly as great as he was to become.  Has some great stuff but not really his best work. Get a live performance for the real reason people love  Lenny"
2,"I bought this CD based on the fact that I liked Ultra Dance 2.  I thought the third one would be another good CD to listen to for the summer.  I was disappointed when I got my CDs and listened to them.  The mixes on these songs are terrible, with the exception of two tracks.  On the other hand, Ultra Dance 2, which is mixed by DJ Encore, is much better in comparison.  Although the songs on Ultra Dance 2 are last year songs, it is worth more than this one.  Trust me, you are not missing anything"
1,"OK. I just got this CD today, and now i'm happy. Was late, but only got this album for ""good morning beautiful"""
5,As another reviewer said. This may be the easiest CD to wear out in 10 days
4,"At a rather hip friend's insistence, I first heard this album in mid to late high school (circa 1995).  Seeing as that those years were ground zero for teenage angst and all that comes with being hormonal, confused, and lovelorn, I seized onto this band with a fervor (right along with Mineral, Seam, and a few others).  To this day, when I hear the opening bass chords and the swelling drums of the first song, I instinctively grit my teeth, get my rock face on, and prepare to air drum on my steering wheel.  This is a powerful record, one that bends and weaves with a beautiful intensity throughout.  The desperation of hardcore is still very much a presence in TITR's music, but it's bound tight with melody, memorable time signatures, and pop-savvy structures.  Granted, Garrett's voice can drive people away from the band if they aren't willing to give it time (he's more than a tad nasal), but the songs stick with you. Definitely an album to purchase if you're even momentarily interested in the mid-'90's tail end of the ""emo/post hardcore"" movement. As for the guy who suggested that the EP was better than this full-length, don't believe it.  Get this, and dig in"
1,"In the 70's there was American  British and Canadian rock. Its a shame that most living outside of Canada didn't get an opportunity to hear a lot more of the Canadian product. My biggest beef with all of the April Wine ""greatest hits"" compilations was the fact that most of the rocking early years has been largely ignored. Who put these compilations together? Where was lead singer/songwriter/guitarist Myles Goodwyn during all of this? Where is ""Fast Train, Bad Side of the Moon, Drop Your Guns, Electric Jewels, Weeping Widow, Just Like That, You Could Have Been a Lady, Anything You Want, Victim for Your Love, Forever for Now, Cat's Claw, Come on Along, The Band Has Just Begun"" etc etc etc? The albums ""Electric Jewels, On Record and Stand Back"" as well as ""Live at the El Mocambo"" are much more representative of April Wine. Canada rocked, we really did. You just wouldn't know it from this pap."
2,"I have to admit that I had not really listened to Mika before I saw him in concert in Stockholm. He does what he does reasonably well for this genre. Good falsetto voice although it gets a bit loud and annoying during the show. Here is what made me lose all respect for this artist. During his show in Stockholm he only played for 60 minutes, including an encore. I am sorry, but no artist worth anything would walk away only playing 60 minutes. Overall I would say ok voice, pretty weak songwriting, and pathetic live show. I lost what little respect I gained for Mika during the first few songs. Weak, weak, weak."
1,"This CD is just plain horrible.  It lacks in real talent and it is as cliche as you can get.  Hey, The Grateful Dead was a good band, but new hippie-wanna-be bands just don't have the talent.  The only people who buy  these albums are just 14 year old freshmen in High School looking for an  excuse to be &quot;popular.&quot;  Well, my bashing has been done, so I  will leave you on this note;  If you hear twinkle-twinkle-little-star music  once, doesn't it just get plain boring"
1,"I Purchased the Winter Solstice Vol #3 thinking that it would be as good as the rest,was I disappointed. Tracks 5,6,7,10,11.13 are atrocious,the rest of the tracks are good.I cant get to my CD player fast enough to skip over them when they start playing.I now sample every song on the CDs and dont take for granted that all Winter Solstices are created equal.People,please start giving honest reviews and stop the false advertisement"
5,"I noticed this CD because of the name of the band and the suggestions from other Amazon customers. I must say it is one of my favorite CD's! The songs have great rythmn and the energy of the artists translate beautifully even though I don't speak Spanish or Japanese(one of my favorite songs!)Everyone-aged from 17 to 83 that has heard this CD, will request me to play it when they visit. Pepe's voice reminds me so much of Ricky Ricardo, that I'm surprised the album isn't called ""Latenight Lucy""!! Can't wait for the release of their next CD.  "
2,"I heard ""Heart of Mine"" in the closing credits for the movie Runaway Jury.  After listening to the album, I found that was really the only tune I liked.  Peter Malick is a veteran of the hard-charging James Montomery Band (who I have seen tear up stages of Northeast blues clubs), which is why the sleepiness of most of these pieces mystifies me.  You could argue that he is going for a ""relaxed"" feel, to which I would repsond he succeeds all too well.  Norah Jones can sing, and sing well- no argument there, but these songs are not great.  The lyrics I found to be a little too clever, like some music student's term paper.  For most of the album I felt like everyone was trying way too hard to do something deep and meaningful.  Having said all this, ""Heart of Mine"" is an excellent record, and might even be worth the price of the CD.  Of course, to get the one good track, you could try downloading it for a dollar from itunes or your favorite MP3 site."
2,"Jill Sobule really hit it big with her first hit &quot;I Kissed a Girl&quot;, which is on her second self-titled album &quot;Jill Sobule&quot;.  This first album  isn't really all that good; like she was  still finding herself.  For a better album, check out her &quot;Jill  Sobule&quot; album or even better &quot;Happy Town&quot;"
5,"This album deserves to be (at least) as popular as Led Zeppelin's first two albums or Deep Purple's ""In Rock"" and ""Machinehead"" albums. Simply great. And by the way, you should check out Ten Years After's ""A Space in Time"" too. The high point of the album, which includes many fine tracks, is ""Come Together in the Morning"". And the original version of ""Wishing Well"" is so much more powerful than the better-known version by Gary Moore, which just doesn't do the song justice. While many reviewers rave about Paul Kossoff's guitar work, I think this album is a real showcase for Paul Rodgers, one of rock music's greatest singers"
2,"I know that this review will be followed by several saying that I am stupid and am not aware of how awesome Shadows Fall is, but I still think it is worthwhile to let other people know my opinion. I was excited for this album, Shadows Fall shows so much potential at times but this release is such a disappointment. While it isn't terrible, it just is not good. It suffers the pitfall of many metal releases, all the songs follow identical formats and never keep your interest. If you don't believe me, scan through this CD and let me know if almost all (with the exception of one or two) aren't : a kind of cool guitar intro that might lead to something cool, then drums come in with the same predictable snare on every beat,and then mediocre vocals singing some of the most lackluster vocal in recent memory.  Don't buy this album looking for some sort of blistering heavy metal experience. Don't buy this album if you want something you may replay again. If you want to buy a mediocre heavy metal album then I guess you should buy this album, but I say take a stand. Don't just buy whatever Shadows Fall puts out in front of you. The War Within was a good CD. The follow up bonus track CD was just a desperate attempt to make more money with nothing new and this CD is just a group that didn't really try and put out some music.  I'm sorry to all the die hard Shadows Fall fans, and you may enjoy this album which is great for you, but I really felt like Shadows Fall underachieved and didn't really put enough into this release. I know they could have done better"
2,"I bought this to assist my recovery from a long bout with Lyme disease.  I found it minimally useful.  It is relaxing, but I was hoping some more creative visualizations directed toward healing one's body.  Perhaps it is intended to heal the soul, which may ultimately heal the body, but I was disappointed"
4,I was hapy to receive this cd and almost all of the songs play correctly but the last two songs will not play unless you do it manually. I Have a High end Harmon Kardon System so that is not why. I cleaned the disc but still no straight playthrough.   My wife is p'od since she doesn't know how to manually start these two songs. 
1,"If you wish to learn something interesting re the fact that the keys of b minor and Bb major share the note D as their third, you would do far better to consult a decent recording of Beethoven's Hammerklavier Sonata than this navel-gazing narcissistic atrocity"
1,"THIS SHOULD PROBABLY GO TO CUSTOMER SERVICE, BUT YOUR RETURN POLICY SAYS YOU CAN'T RETURN OPENED CDs so if I can't return it, perhaps others can learn from this what can happen when you order online. I thought I was getting the whole CD and when I opened it and put it on, it turned out to have the song Not Ready to Make Nice, one other song and then some video of Not Ready to Make Nice. I checked with a friend who has the album and she said there should be lots of other songs on it. Can you send me the album I thought I was buying"
5,Get this cd! The entire cd is a joyous experience. This is R&B Soul at it's best......
2,I was hyped about them coming back after they rocked on DJ Quik's Rhythmalism.that album was slammin'but this disc is about 5 years past the pull date on style.Up 'N Da CLub is tight.straight up DJ Quik is a Musical  Genius.but he can't pull this disc off Properly.AMG is banging on the track  but overall it's missing something
1,"Unfortunately, perhaps, I am a performing musician (voice, keyboards, flute, guitar, and a smathering of other instruments)as well as a composer, and also a fan of fresh, innovative treatments of familiar tunes. I search out and buy two or three new Christmas CD's each year and listen to them non-stop for the month of December. I had great hopes that this Liebert CD would be inspiring and was disappointed that it was the opposite. Each tune follows the formula of the rhythm section playing a straight-ahead version of whatever song with Liebert playing a totally traditional, single-note melody on top, often co-mingled with a couple of motifs from another Christmas song. The rhythm section plays the same traditional chord progressions again while Liebert &quot;jams,&quot; using the same trite, tired riffs. BORING"
1,"Admittedly, I don't scour the surface of the Earth for hard to find B, C, and D-class tracks to add to my metal collection. If you do, you may agree with the novelist who wrote the first review on this set. As for me, this is one of those items that you just have to admit to yourself was a mistake and file it with sanitation engineering. Luckily, I got mine on clearance"
1,"One of the best pieces of rock ever recorded, one of the worst reissue I ever heard. Do not buy this Japanese import! If you know what this album is suppose to sound like then you will want to cry when you hear Sony's butchering of this reissue. I am not being over critical here, this mix will make you cringe, or maybe we are just getting spoiled by Rhino's superb job? It's a cryin sham"
5,"The music set to Midsummer Night's Dream arranged here by Boswell yields good things but is not entirely great. For instance, since the movie had the story set in Tuscany, Italy, there are a lot of  songs of the opera, since opera was founded in Italy and it makes one feel more at home with the movie location. Also, Intermezzo from Cavalleria Rusticana, an opera intermission music by Mascagni, is heard here. I think these things are all out of place. There should be more emphasis on the music of Shakespeare's time- oboe, flute and Renaissance instruments. The soundtrack to &quot;Much Ado About Nothing &quot; is even better since it does manage to remain Shakespearian. But otherwise this music is beautiful, especially the Midsummer Night's Dream Music by Mendelsshon -the Overture is a delightful, sunny piece to hear and then there is the famous signature Wedding March. I recommend anyone to get the entire classical work- the Scherzo is just as good and other selections. This cd is good but not great. In opera, it has featured its brightest stars- Fleming, Domingo and Bartoli. But a great cd nonetheless"
5,Byrd&amp;Burrell really stand out here.The Music here is very essential to the ear.Donald Byrd has Been Bad for SO Long that it's Amazing at his Depth&amp;Talent.The Music Here is in a Class all onto it's own.A Must have  from Two Legends.The Arrangements&amp;Productions are tight
5,"If you're looking for a collection of just the hits, stick with 2003's SOUNDS OF SUMMER. If you need a nostalgia fix for the Beach Boys' best albums of the Sixties through the mid-Seventies, pick up the two-fers of their classic albums from SURFIN' SAFARI through SURF'S UP. However, if you want a solid overview of America's most influential band and why Brian Wilson is regarded as a genius, wrap your ears around this 5-disc GOOD VIBRATIONS box set. Brian Wilson and company take you on a  magical history tour from their debut single ""Surfin'"" to their final No. 1, ""Kokomo."" ESSENTIA"
1,"Save your money and buy something else. The Dylan performances are few and uninspired. The rest -- peformances of Dylan -- are sometimes good, sometimes amusing, sometimes odd, but don't amount to much as a collection. I wanted to see the movie until I heard the soundtrack"
5,This album blew me away from the moment I heard it. The only downside is there are not many songs with vocals on the album. If you like old funk or soul then this album is for you. These guys will leave footprints in the history books of this genre
5,"This new album by former Mr.Big guitar player Paul  Gilbert is a nice surprise! Beatle-esque melodies coupled with good leading and backing vocals, not forgetting the intrincate, fast melodic guitar riffs and chops  make this a delicious CD. Highlights include the first track &quot;Get  It&quot; with its infectious theme and the ballad &quot;Kate is a  Star&quot;. Listen to flying dog and have a good time"
1,"I have purchased (and returned) four, count 'em, four Green Mile soundtrack CD's because of numerous skips. I keep going back, hoping the problem has been fixed, but no luck. I wrote Warner Brothers about this and I have not received a response to date. Has anyone else run into this frustrating problem"
5,"Satch is full of surprises. Thats the very reason he still has such a strong fan following and keeps getting more popular. In this album he made the right decision by brining in Nathan East, Manu Katche and Andy Fairweather Low as his studio musicians. The virtuosity of every musician on this album is astronomical. Songs like If, Cool no9, down down down, etc are the Satriani you never have heard of before."
5,"Throughout his musical career, Chris De Burgh has offered albums filled with beautiful, creative and imaginative songs.  The Storyman carries this idea to its zenith with a collection of incredible tracks.  ""One World"" is the perfect expression of spiritual and secular equality.  Performed and sung beautifully, it is one of De Burgh's finest moments.  The heart wrenching ""The Shadow Of The Mountain"" and uplifting ""Raging Storm"" are both utterly beautiful.  ""The Sweetest Kiss Of All"" is a touching love song with a fantastic melody.  ""The Mirror Of The Soul"" is classic storytelling in musical form while ""The Storyman"" is a synopsis of all that is De Burgh and his career in one song.  The album, as a collection, is complete, cohesive and well recorded.  Each track stands as an example of the best in songwriting from practically any artist in popular music.    I am personally devastated by the power and beauty of this album.  Chris De Burgh has impressed me once again.  It's an incredible musical accomplishment"
5,"After listening to &quot;Into the Light&quot; and &quot;flying Colours&quot;, I began a search for more music by Chris De Burgh. Although the music differs somewhat in sound from his newer albums, from the moment  I heard Hold On I knew I would enjoy this album. My favorite is probably  Windy Night. But all of them are good respectively. I must say I found it  interesting how he was able to blend alittle of each song on the album onto  the lyrics of the end song, Goodnight. I also can't help but wonder if a  lyric from Satin Green Shutters didn't inspire a later song of his,  Forevermore. Whatever the case this is a wonderful piece for any true CDB  fa"
5,This item was delivered quickly (in time for Christmas) and cost me a lot less than buying it at any music store
2,"Classical music is beautiful and rewarding.  Can't it be rewarding on its own terms, rather than as a &quot;fast track&quot; to the Ivy League and financial success?  When I was a child, my parents played classical music  for us because they loved it, and they hoped we would, too.  I do the same  for my own kids.  But my siblings didn't much like classical music, and  despite the insulting and ludicrous claims made on this CD, their SAT  scores were in line with my own. I think that if Beethoven or Mozart knew  that their beautiful, timeless music was being cheapened into just another  &quot;get ahead quick&quot; scam, they'd roll over in their graves"
5,Harry was one of the great trumpters.  It was a pleasure to listen to his best works again
5,"The Stills are a Montreal indie rock band who write expertly woven melodies crafted in the familiar niche of swirly-80s-post-punksters like Echo & The Bunnymen or The Church, but add a unique neo-vibe which finds them comfortable next to say, Interpol or Bloc Party.  This is their best release by far, every song heart-wrenchingly wrought forward with layered guitars and superb lyrics.  If you like a comfortable mix of brit pop influence, a dash of romanticism and depression, finely crafted into guitar heavy pulsating riffs, then this is for you!  Fans of The Walkmen rejoice--this is the better purchase of the two~this LP is packed full of college radio singles, including ""Gender Bombs"" and ""Changes Are No Good."
1,Sorry but this didn't cut it for me.  It sounded more like a amateur rehersal tape than what i expect from the Beach Boys
5,"Every tune is fab! Thankfully, the remastering has not diminished the old scratchy sound typically found in recordings from this era.  This is why I hate most modern jazz. This has genuine feeling, a raw sound, natural flow, and catchy licks--things lacking these days, IMO.   Pick this up if you are not a huge jazz collector, but just wish to add something worthwile to your otherwise ecclectic collection of music"
2,"Although this album is a bit more insightful and less materialistic than his previous work, with the exception of BluePrint which is a classic and in a class of its own, I wasn't so anxious about him coming back or this album in general. He should've retired after Blueprint if he wanted to do it while he was ontop. The Black Album was alot better than the BluePrint2 which was one disc so-so to good and second disc made of 90% filler.  While this album shows a more storytelling, poet side of Jay-Z, it ain't exactly his best work. Actually this falls down at the bottom, right beneath his 1997 Vol 1 album. While his maturity as an artist has improved, his lyrical content has suffered. The first 5 songs are classic Jay-Z and the last two songs are classic hip-hop but the rest of the album in between sound more like demos of MC such&such. In my opinion, he has faltered quite a bit on this album, this is right under BluePrint2; BluePrint2 should've never been two discs let alone be a sequel to a hip-hop classic. Kingdom Come has a few good moments starting with the intro and leaving at Lost One, then coming back with Minority Report and ending altogether with Beach Chair, which could've had a better song title given the point of the song. Beyonce, Usher & Ne-Yo, John Legend and Chrisete could've been more utilized than singing hooks, let alone singing hooks on so-so songs. More thought could've been put into the album to make it a 3, and more could've been covered to make it a 4. But Jay is starting to let his Def Jam position affect him."
2,"There are two stellar tracks on this: &quot;McCarran Airport,"" sounding like a lost Jimmy Webb classic, and the wistfully gorgeous &quot;Spring Time.&quot; A quick look at the credits show they're the only two from the pen of brother Bruce. As for the rest -- think Kenny G meets H/D/H. Sadly, that stands for Hallmark/Doggerel/Hallmark. And that's too bad, as the vocals and sparse arrangements are right on the money. If there's to be a follow-up, give Bruce free reign"
2,"This album features 70s re-recordings of ET's hits. His Texas Troubodors at the time were a good band, but Ernest's voice had coarsened quite a bit by then. You can now get the original 40s and 50s recordings of Ernest's  hits on the Hall of Fame series. Even the 1958 remakes originally on the  Decca/MCA &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; and &quot;Ernest Tubb Story&quot; were  pretty good...but this album is for completists only"
5,"This album's music is well arranged, with a seductive blend of Spanish guitar and violin.  I've enjoyed every track, and have recommended his music to my music loving friends!!"
1,"What's wrong with BHG? Besides everything? Is it possible for them to write more than one good song in their pathetic lives? My sister burned this CD from a friend, most likely because she likes the Bad Touch song, and I'VE been the one having to hear it in the morning when she's getting ready for school. It's pathetic. I don't know how much I can stress the word ""pathetic"", but it's the only way to fully describe it. Out of 18 tracks, there's one, count it, ONE good song, ""The Inevitable Return of The Great White Dope"", because it's nothing like their other songs. Everything else on this album is just like ""Fire Water Burn"", ""The Bad Touch"", ""Hell Yeah"", you get the picture. Palm-muted, droning, songs with extremely explicit lyrics, which is the only reason people will remember them. Isn't it about time to come out of the 13-16 year old stage? Having lyrics about sex won't get you any. Bands like Blink-182, Sum 41, and System of a Down have funny songs, but they have their limits. About the ""music"": 1)Palm-muting doesn't make a song good. I get it. You can palm-mute. So can most people who play guitar or bass. 2)Make your music more diverse and varied, or at least change your patterns. Elastica's self-titled album has 4-chord patterns, except they play faster, and the songs aren't much longer than two and a half minutes long (not that I'm comparing BHG to Elastica). 3)Do what you do ""best"", and don't try metal. ""Magna Cum Nada"" is BHG's horrible attempt to make something metal-ish. Stop. The problem with Bloodhound Gang is that they just won't die. People like them somehow, and so they feel compelled to squeeze out more and more crap that gets worse and worse as it progresses, not saying that they were ever good.  Why don't we go through the songs and rate them, shall we?  1. I Hope You Die: See track 15 2. The Inevitable Return of The Great White Dope: Best song by BHG, but still not great. 3. Mama's Boy: See track 15 4. Three Point One Four: See track 15 5. Mope: See track 15 6. Yummy Down On This: See track 15  Catch my drift yet? I don't think I can fully show my displeasure with words. ""1 star , because 0 is not an option"" is exactly correct.  People, if you actually want Bloodhound Gang, copy it from someone. Maybe if they see their record sales go down, they'll actually think about quitting.  p.s. Track 15 is called ""This is Stupid."
5,"Winterheart's Guild(2003). Sonata Arctica's third studio album.  Unlike most people on this site apparently, I DON'T hate power metal. I'm not one who slags the whole genre off upon the discovery of other music like progressive rock and other styles like a lot of people do. When I first came across the genre years ago, I was in heaven. There were a lot of really cool albums by bands like Stratovarius, Labyrinth, Dream Evil, Blind Guardian, Primal Fear, Hammerfall, and others that brought forth the nostalgic sounds of some of my favorite 80s metal bands, though with the benefit of modern production technology. Sure, the subject matter among many of these bands can come across as goofy (almost bearing a Manowar quality at times), but most people seem to miss the point that none of it is meant to be taken seriously.  Of course, my interest in Power Metal has waned since then, but only because after a while, most of the bands I came across started to sound a lot alike with very little to separate them apart from others and make me want to come back for more. It seemed like all the bands had the same machine-gun double bass drumming, Malmsteen-inspired guitar solos, harpsichord keyboard soloing, and Geoff Tate-inspired singing. In short, I needed more _variety_.  Thankfully, bands like Sonata Arctica, Kamelot, and Nightwish are around to show the rest how to make a good, memorable band.  To me, Sonata Arctica sounds like a bigger, better, more realized Stratovarius. I'd known about the band for a while, and I've always loved the song 'Power Of One' off of Silence(2001) which was my first introduction to them. I finally saw one of their albums in the store the other day, and since I'm always looking for good music, I figured ""why not?"". After listening to this album several times now, I can honestly say that this was one of the best purchases I've made all year. While I do like Stratovarius, the problem I had with them is that their albums would have a couple of really outstanding songs on them, followed by several by-the-numbers tracks which they've formulated to death over and over again. Sonata Arctica has no problems like this. This band takes Stratovarius's sound as a main template, and infuses their own creative songwriting melodies and lyrical topics into it, creating a very memorable and varitable collection of songs. Their singer has that familiar Finnish accent, though it's combined with a real passionate performance. The guitarist always seems to play the right riff at the right time, varying it up from soulfull crunchy riffs to great solos that bring Glen Tipton of Judas Priest to mind. Keyboards go from solo-esque battles to goosebump-inducing atmospheric passages that compliment the melodies.  Picking out favorite tracks on this album is a very difficult thing to do, but the ones that seem to stand out the most are 'APBE', 'Gravenimage', 'The Cage', 'Silver Tongue', 'Champaign Bath', and 'Broken'. 'APBE' and 'The Cage' are two of the fast speed metal tracks, while 'Gravenimage' and 'Broken' both sport unique, melodic overtones to them. 'Champaign Bath' is fast, fun metal that takes you for a hellova ride. Then there's two nice ballads to top the album off: 'The Misery' and 'Draw Me'. These ballads thankfully aren't syrup-drenched like a lot of ballads can get. There aren't any bad tracks in the bunch, and there's something to please anyone that is looking for variety.  Replayability: High. Makes for a perfect power metal fix.  WG proved to be a great starting point for me, and I highly suggest anyone else who sees this album in the stores to give it a shot. They also have a new album out, Reckoning Night(2005) as well as two earlier albums, Ecliptica(1999) and Silence, which many consider their best work. If WG is any indication, then I can't wait any longer to hit up on the other albums. One of the lyrics in the song 'Gravenimage' asks ""Can I still recognize a beautiful melody?"". Yes, you certainly can, and you're certainly one of the best bands in the business at it.   Other recommendations: -Any other Sonata Arctica album. ALL are outstanding. (judging by the soundclips) -'Visions' by Stratovarius -'Epica' and 'The Black Halo' by Kamelot -'Oceanborne', 'Wishmaster', and 'Century Child' by Nightwis"
1,I hate this band.THEY WERE THE LEAST RESPECTED GROUP IN THE 70'S.THE ONLY GROUP WHICH MATTERED IN THE 1970'S WAS PINK FLOYD.I JUST CANT UNDERSTAND THAT WHY IN 2006 WOULD PEOPLE WANT TO LISTEN TO THESE TALENTESS DI**HEADS WHEN THERE IS SO MUCH BETTER MUSIC AVAILABLE THAN THIS.GET PEARL JAM'S SELF TITLED ALBUM INSTEAD.BUY THIS STUPID ALBUM IF YOU ARE STILL LIVING IN 1970'S.ZERO STAR
2,"I loved ""Come Away With Me"" the first moment I heard it.  I also had the opportunity to see Norah and her wonderful band in concert ... the experience was absolutely FANTASTIC! I couldn't have asked for a better! So naturally I waited in eager anticipation for her new album ""Feels Like Home"" which after only one listen made me feel narcoleptic.  It was a good thing I didn't try and listen to it while driving.  To be perfectly honest, I haven't listened to it since. She is so talented, I wish this effort had been as successful as the first, but not everyone hits a homerun each time at bat. But I still hold out hope that her next album will be better"
5,"This is without a doubt the best texas music album I've ever heard, and quite possibly my favorite CD I own.  I just don't get tired of it.  There's simply not a weak song on the album, and there's a good variety of upbeat songs as well as slower, more somber ones.  Pick this one up. "
1,"I hate this CD. I have most of the other Chieftan CD's, and their collaboration with other artists has always worked in the past. This collection runs the gamut from mediocre to ludicrous. To paraphrase a line from Spinal Tap:&quot;There's a fine line between clever and stupid.&quot; This one's over the line.  &quot;Tears of Stone&quot; is my current fave"
4,"I saw them open for KISS in 76 and they blew me away. But for some reason I never bought any albums. I never heard them on the radio. I always thought they were  another Skynrd type band but they are NOT! They are just kick butt rock and roll! I love it! I love the live versions so much I wanna get the live album now. Reminds me of Saxon or UFO live. Awesome. I'm sorry I didn't listen to them before. Train TRain, Wishing Well, Queenie and the kickin' Good Morning are just killers! If you think they are just some southern band think again. Highly recommended for any hard blues rock fan. Buy Blackfoot"
5,"The SWEET shock a few of their fans here and jump from bubble-gum to Rock. From the first 30 seconds of track one ""Set Me Free"" for good or bad, you know those days are gone for ever. In the process they acquire an entirely new audience. The SWEET have attained their adolescence. Although they do not have total control (yet) of the final product, they are now penning many of the songs and are breaking free from the nest. This gives the band new energy and motivation which is evident in the final product. As adolescents, gone is the ""goodie two-shoes"" image. The topics now range from fast cars (Rebel Rouser) to bi-sexual women (AC-DC). In the 70's the ""moral majority"" still ruled over freedom of expression, so these subjects are dealt with some subtlety and an occasional bit of humour.  Oh yes the music...I could decipher the music for pages but I'll let YOU do it. Someone once wrote that SWEET was a fly by night, 3 chord churning and ""very limited talent wise"" band. Alright then ""smarty pants"", compare Pat Benatar's cover of the song ""No You Don't"" to the original SWEET version. Compare the drums, guitar and vocals. Then you can make-up your own mind...   GREAT STUFF!!! An excellent deal with all those extra tracks."
5,"""Berlin"",  which was Reed's follow-up to his highly succesful ( both musically and commercially ) 1972 album ""Transformer"", showcases a radical change in Reed's direction. Whereas ""Transformer"" was a mostty light and musically catchy album, ""Berlin"" is a more complex and darker album; both musically and lyrically.   No tracks have the commercial appeal which characterized many tracks on ""Transformer"", and the album contains no new hit-singles. The album works much better to be listened to as a whole, and only few tracks are suited for ""Best of"" compilations. Songs like ""Caroline Says"" and ""How Do Think it Feels"" would be the most obvious selections to put out. This doesn't mean that this is not good album; on the contrary; it may be his artistically most  successful. Musically it's very varied in style and instrumentation.   The ""Berlin"" theme seems to have influenced the arrangements of the two opening tracks; especially ""Lady Day"" ( Kurt Weil ).  The songs are generally longer than on Reed's two previous albums, but you are never bored when listening to the album; and once you have gotten to know the songs, you'll notice that it is really a very melodic album, with no unimportant tracks.  This is Reed's Dark Masterpiece"
2,"Gun in hand, formula of flesh and bury me were 3 excellent songs but the rest of the tracks on the album just sounded like filler. not really my kind of stuff i guess"
2,"Despite breaking through with the Kanye West-assisted This Way in 2004, Dilated Peoples have created a niche for themselves, devoid of mainstream hip-hop's frills and the eccentric creativity of the left-field. Their once-commendable stoicism now translates as banality, not aided by this lacklustre set, filled with beats that Eminem would be ashamed of. The malaise even extends to some very ordinary scratching from the usually impeccable DJ Babu, while it takes guest Talib Kweli to deliver the LP's best verse on Kindness For Weakness"
5,"I have had this videocassette for years and its so worn I'm so glad to finally get a CD!  Jewel's voice is beautiful and some of the classics like Joy to the World and O Little Town of Bethlehem are the best versions I have ever heard.  I could have done without the non-traditional songs which don't quite fit into the holiday arrangement or match the beauty of her voice but its well worth the purchase for Gloria, O Holy Night and Ave Maria. If you like to sing along, I highly recommend it."
4,"The Alice Cooper Band's second album sees the band still recording for Frank Zappa's label.  The music starts to turn in the direction of the material that would later make them famous.  No real macabre stuff yet, but the album is definitely a progression from their first one.  The album was produced by David Brigs who is probably best known for working with Neal Young.  The opening track, ""Mr. And Misdemeanor"" has always been a favorite of mine and a great example of Alice's talent for playing on words.  ""Shoe Salesman"", ""Below Your Means"", ""Return Of The Spiders"", and the short but cool ""Refrigerator Heaven"" are all good tunes.  The finale of ""Beautiful Flyaway"" and ""Lay Down And Die, Goodbye"" is also a great way to end things.  The Alice Cooper band would be signed to Capitol and hit the big time with their next release.  ""Easy Action"" would be a strong stepping stone to get to that point. "
4,"If you are looking for a disc with first-rate interpretations of some of the standards in brass band literature, this recording (and its somewhat more refined Volume 1) begs your attention.  All of the performances are extremely clean and precise, and the technical requirements of these works are often extensive.  There are the moments of overly sentimental playing and wobbly vibrato that was so off-putting to Vaughan Williams in his Henry V, but nothing outside of the standard practice in most British Brass Bands. "
2,first of All KRS-One is One of the Greatest Rappers&Story-Tellers Ever&Ain't nobody out now in Rap Can even Hold His Shoe Laces when He breaks things down.having said that&understanding He didn't fully want this Album out He still hasn't knocked me out with a Album all the way through in way over a Decade.He has had some tight Jams&of course His Flow still will just leave you dizzy but the Music&Subject matter are pretty much the same&He hasn't challenged His Full powers as a MC in quite some time.He still has the Words&Flow to Roll you over but Albums like this&others of recent time just don't even begin to do this Man Justice when you remember&Grew up on His Best stuff.but regardless I'll always listen to Him.He truly changed&Flipped the Game
1,"First of all, THE DELIVERY MAN isn't that much of an album.  Why would anyone want a bonus disc of bad remixes or live versions???  You folks are right - this reissuing business is just plain stupid.  I've been a Costello fan for over 25 years, but I'll tell you what, my collection stopped at the Ryko reissues!  As for the stuff he's put out since the Universal switch - I've burned them all off the copies that my local library system gets (at least one person on their buying staff is a Costello fan - ain't I lucky?).  Sorry E, but I spent too much of my (and other people's) money on buying these ""elusive"" rare tracks - that are still in print all these years later.  I'll believe this stuff is rare when Rhino ceases the bonus discs and just reissues the old catalog in their original 11-20 song discs.  In the meantime, I've got a box of old Costello 45s and picture sleeves for sale.  Any takers"
1,"This is the worst lp in recording history.  The covers are embarassingly bad, and especially their cover of Lou Reed's ""Sweet Jane"" which is down right hideous and I'd be suprised if Lou Reed wouldn't beat the living daylights out of all three of these losers if he ever saw them.  If you think Grand Funk Railroad covering the Stones' ""Gimmie Shelter"" was ridiculous, that's nothing; this is far, far worse.  As for their big hit single, ""Smoking in the Boys' Room"" here's a newsflash:IT'S a NOVELTY song, nothing more.  The rest of the songs are ""me wanna hump you"" caveman songs ineptly play that make Bad Company sound sophisticated.  I'm sorry Cub Koda died young, but there is a silver lining in that cloud: HE'S NOT RECORDING ANYMORE.  Rated 1 Star because ZERO wasn't available.  Avoid at all costs.  Unless you want a ten dollar mini frisbee that comes with a jewel case"
5,Doesn't get anymore classic than this ! Two legends just sitting down and doing what they do best
5,"There is mention of As Wichita Falls, so Falls Wichita Falls in the movie The Ice Harvest...does anyone know if there is definite connection between this album which is much older and the film which played around Christmas 2005? I am not big Metheny fan == was looking for something else when I ran across this album.."
4,"Really the thing that gets me is not Dolphy's playing at all.  It's Bobby Hutcherson's.  He is a master on this album, proving solo after solo that his taste is something to be reckoned with.  If you are a fan of the vibraphones, and want to hear them used the exact opposite of the way that the Modern Jazz Quartet used them, grab your keys, walk out of your door, lock your door, walk down the path in front of your house, out of your front yard, shutting the small latch on your gate, get in your car and go to a music store.  Once there, head to the jazz section and get this album.  Or, you know, click BUY.  Either way.  It'll work"
2,This band is more punk than rock with only somewhat easy flowing songs
2,"Wow! What a horrible album! Its tracks are filled with a bunch of predictable outcomes and very cheesy vocals. The only two tunes that I have found to be interesting were Eleven and Sydney. Eleven is actually my favourite tune. Gabriel & Dresden had the potential as they made some quality productions - although most of them were a bit too commercial, but still quility - throughout years 2002-2004. Then they released the awesome, their best in my opinion, track Arcadia. After the release of Arcadia, I just thought it couldn't get better than this - an awsome production without any of that cheesiness that you would find in their earlier works. But the reality was that from that point on it just went downhill for these two. And this album just proves it. All of these tracks are well done and finished, but too finished and too uncreative. It actually didn't surprise me after hearing their Essential Mix back in spring. Basically they have great production skills but absolutely no ideas. I would recommend just buying track Eleven on 12"" or mp3"
4,"I've always loved the way John Mayer takes his songs to the acoustic side of things and this album highlights that talent. The songs have a different feel to them. They don't sound as deep and emotional as the full orchestrated Continuum versions, but (with the exception of Waiting on the world to Change - which sounds identical to the Continuum version) both Belief and Slow Dancing (the two strongest on this album) have a more personal sound to them.  The production is spotless and it sounds as though the album was recorded in the studio as opposed to live, and result is a definite additon to your John Mayer collection.  The only fault I have is that there isn't a longer track listing"
5,8 years later and this album still rules. this is by far the best children of bodom album and hatebreeder comes in second with tokyo warhearts. don't waste your time with new bodom if you haven't heard the older stuff yet especially something wild because you will be missing out on what COB really are. Deadnight Warrior and Touch Like (the) Angel of Death amazing
4,"this disc is blazing but not quite as deep as Romantic Warrior.but still Chick,Al,Stanley&amp;Lenny give up the Rock,Jazz&amp;Funk and Fuse a strong brew here.Celebration Suite Part 1&amp;2 take this disc to another  Level.the Playing is very Intense&amp;tight.when folks say so&amp;so is one  of the Greatest Guitarist of All-Time they have to Include AL DiMeola. his  solos ain't no joke.Lenny solos and they are banging.Stanley is incredible  as usual&amp;Chick Corea has no-Limits"
2,"The mixing on some tracks is awful, and at one point, vocals are lost altogether on The Rascals track. I love this music -- the soundtrack of my college days -- so having it on one disc for traveling (I commute 50 miles round trip every day) is great, but the quality could be lots better"
5,"THE END OF THE INNOCENCE is Don Henley's other best solo album, along with BUILDING THE PERFECT BEAST. The title song, like ""The Boys Of Summer"" from the previous album, made me realize that looking good for my favorite actresses was more important than attending food-related reunions at my old school, especially since most of the staff I knew are gone and many of the changes there have not been for the better. ""I Will Not Go Quietly"" and ""New York Minute"" made me realize that looking at photos of attractive female celebrities is a good way to inspire myself to avoid an individual I've had issues with BEFORE I do myself in over it, whereas ""Little Tin Gods"" and ""If Dirt Were Dollars"" skewer hypocritical preachers and gossip columnists, respectively, and ""The Heart Of The Matter"", like the title song, is about letting go, whether of a lost love, a grudge, or your past. Overall, THE END OF THE INNOCENCE is an album with great music and multilayered lyrical messages. The fact that Henley believes that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indonesia on drug-smuggling charges was wrongfully convicted makes this album an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience "
5,"Its doubtful that there have been two jazz musicians more suited to record together than Ben Webster and Sweets Edison. Alumni of the Ellington and Basie bands respectively, these two mainstream swing players have marvelous  chemistry on this session. The charts are perfect vehicles for Webster's  warm tone and silky phrasing as well as Edison's blues-ridden melodic style  that matured in the mid and late 1950's. Most of the tunes swing hard  anchored by a solid Basie-esque rhythm section. You'll wear this one out"
5,"I have found that anything that Jegg Golub does is absolutely wonderful. He has managed to take artist like Eric Claptan, Johnny Lang, Stevie Ray Von, BB king, Seagar and the list goes on, and gives you alittle of  everyones style all in one song and then mixes his own style in to boot.  All of his work is a must hear. If you like soul, blues, and jazz. here ya  go. Brenda Burnet"
4,"This has 4 stone cold rock classics on it - Hotel California, New Kid in Town, Life in the Fast Lane and Victim of Love. For these songs alone the album deserves 4 stars. The rest I can pretty much do without. I'm not a big fan of the slower songs sung by Don Henley, such as Wasted Time and The Last Resort - he sounds much better singing the grittier rock songs. The guitar work throughout is amazing - i still get chills listening to the guitar solo on H.C. even after all this time. Felder and Walsh sound great together. I hear they're recording a new album for release late this year and it's a shame that Felder is no longer in the band. Anyone who plays guitar like he does is going to be missed, if not by the band then definitely by us listeners"
5,"Very nice collection of mid to late 60's top 40 tracks. First time true stereo on ""Love Is All Around"" and ""Whiter Shade Of Pale"", and even the ones you may have already sound better than ever. I might have left off ""Keep On Dancing"" for something that hasn't popped up on a dozen other compilations, but that's a minor gripe. I don't think that any oldies collector will be disappointed with this CD.  Like the other guy said, just buy it. "
5,"Bach wrote very, very few variation compositions like the ""Goldberg Variations,"" but the one's he wrote are most memorable and monumental.  Early in his career, he wrote a magnificant ""Aria with Variations in the Italian Manner"" (BWV989).  Its repeating aria at the end along with the alternating fast/bright and slow/contemplative variations foreshadowed a model in these so-called Goldberg Variations  - one of the towering 'summation works' Bach wrote late in his life at Leipzig.   With a full quiver of splendid recordings of Bach's keyboard music, it is not hard to believe that Angela Hewitt is the top-selling musical artist for the British Hyperion label.  And this recording of her personal favorite Golderg Variations is another worthwhile CD in the series.  Angela Hewitt's Goldbergs - and really all her Bach or Couperin in general - may be most simplistically characterized as having a more gentle, graceful and heartfelt style.  She particularly excells on bringing out the joyful rhythms in the many Baroque-era 'dances' and as well as the inherent songfulness within the music.  Technically, her smooth-as-silk long legato line, tasteful ornamental infusions, and intelligent progression all combine to create a delightful experience with Bach as heard in this fine recording.    Additionally, Hewitt is a master tonal colorist and is not shy to tactfully use the pedals and nuances of the modern piano to create a greater richness in the music - while taking care to avoid blurring her individual lines.  Accordingly, she elects a wide dynamic range for this recording to elicit maximum expressivity.  Where a pianist like Glenn Gould goes for maximum clarity of parts by completely avoiding the pedal (creating razor-sharp articulations within a very-forward recorded sound), Hewitt strives to balance crisp articulation with tonal beauty through such pianistic nuances as well as through a somewhat-spacious (but clear) recording ambiance.  Her creativity in ornamentation and well-chosen shifts of tempo in the repeats (which she observes here) adds stylistic interest - but without straying too far from Bach's musical intentions.   In comparison to other Goldberg recordings (such as Perhahia's Award-Winning disc), Angela Hewitt's readings here seems to possess a more introspective, pensive tone and mood overall. Perhaps in the back of her mind she is tempering her expression in light of the legend that Bach wrote these pieces for his student Goldberg to play at night to help his employer, the insomniac Count Keyserling, pass the time during his sleepness nights.  Hewitt's expressivity in the opening and closing Aria is as expected, thoughtful and beautiful.  But, in the famous 25th ""Black Pearl"" Variation, she creates a somewhat veiled atmosphere with a slower tempo not unlike a funeral march.  Personally, I felt it a bit too heavy rather than the more poignant and optimistic mood of Perahia - but such is art and individual preference.  Contrastingly, in the brilliant fast variations, Miss Hewitt brings an ebulient clarity and precision to the music that is refreshing to mind and spirit.  But, it is not the fully unleashed joy that Murray Perahia finds (in movements like the first variation) which overflow with a special vivacity.  But Hewitt's readings here overall are no less enjoyable or admirable as such nuances are often purely personal.  I tend to prefer Perahia's sparkling version on a sunny morning and Hewitt's more contemplative recording when reading late at night.  Other notable Goldberg recordings come from the Bach legend Rosalyn Tureck whose recordings are often a model for any serious student of the piano. Hungarian pianist Andras Schiff has also recorded some gorgeous Bach that often has a similar ""sweetness"" of style as Hewitt.  As for Glenn Gould, his landmark 1955/1982 recordings rightfully caused a stirring in the music world and have a striking individuality and brilliantly clear articulation of voices (assuming you don't mind his intermittent humming and the less-than-perfect sound quality).  Many others have also given great performances.  Hewitt's Goldberg CD received strong ratings from from many of the top reviewers like Penguin Guide and Gramophone and stands with a few others among the finer recordings.  ClassicsToday was a bit more critical, giving this CD a rating of 8/10 for Artistic Quality and 9/10 for Sound Quality (noting a tendency for emotive restraint in some variations).  I mostly agree with this last (8/10) assessment - out of Hewitt's Bach discography, I found her Goldbergs very enjoyable but just not quite as magical as her others.  But, an additional highlight of this Hyperion CD is surely the superbly annotated notes revealing some history of this music and Ms. Hewitt's musical insights and approaches to each of the 30 variations.  The notes alone might make Hewitt's CD preferable to others if you already have a version you really like.  All-in-all, a most attractive and admirable recording (4.5 stars); but, like other reviewers and Gramophone conclude, Perahia's sparkling version (5 stars) strikes me as very special and takes top honors here in my opinion"
1,"With the exception of Missy, and Lil kim track, this whole cd will make a great coaster at best. The only who can truly enjoy this album is someone who has a one track mind for partyin' only. This is no hip hop compilation. Straight dance to the fullest. Pop for the most part. And tracks of hits that i didn't even no was hits, by a rapper almost no one cares about. Even though I do like some of what he puts out but still, addin yourself on hits album just make people diss him more"
5,"I agree with other reviewers here -- much of the music on the CD is simply supplemental to the film, is forgetable, nothing really stands out, there is a lack of melody.  Only one track (# 14) ""My Name is Lincoln"" -- stands apart, offering a theme, melody, choir and resolution -- it is a signature bit of composing that, for me, is really worth the price of the CD"
5,"I have to say that I prefer Handel's Tamerlano for musical reasons. However, Vivaldi's opera on the same subject is very enjoyable and entertaining. Like it has been said of the operas of Haydn, Vivaldi's operas are not great operas, but they do contain great music.  Europa Galante, directed from the 1st violin by Fabio Biondi, is in great form and I've never heard them play better. I have their older recording of Handel's opera Poro, and I enjoyed that one, too.  The singers here are an excellent ensemble. I like the dark and expressive voice of Ildebrando D'Arcangelo - he was also marvellous as Leporello in Gardiner's Don Giovanni. David Daniels is fantastic, as usual, and he is possibly the best operatic countertenor in the world at the moment. Patrizia Ciofi is best heard and not seen - sweet voice coming from a madwoman (check out the DVD!). Vivica Genaux has been hyped to within a centimetre of her life recently. She has a nice flexible mezzo voice. A little too much vibrato for my tastes and she looks like a chipmunk when she attacks coloratura passages. Marijana Mijanovic sings well - she was excellent as the neurotic Penelope in the Christie / L.A.F. DVD of Monteverdi's Il Ritorno d'Ulisse in patria. She is alarmingly thin - possible health problems? She doesn't engage with the conductor or orchestra at all in the DVD - the only singer who doesn't. Elina Garanca looks beautiful (and healthy!) and sings beautifully. She has a lovely contralto voice. I hope I see and hear more from this artist in the future.   I am not a big fan of Vivaldi's operas - I enjoy them as collections of arias. I wonder how well Bajazet worked on stage? I'd love to have a DVD of this production, I would like to see how a Vivaldi opera works on stage. Vivaldi's operas don't have imaginative scorings and the orchestral passages are fairly prosaic. A lot of what goes on in the Vivaldi operas I've heard (I have a few in my CD collection) is pretty routine. However, I am open minded on the subject and I would like to see how well a Vivaldi opera works on stage."
5,"Melanie White and other reviewers have wondered what else out there might be similar to ""Appalachia Waltz."" I highly recommend Oliver Schroer's double-disc ""O2"". Same fusion of folk fiddle idiom and classical violin. In places astoundingly brilliant. Lovers of Bach will see many influences here (yet I wouldn't call Schroer's work derivative.) In the liner notes, Schroer talks about making his work not just polyphonic but also fractal--funny thing is, the more you listen, the more ""fractal"" it sounds. Unbelievable."
5,"A wonderful CD with the power to thoroughly relax even the most stressed-out people. Easy enough for background playing during dinner or a conversation, and serious enough to be full of magic when listening to it  exclusively. Great buy at a great price"
1,Beef is an excellent source of protei
1,It is laughable to read some of these other reviews. But whats not funny is how bad 50 Cent is. He is the worst rapper of all time a total disgrace to hip hop music. He has no love for the music only for the money. I don't know how he sells so many records but that just shows how many people don't know real music
5,"Carpenter really knew what he was doing when he got Walker to help with the score.  Makes super background music for Quake II.  The sounds are FAR more detailed than in EFNY.  It's the bomb, as they say.  I've had it for  two months, and I still get a kick out of the main theme and the motorcycle  chase.  Kudos, Carpenter"
5,"i had a very colicky baby from 2 weeks old to 10 weeks old and this was the best cd of all the ones i tried (classical, lullabye, ocean sounds, television, etc) to calm my baby and most importantly, to keep him sleeping longer. the last track was his favorite, the sound of the rain. he sleeps so much longer now that i play that track on ""repeat"" all night long. and i can get things done during his naps because the rain sound covers up the noise of me in the kitchen, etc. And, when he is really cranky and there's nothing else i can do for him, i can put him down in his bed and play the whole cd from start to finish and it calms him and puts him to sleep 75% of the time, which is a huge improvement from other attempts."
5,"I've never written a review for anything (I'm pretty sure). It's just like: ""Whatever"" to me, but I read some guy's review of Keep it Like a Secret by Built To Spill (by the way: couldn't recommend that album any more highly. Buy it now.). I lost my train of thought, but  Here's what I'm getting at:  This album changed my life. Not even kidding.  Besides, maybe, Giant Steps, this is the most important piece of music of all time. Of all the time in my life, of course. I don't know about yours.  Do me a favor and pick it up now.  Seriously, I couldn't even quantify or qualify the effect this album has on me with words or numbers or any other means of expression beyond this: This album changed my life.  Seriously, you don't even get it.  God man, I've been listening to this album since I was in second grade. My all time favorite.  Buy Ruby Vroom, too. Stay away from El Oso. And Mike Doughty's solo stuff. I mean, get it if you want. I don't care.   Just go read some Soul Coughing lyrics. Just take like, 2 minutes out of your day. You're not even doing anything important right now. Are you? No.  http://scug.net/, man. Thats all. Just go there. Read some of the words. Look at the pictures.  Seriously, you don't even get it. I took the liner notes out of the case (which I lost) and taped them to my wall. I'm not even kidding.   sigh  aklsjdfl;asjkdfkl;asdj   -wilso"
1,"I am so dissapointed in this CD. I bought it because I have ""Blow By Blow"" and ""Jeff Beck with the Jan Hammer Group"" and I love those CDs. This crap sounds like somebody that heard those recordings, practiced for one week and tried to do an imitation of them. I don't like one cut on the entire CD. I only gave it one star because I couldn't find a way to give it less."
2,"judging by the clips offered from amazon, this cd sounded like it could be as good as gba material, but i was dissapointed after the first spin, and i haven't put it back in since. It's not bad stuff, just that the jams are  lacking in creativity, and the true funk feel is missing. Try Greyboy  allstars(who are the BEST live), or try the next level in jambads: PHISH"
5,I love every kind of music and I recently was introduced to Tom Waits. My faviorte genre is metal but I cant stop listening to this guy. His voice is amazing and all his songs are wonderful. Pasties And A G-String (At The Two O'Clock Club) and Step Right Up are my faviorte on this cd. I own a few other cds by Waits and I have yet to hear this guy make a bad song
2,"This performer deserves all the latitude necessary, as she may yet develop into a relevant, insightful, and original interpreter of the music she offers. I truly hope she does not choose to compete with Eliot Fisk in the Indy-500 or the 24-Hours of Le Mans. Based on the samples, I won't be buying this CD as I can program my computer to play just as fast or even faster, and just as clear. Instead, I recommend the Frank Bungarten recording (also available on Amazon). But Ana Vidovic does show a lot of promise, and deserves encouragement"
5,"Un poco triste que Reyli ya no forme parte de ELEFANTE. En este disco nos muestra (aun mas) su gran talento pero como solista.  Sus canciones: ""Amor del bueno"", ""Desde que llegaste"" y ""Calma"" son hermosas.  Y quien no ha escuchado el tema musical, ""La descarada"", de la muy popular telenovela Rubi? Comprenlo hoy"
2,Aphrodite must have been preoccupied when he mixed this one. For the most part the tracks drag on with no end in sight or build toward some invisible (and unmelodic) climax. There are a few with powerful beats and creative touches such as tracks 14 featuring Jungle Brothers and 13 featuring N.W.A. But for the most part the rappers take center stage and Aphrodite doesn't add much. If you really want to sample his talent buy his self titled CD
1,"I List Hezekiah Walker , Donnie McClurckin and Micah Stampley as gospel vocalist with the most range and you hear how much range he has at the end of lift him up, he is almost singing soprano. This album takes awhile to get used to.There is a Mix between live songs and studio songs, different from all of the rest of Walkers' albums.My favorite song is lift him up, and im pretty much satisfied with the album because it lifts me up when i listen to it.I was  blessed to see Hezekiah Walker live and he sung lift him up, ive played in my car ever since and its hard not to shout off of it.I must say I like the live recordings better because i love live instruments .The one thing i must say is that Hezekiah Walker does not dissapoint and his music is about ministry and not about all the technical stuff that musicians and song writers worry about. Hez carries an anointing nobody else carries, he is a pastor first and a singer second, his albums are not about lyrics there about ministry and lifting up jesus.so if you are someone that cares more about lyrics than anointing you might want to  try someone else whose anointing is not as powerful as Hezekiah Walker"
4,"As ballad pop goes, Journey is there. These are the songs which were played at proms throughout the 1980s. Filled with romance, emotional passion and Steve Perry's unrelenting voice, Journey's ""The Essential Journey"" are a mix of hard, mild and melodic pop rock.   Occasionally, the band would turn out mediocre music, like ""Girl Can't Help It,"" but most is still worth listening to. ""Be Good to Yourself"" sounds like a bad movie soundtrack song, and is not worthy of this otherwise amazing CD.  There are two disks, with more music than the average listener is familiar with, and only hardcore fans with know. A few hits are missing, leaving a real best-of CD still out there.  Journey was a pop band: Simple lyrics without a heavy message. Distinguishing them was their willingness to step out of the known musical formulas. Club music was coming into its own in the 1980s, with DJs sampling and mixing. Their music doesn't sample well, and they risked being a radio-only band. As their hit list grew from ""Lovin' Touchin' Squeezin'"" into a rich repertoire, their concerts became packed into stadiums. Those are the songs here.   It is 1980s music in every sense of the term, but better than just as music from the period, just like James Taylor is better than just being a musician from the 1970s. I fully recommend, ""The Essential Journey"" by Journey.   Anthony Trendl  editor, HungarianBookstore.co"
5,"This is a great CD with the Dance Movements being my favorite.  UNT plays wonderully, intonation is great.  Highly recommended band literature"
5,"This album is fantastic.  I can't really compare it to other Melvins albums since they all have something different about them, but take my word for it that this one is great.  This one is unique from every other Melvins release for two reasons:  1.  They have a second drummer on this thing, and  2.  There are TONS of vocal harmonies in this album.  My thoughts on both:  The two drummers thing, awesome, the fills and solos are amazing, I never thought they'd find a way to make Dale Crover's work even better, turns out they did, they had another amazingly talented guy drum with him.  Its astounding.  If you play the drums, you need to hear this album.  The vocal harmonies thing, really cool too.  It makes the sound very unique, gives it another layer.   All that said, the album itself is also unlike the other Melvins albums in that most of it is really fast.  The Melvins are characteristically famous for their sludgey, slow sound.  They still toss out a few slow numbers here, but by and large its chock full of incredibly intelligent, speedy metal songs.  And they're awesome!  The Melvins sound great playing fast!  The intro to ""The Hawk"" just TEARS!!!  I don't even know how to compose my thoughts about this album other than to say it carries the fine Melvins tradition of doing something to vastly alter their sound on every album, and also, its fantastic.  It rocks so hard.  I mean, if you thought The Maggot was an awesome fistfull of metal, check out A Senile Animal, its even better.  I should also point out that this is probably their best starter album.  Meaning that if you don't own any Melvins albums and never heard of them, this one is the best place to start.  I know it's not their classic sludge sound, but the Melvins are not an accessable band.  Their music, while intelligent, awesome, and incredibly powerful, takes a while to figure out.  You have to give the Melvins a good couple of listens before it just sort of clicks in your head and you realize how brilliant these guys can be.  Take their self titled album (or ""Lysol"" to the diehards), for example.  Its a great brilliant Melvins album; one of their best, as most fans will tell you.  But if you were trying to expose someone who's never heard of the Melvins to their music, you wouldn't dare start them out with Lysol, it would go right over their heads.  So thats why its nice to see a Melvins album like ""A Senile Animal"" come out, becuase the intelligenece and the power is still there, but overall its a much easier experience to wrap your brain around.  So thank you, Melvins, for making yet another wonderful, unique, challenging-yet-still-accessable (not to mention HEAVY) album.  And those of you reading this not knowing a thing about the Melvins, buy this album.  If you're a metal fan and you have half a brain, you'll love it.  Then pick up The Maggot, Stoner Witch, and Houdini.  Now that you realize that this is one of the best musical acts still performing today, go for the golden material with Gluey Portch Treatments, Bullhead, and Lysol.    As a side point, how can Buzz still be doing this?  Its been like two decades and he's STILL making some of the best metal riffs in existance.  How can you go that long, putting out album after album, and still be tossing out all these fantastic, wonderfully heavy metal riffs left and right?  Its inhuman"
2,"Hate to admit it but this just isn't very good.  Been a fan since 'Slowhand' so i've been frequently disappointed and underwhelmed by Clapton, but this is just amazing.  This has everything going for it but it just doesn't come together.  The featured review by 'Woomer' mirrors my feelings that nothing since 'From the Cradle' has been worthwhile barring 'Riding with the King' and that was helped immensely by King himself.  Toss this onto the heap along with 'Reptile' and 'Pilgrim'"
1,"Unless one considers ""Planet Waves,"" Dylan's 1974 studio album with the Band playing backup, to be a Band album, ""Cahoots"" has no competition for the title of the worst Band album ever. Yes, the first two tracks are good (""Life is a Carnival"" - great rhythms, great horns, OK lyrics; and Dylan's ""Masterpiece"" -- does nothing for me, but I understand many people love it), but they are available on other compilations, so the reason to shell out for ""Cahoots"" has to reside in the remaining tracks if anywhere, and they are AWFUL. The songs, that is, not the performances. The boys sing and play as well as ever, but their efforts -- particularly some fine Danko vocals and Hudson horn playing -- are wasted on songs that are utterly tuneless, charmless and brainless. There is not a single memorable musical phrase on tracks 3-11. Nor do the bonus tracks on this reissue rescue the enterprise: all are either available elsewhere in equivalent or superior versions or are unworthy of inclusion on anything (a RADIO COMMERCIAL?!). Save your money for any of the worthier products of this wonderful group of musicians"
5,"The fact that this CD includes the stunningly-beautiful ballad ""Miracles Need Wings To Fly"" should provide incentive enough to buy it. This great compilation brings most of Teena's greatest romantic ballads together for the first time--and at a budget price. Given her enormous talent, it's (almost) incredible that Teena has rarely gotten the mainstream recognition she naturally deserves. If you can only get one Teena Marie CD this is definitely THE one"
5,"I'm probably looking for something different than proper techno-heads, but I found that the entire album is good dancing music (Latin...think Cha Cha or Samba if you're REALLY athletic) or at least fun to listen to. My favorite by far is #5, of course"
2,"This time around, we get a fair amount of 7"" versions and edits. Track times:  1. Born to be Alive (6:05) (12"" edit) 2. rock your baby (6:26) 3. you make me feel mighty real (5:29) 4. don't leave me this way (5:43) 5. macho man (5:14) 6. in the bush (3:35) (7"") 7. hot shot (3:34) (7"") 8. bad girls (4:59) (album version) 9. he's the greatest dancer (6:15) 10. planet rock (6:24) 11. swearin to god (4:04) 12. this time baby (5:53)(edit"
5,"This is my favorite of her two Albums and one of my favorite CDs in my entire collection. I love devitional music, and this album is totally upbeat with tastefully interwoven Flamenco guitar, Indian Percussion, Tablas, among more modern sounding back-beats, and dance grooves. Perfect for meditation, Yoga, and even Just Getting Inspired. To me this Album has a whole lot of Aries/Libra Balance about it. It has a very FREEDOM LOVE feeling about it and yet it is very clear, balanced and awake. This album, I hated the first time I listened to it! So I sold it. The second time I listened to it, I was absoluetly shocked to Love it, and It is now one of my most favorite albums, and more frequently listened to, without ever getting sick of it. Maybe that is how I love it so much. Somehow this album merged with me in a non-conscious way, and totally snuck up on me! Wow, A very magical abum of peace and freedom in Devotional Modern Style~ very  Very Highly recommended."
1,"This is sabotage rather than a tribute to Tupac.  This doesn't do him justice.  Listening to this CD, I thought of ""This is Spinal Tap"" - the part where they have the miniature version of stonehenge, and everyone is looking around thinking ""what the hell is going on?""  That must have been how Tupac felt at this show.  The part of the CD where you can actually hear someone flipping through ""all eyez on me"" trying to find the right song...that was when I knew this CD was crap.  Tupac put great pride into the quality and sound of his work.  This is an abomination.  Well, what more can you say?  Death Row needed a little extra holiday bling, I guess.... My recommendation - don't buy it.  You might as well just listen to All Eyez on Me and sing along. "
1,"22 stellar reviews of this, I am flabbergasted.  I looked this up because we were talking about it on a messageboard:  patrick posted this on Aug 25th, 2006 at 09:59:53 am this looks and sounds ill in a conceptual way, it doesn't sound like Steppenwolf, right?  Peter**********IsDead posted this on Aug 25th, 2006 at 05:56:23 pm Steppenwolf have a few bangers, c'mon  and one of the best LP covers ever - [IMAGE]  i cant find a good size pic of it but if you own it you know PERFECT 70s dirtbag vibe on the cover  the_real_***** posted this on Aug 25th, 2006 at 07:11:16 pm that Steppenwolf-Monster LP has songs called Fag, Monster and Suicide, has the best cover art ever and it still totally sucks.  Negative*** posted this on Aug 25th, 2006 at 07:56:21 pm I was all stoked when I picked up monster at a garage sale. I owned it for less then 3 hours before I put it in the trash. The cover is GREAT though.  youth****** posted this on Aug 25th, 2006 at 09:18:05 pm Those song titles (Steppenwolf) are incredible beyond belief.   diffrn't strokes I gues"
5,a Solid Title here because not only are the Songs Here Very Soulful&Timeless but the Artists Featured here are whose who that Brought Soul Music out.back in a time Period when it was a Honored to Be Called SoulFul.these Songs Represent a time Period that Brought out the Best in R&B Radio
4,"Like others have said this cd is much more harder than City of Evil, and a little harder than Waking the Fallen, but still is a good cd. If your a new fan of A7X, I would suggest getting City Of Evil first, but don,t overlook this cd"
5,"Mid Eighties SST indie rock classic! This was the very first Sonic Youth album I owned. I got the vinyl in 87 at the age of 15 and it blew my mind and has ever since! The best song on the album in my opinion, and one of Sonic Youth's best songs period is ""Expressway to yr Skull,"" aka ""Madonna, Sean and Me,"" aka  ""The crucifixion of Sean Penn."" Whatever title you prefer, this song is a beautiful, powerful masterpiece that hits you in the soul every time. It's the most special melodic guitar masterpiece I have ever heard. Chiming scree infused with bliss, It builds to a mind melting crescendo and goes completely over the top, then the way the bass, drums and guitar work together into the mind bending recovery is aural art for sure. If you are lucky enough to hear it live you are in for a religous experience. On the vinyl it ended side 2 with a locked groove, meaning that when your turntable needle reached the end of the song instead of running out and ending it went around in a circle, playing the droning end of the song forever or until you turn it off.  While ""Expressway"" is a highlight, the rest of the album is awesome as well. Lyrically and sonically one of the things the sonics were into at the time this was recorded was the psychology and mythos surrounding the manson family and that era,  but that is only one aspect of this album. Another interesting thing about this album is the atmosphere it creates; many of the songs are different from one another sonically, yet the album is cohesive. Songs like ""In the Kingdom #19,"" with its narrative style and crazy stuff going on in the background evoking thoughts of D.Boon's tragic death, and ""Marilyn Moore,"" and ""Shadow of a Doubt"" just transport you atmospherically. I have recommended this album to many new listeners of SY, some find that they don't like it as much as ""Sister"" at first, because many of the songs aren't as ""immediately accessible"" as the gems of that album,  but with more listens it rewards them, it grows on them and they like it as much or more. Bublegum is a cover, I believe of an old Kim Fowley song and was not on the original release, but was a B-side (of the Starpower single if I remember correctly) added in the CD age. It seems somewhat out of place, especially following expressway. In any event, this recording is one of SY's best, and in my opinion one of the best period. Buy it, it's magical. "
5,"I loved this album when I first heard it in 1993. Since then, nothing Blues Traveler has created can compare, really. It all pales in comparison. For the best Blues Traveler you'll ever hear (although it would be nice if that weren't the case), get this CD"
5,"Without the soulful voice of Richard Manuel, this album would be drowning in MOR. But he lifts the music into an indescribably emotional area - Right as Rain, Georgia on my mind particularly. He performed almost the same miracle on Northern Lights, Southern Cross. Maybe Islands contains markedly inferior songs and some lacklustre performances, but it is nowhere near as bad as it has been painted. Listen to Richard..."
2,"While I purchased the CD for the title song, I was a little disappointed in the rest of the CD. I guess I didn't know the group's repertoire as well as I thought"
2,"I have tested this CD several times and the results came out the same: I still could not sleep. It must work for some, based on the other reviews, but I found the melodies distracting if not annoying."
2,"I was very excited to own this album knowing that this was a jazztronica album from one of the ECM masters. After struggling to listen to this album several times I have to say Molvaer would do better to stick to the more straight ahead, or perhaps find another producer for such outings. The electronic textures and ambience are fine, and the playing is nothing less than you would expect. Really it's just the beats that make this album unlistenable to me. Extremely cheesy and extremely cliche. My friend commented to me that it reminds him of a 90's movie soundtrack. I think that's about right. Molvaer is a great player, but he's a bit out of touch with some of the genres he was hoping to capture on this record. For jazztronica I would go with Dave Douglas' ""Freak In"" or the aforementioned E.S.T"
2,"2 and a half stars.  This is not an accurate representation of Bay Area Hip-Hop. It's a mediocre attempt in trying to appeal to the mainstream audience. Bay Area artists that signed major deals never made an album that was creatively better than their independent releases. Don't waste your time with this record and buy his last album ""I Give You My Word"".  Highlights of ""The Rock""- Frisco Stand Up, Planet Fillmoe, So Young, Way More Than They Can See, Pimps & Hustlas"
2,I bought this for my mom and even though she's a big fan she only liked the first 5 songs. The second disk is a complete snooze
2,"I bought Usher's 8701 on tape long ago, and I remember liking it. Then a couple of years ago, I bought it again on cd, listened to it, and wondered why I wasted my money.  Maybe it's the fact that I've grown, but this album sounds so un-soulful now. It is just lacking any spirit, sort of like an over-produced record: all studio magic, but no magic from the singer. Even the songs that are SUPPOSED to sound heartfelt, don't. The album sounds dated, not transcendent of time and era like all the albums that become classics. The songs are very forgettable, and I don't see any of them being seen as classics twenty years from now.  Usher has yet to make a masterpiece.  Addendum: I was a little unfair in my rating. The album deserves 3 stars, not 2. Unfortunately, I can't change it."
1,"This presentation of Mr. Boone's deserves a 1 for effort, a 5 for the best bad thing I've ever heard.  He made of mess of Little Richard's ""Tutti Fruitti"" way back when.  So, in keeping with such destruction, he went after our precious metal hits.  Funny stuff, though.  I keep thinking of the those sad off the strip casino bands trying to entertain folks who just want a $1.99 breakfast and a win at the nickel machines. "
2,"Conventional Karaoke titles use CD-G formats.  This should have been labelled a Disney Sing along Album.  Printed lyrics do not make a Karaoke CD which is entirely misleading the general consumer.  Fortunately the variety of songs and quality of the recordings still give a strong entertainment value for your child.  If you want the variety of Disney music, here it is.  If you want a sing along album, especially if you do not have a Karaoke player, you have your wish.    If you want a Karaoke format, look elsewhere. "
1,"I can not believe this is marketed as a karaoke CD!  This is just a regular music CD with the lyrics inside the package.  The lyrics do NOT show up on the TV screen when put into the karaoke machine.  No fun at all if you have to hold the microphone with one hand the the lyrics in another, under good light because the type is so small!!!!  Oh yeah, great fun for a 6 year old.....NOT!!"
1,"I like most of AC/DC's music, but I can't stand their latest album Stiff Upper Lip.  Stiff Upper Lip is the only AC/DC album where you can play it all the way through, and not even hear one good song.  Stiff Upper Lip doesn't even come close to being as good as Back in Black or Highway to Hell.  Every song on it just bugs the heck out of me.  Listening to one song off this album is enough to test my patience; but enduring all 12 of these musical abominations is enough to drive me crazy!  The overall sound is very similar to their earlier albums like Highway to Hell or Back in Black.  BUT...those CDs had variety, they were semi original, and they were actually pretty good.  THIS CD is just completely worthless.  I have heard some cra ppy CDs in my lifetime, but none of them were more pain to listen to than this.  The vocalist sounds about 10 times worse than he did on their earlier albums, the music is chunky, repetitive, dull, and boring, and most of the songs sound the same. Stiff Upper Lip is so bland and dull sounding that it sounds more like the monotonous droning of an electric fan than a rock n roll band.  The music is so repetitive and similar sounding that its more like listening to the same annoying song for 60 minutes than 12 separate tracks.  This CD is just unbelievaby terrible.  It is a disgrace to this band's legacy, and the band members should be embarrased by it.  Oh well, I guess they probably only made this album because they needed to fulfill their record contract, so I guess they don't care about how awful it is anyway.  All I can tell you potential buyers is to stay as far away from this piece of garbage as possible.  It is a TOTAL piece of cr ap and it is not fit to listen to.  Go buy a GOOD AC/DC CD like Let there Be Rock, High Voltage, Powerage, Highway to Hell, or Back in Black.  Stiff Upper Lip suc ks so hard it leaves a big purple bruise.  It's so awful I'd rather listen to the new Nickelback CD than this!"
2,"They had a swagger at Monterey 67 and were in the right place at the right time.  I like about 3 tracks on this album (their first and best).  I can't recommend it to the masses, I purchased this mainly for historical purposes.  You MUST listen to Jefferson Airplane (first 2 albums only), Peanut Butter Conspiracy (first 2 albums only), Grateful Dead (skip first 2 ablums) before you dig this deep for lost nuggets"
5,"Pat Benatar is a natural. This compilation has been thoroughly reviewed, so I will focus on four very different songs. Her phenomenal voice comes piercing through on ""Heartbreaker,"" a jaunty tune with catchy lyrics & intense energy. In ""I need a lover,"" she deciphers a females self-awareness that is rarely heard from in this genre of music. ""We Live For Love,"" is a smooth sensual song that appeals to the romantic in all of us. This one is good for dancing or driving on a breezy autumn day. ""Hell Is For Children,"" a deeply disturbing tune with its descriptions of child abuse. It brings out any decent persons protectiveness towards kids everywhere. Lastly, in ""Love Is A Battlefield."" She takes the listener on a roller coaster ride of emotions. The honest lyrics & her perfect delivery makes one ponder the title. All of her fans will be pleased with this entire compilation. It has no flaws"
2,"I was very excited to own this album knowing that this was a jazztronica album from one of the ECM masters.

5,"Whatever happened to melody, creativity, individuality and good old  beats?  Somewhere along the line it has been replace by singers who can't sing, write or play an instrument, songs without melodies and beats as monotonous as a flywheel.  Fortunately the Eurythmics are of the former school - turning out original, quality hits that showed a spark of genius at times.  (""Sweet Things"" is perhaps the most famous song of the decade - deservedly so.) The haunting voice, odd instrumentation and artistic approach to every track makes this one a winner.  My grade: "
5,"I'm writing this review to respond to a reviewer's frustrations that the liner notes he received were those belonging to the ""Sweet Dreams"" album.  This happened to me as well when I bought the CD from Borders.  So, I got a refund for it, bought a copy from Barnes and Noble, and the same thing happened.  Finally, I took my money to Best Buy, and found the correct liner notes!  So, the Barnes and Noble/Best Buy shipments must have been faulty.  For those interested in purchasing the album, I found it quite enjoyable.  I'm too young to have had the original LPs, so any bonus tracks released were nice to have.  I found the photos intriguing as well, once I had the correct booklet!  In my opinion though, it was worth the effort to have the correct liner notes"
2,"Jim Messina has played in a some great bands. He played in the Buffalo Springfield, a group of young legends.  He also played in Poco, probably the most under-appreciated and under-rated band of the era.  With these credentials, you can put Messina's name up there with the likes of Stills, Furay, Young, Nash, Crosby, Frey and Browne.  Then he teams up with Kenny Loggins, and things get bad.  I picked up this album, expecting greatness from these two, and I simply didn't find it.  What I found was two decent tunes surrounded by silly and annoying pop.  Most songs on here have simple lyrics, and are over-produced.  I do like two songs on here.  ""Till The Ends Meet"" is a nice, easy tune, and Loggins sounds very nice on this one.  The other song I like is ""Angry Eyes."" The intro is very cool, and the singing interplay between Loggins and Messina is fun and interesting here.  The main point here is that this album does not live up to expectation in the least.  There's no folk, no country rock, no free and easy feeling to this one.  This is blatant pop-music.  If you like bouncy pop, this might be for you.  If you're looking for anything like Poco or Buffalo Springfield, you will experience a huge bummer."
5,"Mr. Farlow came along years before Wes Montgomery, and never achieved Wes's level of mass appeal. Listen to this 1956 album, however, and you will be amazed. This expanded CD has 63 swinging minutes of guitar, piano and bass, but the trio sounds like a quintet at least. The old standards are recognizable, the tunes written without lyrics are interesting, and the absence of horns or drums isn't noticed at all. I wanted this when it was an LP but never got my hands on it. I have coveted it on CD the last few years, looking for a bargain price, but finally settled on something close to full retail. It's worth it. Enjoyable all the way through, I could see how a real guitar lover might declare this to be his favorite jazz disc ever. I expect to hear this one a lot over the next year or two, and to be fully satisfied. Read the other reviews posted here for &quot;why&quot; it works, and &quot;how&quot; Tal was so good. As a non-musician, all I can say is &quot;This one is great fun and what 50's jazz was all about.&quot"
2,"I love Morton Feldman. I have a lot of his music, and I especially like the Second String Quartet. Triadic Memories leaves me indifferent. It may be the performance, I don't know. But the music is boring. And repeat listenings only confirm my experience"
1,"Let me start by putting out a couple of my biases before getting into this review-- first, I relaly don't care for remixes as a rule, unless they're dramatic and severely restructure a song, I generally find they add little. Second, I really don't care for ""The Hand That Feeds"".  Having said that, the piece is presented in three mixes, the album version, the Straight mix, and the Dub mix. The album version has a catchy, circular guitar line and a straightahead drum beat that's actually decent until the bridge with this bizarrely irritating spoken wordish section. Just doesn't work.  The remixes fare no better-- the Straight mix adds different rock beats and an extended introduction that eventually becomes tedious, the dub mix layers a grating sustained guitar note over a beat and a mumbled repeated take on the chorus.  If you're a fan, get it. If not, skip this one, there's good reasons it wasn't released in the U.S"
5,"When you're young, it's quite fashionable to bemoan the lack of authentic individuals. When you grow older, you learn that you were correct. My Cherokee ancestors believe that adulthood begins at 51, and as I get closer to that age, I realize how right they are. Well, here's an individual for you. Slim Gaillard.   I have a four-CD set called LAUGHING IN RHYTHM. 1937 through 1952 from one of the great innovators in jazz. Musically creative, technically skillful, always soulful, lyrically hilarious, and perhaps an example of somebody under age 51 achieving adulthood. I can't stop listening to it. At home, in my MP3 player on the buses of China... Lemme get nuts here. If you ignore every other review I've ever written, note these three words. ""Buy this one."" It's like that, folks. Slim is da bomb."
5,"What can you say - this is a PERFECT song. There is not a flawed moment in it. I, too heard this on the Before Sunset trailer and was mesmerized by its beauty. Makes ME swoon. Love it"
1,Making it no reason to even consider getting this filler filled P.O.S
5,"Dante XXI  What a fantastic album! A huge achievement by a band that continues to produce excellent music despite a huge amount of criticism from fans of Cavalera-era Sepultura.  It's surprising that people can't get over the fact that Max Cavalera left a whole decade ago. Since then Sep have moved on and I doubt they would have made Dante XXI had Max still been at the helm. Frankly, bands should be applauded for pushing the boundaries of themselves and their fans. If you follow a band, it's sometimes worth having a little faith in them, I feel. I guess we fall in love with a band after hearing a couple of albums and that those albums become the band. But the band themselves have a totally different perspective! The music they produce is a product of the dynamics of the members of the band, their abilities, relative strengths, experience, musical preferences etcetera. All of these factors can change over time; indeed SHOULD change over time. Hence, aspects of Sep's music have changed also. How sad would it be to say that Sepultura had learnt nothing new in the last 10 years? That their music had been influenced by nothing that has happened to them? Why would anyone want them to keep copying the sound of their earlier work? Would you really want Sepultura to just regurgitate Arise and Chaos AD tracks? Wouldn't that just put them on a par with bands like Status Quo? How utterly tragic that would be.  When playing live, they play a huge number of older songs because they know we want to hear them too. So, if you want older stuff, don't expect it on a new album - go see them live. They're better live than on a disc any day!  Dante XXI is certainly more consistently thrashy than their other post-Cavalera output. (So, if you've been missing that aspect of Sepultura: here it is!) Green's vocals are awesome; there are terrific riffs and fantastic rhythm. It's hard to pick a favourite, but if pressed, I'd recommend you listen to 'Fighting On' - and turn it up VERY LOUD!  With Dante XXI, Sepultura continue to successfully broaden the musical boundaries of both themselves and their fans.  So, set aside your preconceptions and give this album a good listen - you'll love it. "
2,"I have been a fan of Oregon's since they surprised me at the 1974 Newport in New York jazz festival. They walked onto the Avery Fischer Hall stage in saffron gowns, grabbing their tablas, sitars, and other Indian instruments, and all I could say to myself was, ""Oh, THIS won't be jazz."" Their electrifying performance proved otherwise. It was the best set I heard in the entire festival, and Oregon went on to be a progressive force in jazz for many years afterward. However, I found ""Prime"" to be much like the homogenized music that populates the ""smooth jazz"" airways. Though their performances are still of virtuoso quality, the compositions on this CD struck me as formless, generic and unmemorable. I will always appreciate Oregon's body of work, but I cannot recommend this CD as one that is representative of their prodigious gifts"
1,"I am so happy you sent me this e-mail.  I purchased this CD for my brother for Christmas and you sent me the wrong CD - I received something called WHORACLE by IN FLAMES which is not what I ordered and I am really disappointed and I would really like it if you would send me what I ordered, which is the Jimmy Buffett CD - THE ULTIMATE COLLECTION......... Please get back to me.  Thank you, Rosane Cassell"
5,"Of course I remember back when I first heard this song; I was still in high school (yes, the 80's), and it was not from the BHC movie either (I wasn't allowed to see it in theaters). It was at a local club a few years later. This song has not only a KILLER beat that ANYONE can dance to, but KILLER lyrics, singers, and that it was produced by Prince himself - so naturally this song WAS a winner. Still is. It rocks, baby. And I PROUDLY have several copies on CD, cassette AND mp3. A little obsessed perhaps???? Not really. But this literate one-hit-wonder was an indeed dance-club classic, similar to Eddie Murphy's dance hit class one-hit-wonder ""Party all the Time"".  I love singing along to this hit song. And the singers are sharp, focused, and are actually VERY GOOD VOCALISTS. The music flows very smoothly throughout the song, especially the break, where the girl says, ""I don't like this groove....give me something I can CROON to.....catch my drift???""    PEANU"
1,Not nearly up to the standards of their first CD.  Includes too many sophomoric teenage love songs
1,"there is good tune you can dance over and over again ""LET IT WHIP""  by the dazz band. the rest are  funky wild music not for elective taste"
1,"I purchased the Adaptation soundtrack thinking the song from the trailer and the V.W. commercial would be on it. The soundtrack is nothing more than very horrible sounds, nothing from the trailer and very expensive. False advertising at it's best"
2,"Modest Mouse are reported to be living somewhere inside this album.  I, however, cannot find them.  This is the first music they have released that is completely forgettable.  It comes out of the speakers, into your ears and then disappears.  All of the previous MM releases, and I've heard, loved and lived them all, are unique, enduring and beloved pieces of music; this record is not of that ilk.  And that's a real shame, MM are one of the finest bands of the past 10 or 15 years, right up there with the likes of Ween, Built to Spill and all of the Jagjaguwar bands.  Oh well, a rare miss.  I'm still a huge fan, still gonna go see them whenever the tour rolls around (definately go see them live, when Isaac isn't too drunk, the shows can be legendary), still gonna love the freak rock phenomena that is Modest Mouse, just can't seem to get behind this release.     "
4,"I'm not usually a fan of ""power metal"", but this was a pretty good cd all the same.  Some of the songs sound basically the same but there are few that stand out.  Great guitar riff on song 5 The Edge of Paradise. Overall worth buying!"
1,"I hate this music because it is boring, stupid, and downright weak. Let's go over the songs.  1. ""The Tide Is High 0/10 I hate this song! Blondie is the worst group in music history.  2. ""Dancing Queen"" 0/10 I hate Abba to no end!  3. ""I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself"" 0/10 I hate Dusty Springfield until armageddon comes. I hate this album because it does not have any music of the macabre, sinister, and devilish. So if you want music then look somewhere else, otherwise, stay clear of this mess"
4,Of the songs on the CD Heaven Must Be Missing an Angel was the best.  To dance or roller-skate to it was a blast
5,"wilder than louise armstrong of the hot 5's, more adventurous than miles davis in agartha, more rock than the millions and millions of american garage bands since 1960.  i was there.  this is it"
5,"As the review below states, ""The Tokyo Blues"" is one of Horace Silver's best albums.  But with all due respect to Mr. Jones, let's write reviews that tell the people a little bit more about the CD they are thinking about buying.  Recorded in July 1962, six months after a successful and impressionable tour of Japan, ""The Tokyo Blues"" is Silver's way of saying thank you for the generous hospitality he received while on the other side of the Pacific.  Each of the disc's five tunes has a title that refers to an aspect of Japanese culture or tradition.  But don't think Silver went so far as to incorporate Japanese music on this album, for this is classic hard bop from one of the master's of the genre.  The band here is the famous Quintet of 1959-63 (Blue Mitchell on trumpet, Junior Cook on tenor sax, Gene Taylor on bass) with one exception -- John Harris Jr. replaces Roy Brooks on drums, who was ill at the time of this session.  While ""The Tokyo Blues"" may not quite live up to ""Song For My Father,"" it is as good as anything else this quintet cut, including ""Silver's Serenade,"" ""Finger Poppin"" and ""Blowin' The Blues Away."
5,"how do you know when a production in the music business is awsome? because more than 2 years from its release, people still write and talk about it. Progressive House, House, Deep House. This CD is a MUST HAVE for every person who likes music regardless the type of music.  Global Underground 010 - Danny Tenaglia - Athens does represent what electronic music is all about. If i were to pick up a few CDs for another culture (martians) and let them know what ours is about, this would be one of the ones i would pick"
2,"I am a big Brian Setzer fan going back to the Stray Cats. He quite frankly is one of the few artists out there whose music is just fun, lively, and makes you feel ""Hey man, this is music"". Setzer is as talented on the guitar as Jerry Lee Lewis is on the piano and in my mind no better compliment can be paid to a musician.   Every new iteration of Brian Setzer has been enjoyable: Stray cats, to the Swing of the Dirty Boogie, to the Rockabilly of the Comeback Special, and the superb tribute to sun records.  But, he missed it on this CD. The song writing is silly and sophmoric. I do not expect to find the meaning of life hidden behind the lyrics found in Setzer's CDs but the majority of songs on this CD have all the same elements. Some songs are riddled with rhymes children in the first grade use, and are repeated endlessly. Such as in the song ""Bad Bad Girl in a Bad Bad World"".   For example here is a small snippet out of the song mentioned before:   She's a bad bad girl in a bad bad world A bad bad girl in a bad bad world It's not her fault she's a bad bad world It's so sad it's a sad sad world She's a bad bad girl in a bad bad world A bad bad girl in a bad bad world It's not her fault she's a bad bad world She's a bad bad, bad bad, bad bad, bad bad girl  What garbage! By the end of the little chorus you just want to give the CD a toss.  Many of his songs are riddled with the disjointed tempo changes found in punk music. Setzer has been able to do this subtly in the past without calling attention to it, but there are a few songs on here that just sound confused. Definately not a Setzer trait.   There has never been a Setzer song that I absolutely cannot stand, until ""Really Rockabilly"" and ""Bad Bad Girl"". The first two bad songs he has done on the same disc. There is not one single song on here that compares favorably with any other of his songs that have come before.   I have to mention that I hold Setzer to a very high standard, which until now he has never fallen short of. This CD is still far better than 95% of the crap that is being released in today's market.  To summarize I would encourage Setzer to get beyond this CD, and return to his thrown a top the music landscape"
4,"A potentially and stunned melodic death metal album. I'm not considder their best work but this album is their most complete. Incredible melodies, excellent musicianship, stunning guitar riffs. An awesome record by this guys!!"
5,"For many people they only think of Mary Martin or Mitzi Gaynor in ""South Pacific"" so this should be a new and enjoyable experience. I love getting different performers takes on roles that is why I purchase so many different recordings of the same title. This recording sounds remarkable with all the new technology they use to preserve these recordings. It was really great to listen to this because I have heard so much about this limited production so many years ago. I think Florence Henderson is a natural for Nellie Forbush, I think she is a very underrated stage performer and singer.So many people tend to just think of Ms.Henderson as that famous Mrs.Brady role. One shall be quite surprised. Another surprise on this was Giorgio Tozzi his operetic voice brings such depth and masculinity to his role as Emile, it is a perfect match for Ms.Henderson's in their duets. The rest of this cast sounds fine and it is one of Rodgers and Hammerstein's best scores. I think the best things about this recording is that this availability gives people more avenues to enjoy and explore this classic work"
5,"Boyz II Men's Coolhighharmony is 1 of the best CD's i ever bought. I LUV IT!!! first, i was only getting the cd for the hit, ""End of the road"". when i had just got the cd, i listend to the entire thing and soon i wasnt skipping tracks to go to end of the road, i was listening to the whole thing. Every song on this cd is good. its been almost 9 years and i still favor this cd"
5,"Ive listened to ever possible Sinatra era from Dorsey days to the final Reprise days. His voice never seems to falter like most reviewers claim. It would help if I knew when this cd was recorded, but it really doesnt give any information about the dates of the performances. The whole cd proves why Sinatra is one of the greatest entertainers of all time. Ive heard ever live cd by Sinatra and enjoy all of them. I highly recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys good music. Anyone who gives this album less then a four, need to listen to the cd again. Excellent Sinatra concert!"
1,"Wow.  I didn't know music could get this bad. I just didn't.  No words can describe how awful this CD is, but criticizing it is too easy.  Let me list the reasons why you should not buy this travesty of an album (even the word ""album"" is used loosely - at best, this collection resembles a group of theme songs from various C-Grade Telenovela series):  1. THE VOICE :  There is no voice. Granted, JLO was never known for her vocal ability, but having taken vocal lessons and practice from husband Marc Antony, one would think she would sound better, but NO. If anything, Jennifers' weak voice is showcased as being even more weak as she literally whines her way through over an hour of the most godawful caterwauling ever heard this side of the Nanjing Massacre.  2. THE MUSIC :  There is no music. The first single ""Que Hiciste"" has some Spanish sounding instruments thrown in for that ""authentic Mexican experience"" (yeah, right), but from then on out, its one disgusting ballad after the other. There is no melody, and at one point, I was wishing that SOME poor B-side from her ""On the 6"" album would pop up to put me out of my misery. Let it be clear - the music on this is non-existent, and Im not just saying that for effect.  3. THE ACCENT:  JLO is not a genuine native Spanish speaker, but she has definitely worked on her accent. However, its a bit sad when Beyonce's new Spanish version of ""Irreplaceable"" sounds more authentic than anything on this godforsaken CD. Jennifer sounds very forced and gimmicky here, enunciating her Rs and Ts with gusto and a very misplaced conviction. The efforts only lead to what one can call an overwhelming sense of underwhelmingness (the term has come into existence upon the release of this CD)  Jennifer, what went wrong? You had the best producers (though, when you think of it, Marc Antony's only claim to fame in the US is his horrendous ""You Sang to Me"") and enough moolah to pull this off. Inexcusable.  More than that, it proves that the global Spanish revolution that sort of began in the late 90s with the Ricky Martin craze, is definitely over. Jennifer is done with, and when I start respecting her lesser, more vapid counterparts such as Thalia, its a sad day indeed.  True Spanish language albums have CLASS stamped upon them - the only shining example of this is 'Fijacion Oral Vol 1' by our girl Shakira. This album still gives me goosebumps two years past its' release.  'Coma Ama Una Mujer' is a failed effort for all concerned. And if you respect music and your money, you will definitely need to look elsewhere for fulfilment.  Vaya con dios, JL"
5,I picked this cd up after hearing a single freestyle from a mixtape like 2 years before this dropped and knew I had to have it. Im so pleased w/ this album (and all of supas music) that everytime I listen to it I like it a little more. One of those cds you can just pop in and listen till it's over. I just got deadline in the mail today and it's not even in the same league as this album and still better than most cds Ive listened to this year. You can see how he really strives for greatness and is constantly evolving. A true masterpeice and future classic
4,"What a Girl wants is a soundtrack with some cheesy music and some poppy princess music, which inbalances it. The music in the movie well fits the scenes that they're in, but it's just very ""cheesy"" and ""princess poppy"". Some of the music is very upbeat and some of the music changes your attitude as you listen to that song, giving you a mood the song has. But overall, the soundtrack is pretty worth the listen to.   1. Good Life - Leslie Millis 5/5    2. Out Of Place - Gavin Thorpe  3/5  3. Crazy - Meredith Brooks 3/5   4. London Calling - The Clash  3/5  5. Who Invited You - The Donnas 2/5  6. Long Time Coming - Oliver James 1/5   7. Kiss Kiss - Holly Valance 5/5 8. What's Your Flava? - Craig David 5/5    9.

5,I am 31 - but grew up on country music.  I love all music - but especially older country music.  I love Hank senior Johnny Cash etc.  This CD is one of my very best purchases ever.  I have a large music collection.  If you enjoy his music -this is a must buy.  Don't think twice. The best music is a souls essence released in song
2,"If Axiom of Choice have a great talent, it's for getting their music fairly widely known.  But a lot of the music on this cd sounds like an absent-minded jam anyone could have in their garage with a friend.  There's some richer music on this cd, a song or 2, but not really.  For music like this, I recommend other people such as Vas, Rasa, Stellamara, &amp; even Loreena McKennitt"
2,"Why does this cd not appeal to me? Well, it doesn't have what it takes (in my opinion) to reach inside of me and make me tap my foot to the beat. His previous songs did that. Sure, Will is growing and I hope he continues to grow but this cd was a disappointment to me. I expected more. Should you buy this cd? Sure! If you're a fan of Will then go for it. If you want a totally different style of Will then give it a bash. If you're looking for some upbeat music that will make you bop your head at a party or while driving then I suggest you pick another cd"
1,"The Item you sent me was not the right item. I think?  Then you sent me the same item back to me.? Did ask for knowledge on what the difference was on REISSUE and REMASTER. I could have already purchased this item, REISSUE, at the store down the street for less the amount that I spent at Amazon.  Sorry not a satisfied customer"
4,"This soundtrack comes with the .hack//sign vol.4 limited  edition dvd. The soundtrack has great new versions of tons of songs from the anime. If your colledcting .hack, it is a must have."
5,"From all the other reviews, you can pry tell what they sound like so I will just rate the songsw with my opinion  Bombtrack--5/5---Hard rockin with some damn good rappin mixed in  Killing in the Name--5/5---When you listen closely, you can hear the message, put in an amazing rock hit.  Take the power back--5/5---Funky, enjoyable, rockin, what more do you need. Some great riffs in this  Wake Up--4/5---Don't listen to this song very often because you wont want to hear it too much.  Settle for nothing--1/5---terrible, slow with too much goddamn screaming. The one song by this band that I hate  Know you enemy--5/5---funky rock.rap song that is a lot of fun to listen to  Bullet in your head--4/5---Great bass lines, but a little annoying with too much screaming  Wake up--4/5  Fistful of steel--5/5  Township rebellion--3/5--- a little annoying, but fun for a little while  Freedom--5/5---Great album close"
5,"Now this is very good. A CD set with some of the best post-punk material to come out of Liverpool and Manchester. there is unfortunately some great overlap with the Martin Hannett story CD but this set is overall more satisfying since it is more varied and also contains more stuff as well as a few rarities that everybody will appreciate. Indeed, in additioon to Buzzcocks, the Fall and New Order, which were obvious choices there are also some old favourites like Ludus, Crispy Ambulance and Big in Japan that merit to be heard. If you are interested in thie very special period in british music history then this is an essential acquisition."
4,"Ok, well I have to admit that I am as much a fan of the guitar sounds as I am Adam Duritz's voice. I would have rated this as a five star album, yet every once in a while (on maybe two or the songs total) Adam will get caught up in some moment singing and the dud gets kind of whiny. This guy is one of the best singers on the planet, though and this cd is still one of the best that the Counting Crows have ever produced. Okay, well, the guitar sounds are much more raw, very retro and vintage sounding, I wouldn't be suprised if every guitar, amp, and effects pedal are 30+ years old. My favorite songs are definitely Raining in Baltimore (amazing quiet version), Long December, Have You Seen me Lately?, Recovering the Satelites, and Round Here. If you like retro music with strong raw vocals you should love this stuff. I've heard Adam's voice coompared with Rob Thomas of Matchbox 20. Although I would say that they are very unique I admit that for comparison they are simalar in style (Adam's better though). I hope you like the album. Enjoy"
5,"In 1962, it had been three years since Sonny Rollins had released a record.  Frustrated with what he felt was his own limitations, he took sabbatical to work on his form, practicing at the Williamsburg Bridge.  This odd habit led to his comeback album being named ""The Bridge"".  A quartet record featuring guitarist Jim Hall, bassist Bob Cranshaw, and drummer Ben Riley, invariably this album and it's story is the stuff of legends, and deservedly so.  Rollins is on fire throughout-- playing mostly standards (with only two originals), it sounds as if he was itching to get in the studio again, his playing is powerful, focused (""Without a Song""), lyrical (one of the definitive readings of ""God Bless the Child"") and emotive (""Where Are You?"").  Rollins' support is generous and sympathetic, particularly on ""God Bless the Child"", where Cranshaw in particular feels like he's breathing in time with Rollins.  All in all, a worthwhile effort, and an essential point in Rollins' catalog.  It also may be the best place (either this or ""Saxophone Collosus"") to begin exploring Rollins' catalog.  Highly recommended"
2,"Gotta go with the folks who are DBT fans but think they missed a step on this one. Yeah, ""February 14"" and ""Gravity's Gone"" are good tracks, but other than that it's pretty forgettable. I'm especially bummed by Jason Isbell's tunes - what the heck happened? The tracks he wrote for ""Dirty South"" and ""Decoration Day"" were far and away the best songs on amazing records. Now he sounds like a Doobie Brother or something equally silly.   C'mon guys, get it together! "
5,"After churning out psychedelic sludge with Vanilla Fudge, bassist Tim Bogert and drummer Carmine Appice joined the blues-rock gold rush of the early '70s. Entertaining in a Spinal Tap way, Cactus spew fantastic riffs as strutting metalhead Rusty Day plays badass frontman. ""Rockout, Whatever You Feel Like"" is a best song of the ages.best album in years fantastic best as it gets"
2,"""Teach Me Sweetheart"" and ""Waiting To Know You"" get a lot of play around my parts. Likeable, but heavy on the weirdo synth sounds. Ease off the Pro Tools knobs man"
2,Like other reviewers of this CD I bought it because I liked the song Livin La Vida Loca which is played a lot on radio stations and to be honest it's the only song I like on this CD! The other songs just don't appeal to me. He is a good singer though
4,"This is a good collection but I think the previous albums are better. There are a couple of nice tracks but you can feel something missing in most of them. All in all a worthwhile buy if you are a big fan, like me ;"
4,"Dope CD, I liked it, some phat beats and lyrics, everyone does a good job on this CD. Didnt like I couple of songs, but apart from that I loved this"
2,"I was very excited when I finally received this CD because of all of the great reviews. I listened to the first song- it was good. I listen to the third- it was okay. By the time I reached the very end, I realized all of the songs sounded the same except for one.  The music is mostly composed of the traditional rock guitar with a combination of techno sounds. The melodies have been slightly changed, and some have a slower tempo than the originals. I don't mind any of these things. The problem I had was with their lack of a variety of different instruments and styles. All of the songs are semi-hard rock with techno sounds from late 80's music (I can't stand those cheesy saxophone sounds).   I wish they added a few vocalists to the music, used a combination of styles, and not try to fill every second with a barrage of sounds. I suggest you buy a couple songs, but not waste your money on buying the whole CD"
5,"Still haunting and mysterious just as the first two, this would have to be my most favorite out of the Harry Potter installments. Each track on this soundtrack gives you a clear idea of how the movie is like in your head, having the same theme of the last two movies, but making it more eerie and more amusing to listen to it. Having loud tracks, some tracks are beautiful; such as Track 6 and Track 15. I'm very happy that most of the tracks are over 2 minutes long, not having to change the track in like a minute and able to enjoy the melodic score. John Williams is an excellent composer. I highly recommend this to anyone!   1. Lumos! (Hedwig's Theme)  5/5 2. Aunt Marge's Waltz  4/5   3. The Knight Bus   4/5  4. Apparition on the Train  5/5 5. Double Trouble  5/5 6. Buckbeak's Flight  5/5   7. A Window to the Past  5/5  8. The Whomping Willow and the Snowball Fight 5/5  9. Secrets of the Castle  4/5 10. The Portrait Gallery  5/5    11. Hagrid the Professor   5/5  (Sounds Renaissance) 12. Monster Books and Boggarts!  3/5  13. Quidditch, Third Year  4/5 14. Lupin's Transformation and Chasing Scabbers  4/5  15. The Patronus Light  5/5   16. The Werewolf Scene 5/5  (Exciting)  17. Saving Buckbeak  4/5   18. Forward to Time Past  5/5   19. The Dementors Converge  4/5   20. Finale  5/5  21. Mischief Managed!  5/5  Hope you enjoy!   Jordan Overall grade* "
5,"The greatest thing about this LP is the songwriting.  Sexsmith writes songs about overcoming a difficult upbringing, dealing with mortality and being average.  I think he tends to write too many love songs on his other albums but on Other Songs he creates a great diversity and depth.  Mitchell Froom's production is perfect for the songwriting (it's almost as good as Kiko)"
4,"By the way, the 'Tumblin' Tumbleweed' version is by 'Roy Rogers & Sons of the Pioneers', not 'Riders In The Sky"
2,"I don't know what happened with this effort.  I have yet to stop listening to Hellbilly Deluxe and Sinister Urge.  However,I have listened to Educated Horses (through) once, maybe twice. I just cannot make myself listen to it.  And that is really sad because I love Rob Zombie and his music"
1,"Don't believe any positive review of this CD - there is not ONE track that is remotely tolerable music.  This is prime, grade AAA, amateur musical trash ...  if considering this CD, do yourself a favor and just flush the money down the toilet so you can skip the agrevation and the shipping costs. In the past I have given ""CD reviews"" a lot of credence ... NO MORE!!!!  This is foolishness"
1,Ruben Did Not Do This Song Justice. If You Are Going To Cover A Song You Better Do A Better Job Then The Origal. If You What To Hear Flying Without Wings Song Like It Should Be Check Out Westlife
1,"Lets get 1 fact out: IRON MAIDEN DOESNT CARE ANYMORE!!!  How can they be SO brilliant with # of the beast, Piece of Mind & PowerSlave & then put out 5 terrible records in a row starting with X-factor?  This record is soooo boring! I bought it based on Wickerman which I found to be OK, reminiscent of  the old Iron Maiden & then they just ran completely out of material. Track 2 on sounds exactly the same, long boring slow tunes that never end.. going track after track, album after album. Does ""Dream of Mirrors"" ever end? I cant ever tell.. I just lose my attention due to its such a GD drag. Then they hit me with ""Thin Line"" which is even less interesting than the most boring professor I had in the most boring class in my entire college career.   You cant listen to the original ""Iron Maiden"" release & then seriously listen to this new crap & release it, unless you just dont care. Obviously they dont CARE!! This record is TERRIBLE!  If they did care they would relisten to the first 6 or so & rethink thier efforts & either improve the sound or just end Iron Maiden & come out with a new band named ""Too old, too tired!"" & quit defiling the great name of ""IRON MAIDEN"""
1,"unlike other more chill travis discs like ""the man who"" and ""invisible band,"" this cd is really pretty heavy.  I gave the cd away to a buddy of mine who likes hard rock and he loves it.  This is not a cd to put on and relax to"
5,"I'm also 33 years old but my parents actually had the LP of this great album.  (What's a CD?)  However it's been collecting dust for 25 years since it's too worn out to listen to.  Plus, where is that darned old record player anyway!  After recently acquiring this LP on CD, trust me, you'll be glad to hear this fine &quot;tribute to the best&quot; in true 21st century hi-fi sound (CD quality).  Oh yeah, the songs are all good to, but I've loved this album since the '70s. Ahh Haa"
5,"This is by far Modest Mouse's best album. It is hard for most people to understand at first. This album has a whole different feel to it than the rest of their albums. This was the first Modest Mouse album I ever heard, and I couldn't get into it and didn't want to at first. But a friend convinced me to sit through it 3 or 4 times, and now I can't get enough of it. Do yourself a huge favor and buy this album. Close your eyes and listen to it all the way through one or twice, and if you still don't like it, you have poor taste in music and you suck. If you love this album like I do, you'll also love the Ugly Casanova album titled Sharpen Your Teeth. Another great Modest Mouse album is The Fruit That Ate Itself"
1,"basically... kenny wayne is one of the worst excuses for a blues guitarist ive ever seen. i mean sure hes got a little speed but he's pathetic in comparison to pretty much any other guitarist out there! seriously he can't even solo over chord changes! i've heard him compared to the likes over SRV. whoever thinks that is plain deaf. if you want some real hard hittin blues guitar.. go listen to stevie ray, freddie king, albert collins or johnny winter. i feel bad for any music fan who wastes their money on this cd"
2,"I love the other disturbed albums-this one though is somthing of a letdown. with the exeption of ""liberate"" its the same tune from begining to end.   Not great.   I love ten thousand fists though that whole album is teriffic"
2,"I am not sure why this compilation garnered such high scores so far. Maybe because I am into a different brand of dnb, but the tracks on this CD are among the least musical pieces of noise I have heard, with rare exceptions. The beats are rather cliche dnb, which in itself is not too bad. The deep sub-basslines sound great production-wise, but the patterns are often nonsensical.  Generally, if you like very repetitive hard and fast dnb with powerful bass and sinister yet musically simplistic soundscapes, then by all means, get this cd. However, if you expect something fresh, clever, or something that has at least a little bit of musical value, look elsewhere. This is not Roni Size, Aphrodite, or Pendulum. This is dumbed-down Dieselboy"
4,I absolutely love this album!!!  1.) Strong Anything 4/5  2.) No End In Sight 5/5  3.) The Breakup Song 4/5  4.) I Want A Cowboy 5/5  5.) Unbreakable 5/5  6.) Flowers By The Side Of The Road 2/5 ( I don't like songs like this.) 7.) Drop Dead Gorgeous 5/5  8.) Normal 4/5  9.) I Won't Say Goodbye 5/5( My Favorite song on the album)  10.) Home Running Away 4/5  11.) Prelude To The Kiss 4/5  
5,"I loved this Cd by Enrique Iglesias.  I was never a big fan of his until I heard this CD.  The music was so beautiful.  I didn't really know what the songs were about because I do not know much Spanish, but the songs moved me.  Some of them were so beautiful I wanted to cry.  This Cd is well worth the money of buying"
2,"This CD Was uttely boring it sounded like Dianne didn't even care that she was singing. It was a disappointment to me becuase she usually is pretty excting. I felt like she didn't do enough to make this CD perfect. I mean if it was just a regualar person putting out their very first CD, it wouldn't sound like this, becuase it wouldn't sell! Okay so, I have to give it 2 stars becuase at times it sounds relazing and nice, but then I think that every Christmas CD should be as excting as Christmas really is"
5,"What a warm gift.  Thanks Faith!!  This CD was well coordinated and crafted.  The kind of CD you bake cookies, cut greens, make pies, kiss and hug family, kids, while playing. "
1,"I know that this CD set is great, that is why I ordered it. I however got an e-mail after I had already ordered the item that I found on the website saying they refunded my money because the price was wrong and the ""quality of the item wasn't good."" What sort of bad advertising is that? It isn't my fault that they priced it wrong, and if there was a mistake I should have received it anyway. It isn't fair, and I want everyone to know that they obviously did not do their jobs in making sure all of the information was correct to be displayed on the website."
2,"What drugs do I need to take to make this sound good? So many raved about this group so I bought a cd. Big mistake, HUGE. I'm such a sucker"
5,"If someone were to rush up to me and hold a gun to my hand and insist that I recommend one and only one Jesus & Mary Chain album to someone completely unfamiliar with their music with the proviso that it be THE album that would bring that person the most enjoyment, I would be in a complete quandary (though why some insane person would be wielding a pistol in such a nutty undertaking I won't speculate about).  On the one hand, PSYCHOCANDY is unquestionably their masterpiece, not merely a great album, but one of the great precursors of the emergence of alternative music in the nineties.  Yeah, alternative went pop when Nirvana hit it big with NEVERMIND in 1991, but the Jesus & Mary Chain had already copped all the right attitudes and struck all the right chords with PSYCHOCANDY in 1985.  With that album they go down with the Velvet Underground, Television, and Big Star as bands that wield an influence vastly in excess of their collective record sales.    But as great as PSYCHOCANDY is, I'm not sure that 21 SINGLES:  1984-1998 doesn't have better songs.  The collection of singles pulls together not merely the very best songs off PSYCHOCANDY, but a host of great songs off other albums that either weren't as good or weren't very good at all, but nonetheless had a couple of great individual cuts.  For instance, back when I was collecting Jesus & Mary Chain discs, I stopped with PSYCHOCANDY, DARKLANDS, and BARBED WIRE KISSES, two albums and an anthology.  This means that I missed out on some really great cuts that are collected here.  For instance, I was completely blown away by ""Head On"" the first second I heard it, but because I didn't get AUTOMATIC, it was completely new to me.  Same thing is true of ""Blues from a Gun,"" the very scary ""Reverence,"" ""Sometimes Always"" (with guest lead vocal by Hope Sandoval of Mazzy Star), and the wonderful pair of cuts from MUNKI, ""I Love Rock N Roll"" and ""I Hate Rock N Roll.""  These are just great songs, and they really make me regret that I stopped my collecting of their music when I did.    So, I truly hope gun-toting maniacs stay away from me, but if saner, more everyday folk want who are unacquainted with one of the great bands of the eighties and nineties want to dive into their music, I would strongly recommend both PSYCHOCANDY and 21 SINGLES: 1984-1998.  This music is as crucial as anything that arose during the period"
4,"Yea, it's all about the sellout but who cares.  The first song on this album spews acidy alien blood and tears @ss from there.   Paul Leary is quite underrated and Gibby Haynes finally decided to quit being weird without a cause. But they still have a lot of weirdness and that's where some of the filler comes in, but then I never even skip past the German guy.  Bloodlust said everything I needed to say but I'll just back it up- this album is blistering space rock, like Kyuss with the muffler blown off and sped up during the best parts and slowed down at times but all the while complemented by jibberish vocals.   Dust Devil is one of my top 5 favorite songs ever written.  ""Got the power of an upright in his g****m hand! Bahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.  Bahaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"
5,"i haven't finished listening to this cd, it's playing as i type now. much that i've heard lacking in a lot of recordings from the late 70s when mr rollins seemed to be exploring a more popular sound for younger audiences has been recaptured and reshaped, that tone and timbre, his big, full sound, the wonderful improvisation, the sly americana references, the calypso blends, it's all here.  and my best regards to the group, bob cranshaw on bass, steve jordan on drums, bobby broom-guitar, kimati dinizulu-percussionist, and to clifton anderson on trombone, who really knows what it's all about"
4,"Wow! Can you handle derangement recorded on tape? The riffs are tremendous, and the mix is insidious and evil. And then there's Mr. Yow. He's just on another planet"
1,"i have awaited the release of this particular Art of Noise LP onto cd for 20 years. this title was my all-time favorite Art of Noise record. upon opening up the cd & quickly jumping to track 2 - ""Beat Box"" only to find out it has been replaced by the version that appeared on ""Who's Afraid of The Art of Noise"". you can imagine my disappointment! i thought for sure after 20 years i would finally have the original break dance classic of ""Beat Box"" in the digital format. Anyway, being a true Art of Noise fan for many years, this was definately a let down"
2,"To compare this with the Smiths the Furs and the Cure..? is a sacrilege. It is far from those bands, not remotely in their league, and not even close to their sound..  Its lite bouncy uninspired pop. Which is fine, but please be honest with musical comparisons, perhaps listen to the refered bands before using them as a reference"
2,"I was dissapointed when I listened to this cd.  All I wanted was the original version of the Perfect Drug.  This cd only has the remixes.  So if you're buying this cd for the original version, you should just as well buy the soundtrack for the Lost Highway instead"
4,"Loved the movie, really like the CD. It's good music that makes you remember the movie. Perfect addition to a holiday music collection"
5,"You will not be disappointed by this delightful album!  This may be  sacrilege, but the Chieftains can get old after a while (well, they ARE  old)...and Altan is certainly a breath of fresh air.  These folks know what  they're doing, and you can hear it in their whimsical reels.  I look  forward to getting more of their stuff.  Highly recommended"
4,"Very solid release that lacks the radio friendly songs that made Cracker Soul &amp; Kerosene Hat college favorites.  Overall i found the guitar work to be great, same good lyrics and much better vocals from Lowery.  A more creative effort than Gentleman's Blues with less screaming.  I don't know if i agree that this disc has shades of Camper Van Beethoven but this release does remind me more of their first effort Cracker Soul"
5,"It is almost impossible for any album on Amazon to receive nearly a hundred reviews and still get an overall 5 star rating, yet DIFFERENT CLASS has managed to do just that.  Although Pulp has several really good albums, this is their best in my opinion.  It isn't just that the songs are musically compelling; lyrically the songs are frequently and unexpectedly complex.  When this album was first released in England it was one of the rare times when an album achieved simultaneously intense critical and popular acclamation.  Critics declared it a masterpiece, and fans bought it in astonishing numbers.  The album also is deceptively political, in that it features class difference in a large number of songs.    There are many musical highlights on the album, but what I find most remarkable is that there are several songs so good it makes the other songs seem bad in comparison, while one song in particular makes even the other great songs suffer in contrast.  Fans will always differ on their favorites, but few will question that the album starts off strongly with ""Mis-Shapes.""  ""I Spy"" is one of my favorites on the album along with ""Disco 2000,"" which follows it.  ""Sorted for E's and Wizz"" is another stunner.  But seriously, all the songs on the disc are at least good, most are very good, and two or three are great.  But the best of the bunch is unquestionably ""Common People.""  ""Common People"" is simply a great song on multiple levels.  Musically it is incredibly compelling, one of those tunes that once you hear it you can't get it out of your head, with an upbeat tempo that makes you want to get up and dance around.  But this would merely make it a good song; what makes it great is the story the song tells.  An art school student is noticed by a fellow student, a rich girl from Greece, who declares to him that she wants to learn about what it is like to live as one of the common people.  There is a definite sexual come on, as she says that she wants ""to sleep with common people, like you.""  At this point you think you know where the song is going, to a nice if somewhat standard narrative of two people from different classes who have a romance despite it all.  But the song instantly takes you in a different tangent.  What follows is as extraordinary as it is unexpected.  Our hero takes the girl to a supermarket and asks her to imagine being there with no money, a notion she laughs at.  At this point the song turns very serious and dark, as he tears into her for her calloused desire to slum and make a game out of taking on a mode of life that is for others a fairly desperate affair.  He tells her that if she is laying in a bed watching roaches on the wall she can just call her dad and her problems would be over, but to truly find out what it would be like to live like ""common people"" would mean learning what it means to have no choices, no outs, no control.  He sings:  You will never understand How it feels to live your life With no meaning or control  So instead of the song of romance and love that we think we are getting at the beginning, we get an impassioned condemnation of anyone who would make light of the struggles of those who are less well off.  I know of no other song like it.  Pulp has done a number of really fine albums and a host of great songs, but this song has to go down as one of my all time favorites.  It definitely goes onto my all time Top 40.  There are four Pulp albums that I think any serious music fan should own:  HIS 'N' HERS, DIFFERENT CLASS, THIS IS HARDCORE, and WE LOVE LIFE.  If one were bound and determined to own only one Pulp album, one might go with HITS, but this DIFFERENT CLASS is so good that I just can't imagine anyone not wanting this and others as well.  Trust me:  if you don't own this album you need to get it today.  Your ears will thank you"
5,"Say what you want about Bruce ""getting old"", but I strongly believe that this album (which showcases Bruce in his late-40s/early-50s) puts many rockers half-his-age to shame.  All the songs are great, especially the ones that are re-arranged, such as ""The River.""  For a special treat, Bruce throws in the rarity, ""Don't Look Back.""    And yet, of all the songs on this live album, I believe the most impressive is Bruce's acoustic version of ""Born in the U.S.A."", where Bruce plays an acoustic 12-string.  For those of you who have Tracks, but not this, trust me when I say LINYC's version of ""BITUSA"" makes Tracks' acoustic version look like nothing.  ONE WARNING: Though I personally have no qualms about the song-selections, some of you who want to hear the ""staples"" (i.e. ""The Promised Land"") might be dissapointed.  And yet, when it comes to preferences of Bruce-fans, the term ""to each his own"" is definetely applicable.  Is it an extensive treasure-trove of live performances a la Live 1975-1985?  No.  Is it worth it nonetheless?  Yes"
5,I'm listening to NOW 19 right now!!!!!! I love the fact that NOW puts the latest cool songs onto one  GREAT CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! For Christmas I'm getting Now 20!!!!!!
2,"I just recently heard ""Buffalo Stance"" on my local college radio station, and it brought back memories of the first time I heard it in back in the winter of 1989. It isn't difficult to see why this song was so popular back then; it had all the infectious grooves an excellent pop song should have. But there's a problem with the overall album of Raw Like Sushi: all the songs that surround ""Buffalo Stance"" don't even come close to matching its catchiness. Even the inexplicably praised ""Manchild"" is dull.   Find the single for ""Buffalo Stance"" if you can, and pick up a Salt & Pepper album as an alternative to Raw Like Sushi.  "
2,"Although you get alot of songs for $25, you get a lot of garbage which has been typical from MoS in the past two years.  The best songs are from the album that features hits from the past.  You can't really go wrong there.  You'd be better downloading the 10 good songs from iTunes and saving $15"
1,"I didn't buy the CD...I couldn't make it past the samples. I loved Constantine on Idol. I didn't think he was the best there, but I thought he was near the top. Performance wise though, this guy can perform on stage...I just love him. This music though, not impressed. I understand why he would want to promote his original band, but he really needs to give it up and go out on his own. He did so good on Idol and had so many fans. Granted, I'm sure some will buy this CD just because they are a fan. And I'm sure that there are some that will love it. I'm not one of them though. I really wanted to like it, but I just can't. That said though, I would really like to see the Constantine from Idol make his own CD. Now that one I would buy"
1,"CONSTANTINE MAROULIS may be easy on the eyes, but thei s cd is awful.  A bit to hardcore for a debut albumn.  Maybe payback for not getting further in AI, I really think he can sing and does have talent, when he did David Cassidy's I THINK I LOVE YOU, it was a good take on a old 70's song. Then when he did Queens Bohmeian Rhaposdy it sent shivers down my bones, (no Freddy) but not bad. Sorry this is just a disappointment, better luck next cd.  This may have been a let down  to his fans, not to mention that AI  has a large pre teen audience not to mention how many parents would go out and buy this cd, for it surely would have a explicit warning label on it"
2,"2 1/2  Competent though disappointing, this highly referenced trance album cannot escape it's plodding, dated backbone of a beat, no matter how refined and professional the production tries to be. Of course, listening to the album 13 years later, one immediately feels the bland, aged thump soaked into the generic sequencing and tonality, which is not to say the album was not worthy of the praise it garnered upon release-in House-centric circles that is. The thudding, ever present, 4/4 layering of a pulse that guides entirely too much mainstream electronic music out there will vastly undermine any of the dreamy atmosphere heavily present on this ambitious little club-hopper, rendering most of the Yanni-with-edge keyboard melodies banal. Thankfully once in a while, particularly at the start and finish of the disc, a semi-potent spell is afforded these static conditions, allowing Dreamland to shine in refreshingly unrestricted ways"
2,"I own four other albums and all of them are great.  When I pop in a Hootie CD I expect to be relaxed by the soothing voice and the familiar sound that accompany one of my all time favorite bands.  I buy CD's and keep those CD's on the premise that the entire CD is worth keeping.  I am not buying a CD for one or two songs, but the CD as a whole. I just bought this album the other day.  Half of the songs had the familiar feel but the rest could go to waste.  I am giving it a 2.5, because half the album is great. "
1,"Don't buy songs from this racist bastard!!!! And if he so-call ""hates everyone"", why does most of his titles of his b-side songs start with the ""N"" word? Damn hick"
5,"Waterfalls are some of the most primitive things in nature. With this cd, you can't help but think you're right there next to the waterfall. Close your eyes or lie down, and let the natural sounds permeate your mind"
4,Great CD for decorating the house.  It was good to hear some of my favorites singing the holiday songs.  It's very nostalgic
5,"...while we keep hearing the same all tracks every other DJ/Producer is mixing, Sasha comes with a totally different sound that keeps evolving. Can't wait for his next one, awesome."
1,"This item is billed as ""The Best Of "" Shatner and Nimoy..Now I really do have to wonder about the use of the word""Best""here...Neither Shatner nor Spock can sing,so this album exists as a goof...But there really isn't anything funny about the material contained on this disc...indeed,since at the time it was recorded both performers took themselves and thier efforts very seriously,the sides on this album were never intended as joke material..The fact that they HAVE become joke material still does not excuse the fact than any of these sides,by either of these two actors,were ever recorded...Now I like a good joke when I hear one,as well as the next guy,and I appreciate comic tunes,but the dull,tedious,often over-wrought balderdash that is to be found on this album stupefies rather than entertains... Getting back to the use of the word""Best"" as a descrition of what is contained on this album...If this stuff is the""best"" that either man is capable of I can only shudder at the thought of what the stuff left off this compilation must sound like...""Best""...as in The""best""manure the cow has to offer?..As in It's ""Best"" to shoot oneself in the head rather than endure these tunes?Or maybe ""best"" as in IT WOULD BE ""BEST""TO AVOID WASTING YOUR HARD-EARNED MONEY ON THIS FLAPDOODLE....That is a use of the word ""best""that is appropriate...."
2,"That's right, I said it.  I love this album, and yet I still give it two stars.  Let me explain why.    I am rating this album as I would rate any legitimate album.  I do this because I understand that Shatner was being completely serious about this album, and the dramatic interpretations of the two songs/poems/monologues fused together are supposed to symbolize the duality of man, and blah, blah, blah.  I get all of that.  But still, the album is horrendous.  As you listen to it, you cannot help but firmly believe that Shatner thinks he's pulling off some great artistic feat with this album. However, he is wrong.  Horribly wrong.  The arrangement of each ""song"" is sub-par, the backing band of studio musicians on the album has no life, and then there's Shatner himself.  With his trademark delivery, Shatner leaves his indelible mark all over every track, and that's really not such a good thing.  This album would be utterly forgettable, if not for the fact that it is such a train wreck that it is an absolute must-have.  Let me write that again in bold for the folks that may have skipped over this review:  THIS ALBUM WOULD BE UTTERLY FORGETTABLE, IF NOT FOR THE FACT THAT IT IS SUCH A TRAIN WRECK THAT IT IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST-HAVE.   I actually bought this CD as a British import twelve years ago for twenty bucks, long before it was in print on CD in the States, and even now, when I could have bought it for half the price, it is still worth every penny I paid for it all those years ago.  You see, whenever I'm feeling blue, I pop The Shatner into my CD player, and everything gets a little bit better.  It never fails to bring a smile to my face, especially Mr. Tambourine Man and A Very Good Year.    Honestly, this CD is glorious in it's sheer awfulness.  It is so good on such a low level that it has forced me to create a new word to fully describe it: Shatnerrific.  You cannot go wrong buying this CD.  Trust me on this one.  It's my favorite music purchase ever.  No, seriously.  *Ever*.."
1,I would rather buy a plane ticket from him----
2,"I really enjoyed Bear Family's Robert Mitchum two-fer &quot;That Man&quot; and immediately bought this disc when I saw it. First of all, the content is lighter weight than his other albums. These tracks from his early filmwork are great for the Mitchum fan but someone wanting to actually investigate the man's singing ability should be directed to &quot;That Man&quot; or &quot;Calypso Is Like So&quot;. My complaint (and the reason I didn't give it a higher rating) is the packaging. I thought it was beautiful when I first opened it. A shiny gatefold cardboard package with a clear disc tray and a gorgeous book full of movie posters and a complete filmography with lots of great info. Then the tray fell off of the cardboard backing. Then, the pages started falling out of the book! The whole thing literally fell apart on me! For a pricey import disc such as this, it's totally unacceptable. Maybe I just got a defective one, but I'm not willing to plunk down another 22 bucks to find out. If you feel you must buy this disc, a word of caution: handle with care"
1,"I have always been a huge fan of Kris Parker.  I like what KRS has done.  I like what he is doing.  I like the fact that he has never looked to what the masses are putting out and has instead tried from day one to promote positivity.  Therefore, I find that this effort is laudable in its attempt to bring KRS's spirituality to an audience that has been listening to him for decades.  Unfortunately, it falls flat on its face.  The songs on this album do not manage to live up to the message in the lyrics.  KRS is best known for bringing a message to all people by writing about things that could be understood by all people.  That aspect of his work is forgotten on this album, and his work comes across as his preaching instead of his teaching.  It's almost like he's forgotten the experiences that brought about his spirituality, and instead focuses on the goal without paying attention to the trials and tribulations that got him there.  Musically, the beats are mostly just plain terrible, and feel devoid of warmth or personality.  The lyrics feel forced and while his delivery is excellent, the writing is not up to his usual high standard.  Most rappers these days are known for the beats they put together, or the hooks of their songs.  Few are known for true lyrical ability.  KRS has never before fallen victim to this trap.  The reason Criminal Minded, Boom Bap and Necessary did so well was the mix of good writing, excellent delivery and beats that worked with the material presented.  Everyone who listens to hip hop can quote lyrics from those albums (and many, if not most, of KRS's other offerings) - the same can't be said with this album, as he didn't find the right mix to present the material.  Pick up this album if you want a complete KRS ONE collection - otherwise, leave it on the shelf"
2,"Now, I realize after taking a closer listen to this album that this album is not a gospel rap album. On ''Know thy self'', Krs claims that there are many ways to god which is downright not true. Krs claims that any ''God'' that's worshipped will lead you to heaven. Think about that, Allah, Buddah, Jesus, Aphrodite all have nothing to do with each other! Only Jesus deserves to be worshipped! Jesus is the son of god, He did die, And he's the only one that rose again so we could all have a chance to enter heaven regardless of our sin [Which every man and woman has]. As for the cd, I won't lie, It sounds really good and even features a few gospel rappers [T-Bone, B.B. Jay], and Krs even makes significant quotes of actual bible verses, But when it comes down to it, Krs still fails to acknowledge that Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life. This cd gets 2 stars from me for the fact that at least Krs is done dissing Jesus [Something he did on every album after ''Criminal Minded'' and every album before ''The Sneak Attack''] and at least he still ain't afraid to expose the problems of this world, But Krs, If you're reading this, I think you're an extremely talented rapper and you truly need to accept Jesus into your heart. Hope the review helped. Be blessed."
1,"yo for any body that buys,listens or even believes a drop of what he says on this album you are is guilty as he is. Go to [...]and see the real truth. By the way that is not my web site for those that think im trying to get a financial plug and i make no funds or get any love offerings for ditributing this info. May God through ""the real key"" Jesus Christ forgive you and bless you for being so blind"
1,You have Ike Turner and the King of Rhythm as artists for Buddha Bar VIII? If I were to buy this CD? would this be accurate artists?  I would suggest Amazon check their data base
5,"There are a few tracks that stand out on this album.  Pistolero is fantastic with its spicy Latin sound, and Masters of the Universe is good in the typical way.  The deep throaty vocal samples in the track entitled Badimo are very interesting, and carry a unique vibration.  I wonder what it means...   If you like Juno Reactor, this album is worth a look at least"
5,"This is a complete concept album centred around anime and punk classics...  The CD has 13 tracks and clocks in at about 30 minutes this shocked me at first when I put the CD into my pc yet then I realised throughout every minute of the CD it manages to sound fresh no matter how many times you manage to listien to it, this is where the CD'S charm lies in it's bubble gum pop punk rock. It's fun, it's lighthearted it's not serious yet it loves every minute of it ^_^ If you like anime of manga then the packaging will catch you eye immediatly, which is also nice they included the DVD with it so you can see the videos which show off the band's true vision.  If you want some light hearted bubble gum pop punk, or something completly differnt, then you found it. Who thought you could cover the sailor moon theme, sing about captian crunch and cover a punk classic on one album?"
2,"This live album is well recorded, and the band is the best its ever been. Why only 2 stars? The tracklist! Apart from Can I Play With Madnes (yay!) and Lord of the Flies (yawn), its exactly the same as Rock in Rio, released a couple of years ago, with Dance of Death  instead of Brave New World songs.  Why not play Somewhere In Time, or Wasted Years? Or Futureal (ok Blaze song but still)? or Powerslave? All would have fitted into the theme of the concert well. I don't need to see another version of Hallowed Be Thy Name. Or Wrathchild. Or Fear of the Dark. Or Run to the Hills. Good performance (as expected), but VERY disappointing tracklist"
5,"Absolutely a positive influence for our young people!!! I cherish her music, what a wonderful young woman with an amazing voice...whatever she sings!!!  The next best voice of perfection"
5,Now I do not pretend to know everything there is to know about Tears for Fears...but....I LOVE THIS CD! From START TO FINISH! IT is truely a conceptual masterpiece!  I was fortunate enough to see this performed LIVE in Detroit at St. Andrews Music Hall....incredible band incredible musicians...but ROLAND wrote it all!  He is truely a master...and minus CURT too he is still as good as ever! ITS A DARN SHAME that this did not get airplay and the concert only showed up as a small tiny ad in the corner of the local jam rag...but THE SHOW WAS INCREDIBLE the ALBUM has given to many a spin in my car CD player...it was in rotation there for about an entire year and often times repeated!  References to LENNON and MCCARTNEY are made and i think they are RIGHT ON CUE!  Roland is a true pop genius!  WHO CAN REALLY ROCK OUT TOO! Who ever said POP SONGS had to be boring eh? Just see this band perform one time if you are lucky enough!  Somewhere i see he appologized to Radiohead for playing the song CREEP but i saw him perform it with complete perfection!  The stage was extended with speakers galore and sound equipment to fill a HUGE VENUE in a small tiny club!  The lights and music and show were incredible and this cd is a GREAT one to own! CONCEPTUAL and PERFECTION in a POP RECORD!  GIVE THIS BAND MORE CREDIT!  THE poor website for this album set desolate for more than several years no activity!   Shame ITS A LOW DOWN DIRTY CRYING SHAME .....music has no support for the fine artists such as Tears For Fears...however ROLAND and CURT you have my FOREVER SUPPORT You are BOTH TRUE GENIUS's
5,"Where should I start, Well it was 1997 when my older cousin said let me show you a game. It was of course FFVII, I was BLOWN AWAY by the game. At the time I was 7 years old. I immediatly bought the game and played it straight through.   I always loved the music, it was one of the many fine elements of the game. Nobuo Uematsu did an amazing job with the music he is truly an amazing person, If I saw him walking down the street I would bow before him and kiss his shoes (I bet I'm not the only one who would do that).  Here I am now 15 years old just listened through all 4 (YES FOUR!!!) CD's (which I put on my iPOD. I was blown away, with each song I remember exactly what took place in the game and where I was and what I was doing.   Any fan of FF would love this but even people who never played the series would appreciate it, but if you have played the game straight through you can get the full effect of it.  The price you say may be high but lets do a little math here. All four CD's cost $29.18 now there are 85 songs. Divide and each song will cost about 34 cents, yes 34 cents. You buy songs on iTUNES for 99 cents. It's a great deal, I would pay $100 for this.  If you played FFVII BUY IT!!!!!!!!!If you havn't played FFVII buy the game, it's the best game ever screw Halo 2"
5,"Forget about the pop music of Loggins and Messina. This album is different. This happens to be the best Jazz/Country fusion album ever done. There's great musicianship here. There's EXCELLENT instrumental solos that can take up half of the track as in ""Move On"". This is superb music that never made it to the radio. These tracks are simply too long to have gotten air play back in the 1970s. L&M put together a truly great album with Mother Lode but not too many people have heard it. Sadly, they broke up shortly after this album was released. Afterwards, Kenny made a come-back by going strictly pop."
5,"I have always been quite a hard core Indie fan. I cam across my first Otis Redding song 'Try a Little Tenderness' when I was watching the 80s Teen Flick, Pretty In Pink. It struck me as being one of the most emotional, moving and captivating song I had heard in a long time. It caught my emotions exactly at that moment and now remains a song that is very precious to me. I would like to say thank you to Otis Redding for opening my eyes to different varieties of amazing music, and for creating this incredible album. As someone said before, it is a shame we lost him at such a young age as he had such a unique talent, but i am thankful his music remains to keep his memory forever"
5,"I have been an Offspring fan for many years.  I have listened to every one of their albums serveral times over and this one has came out on top of all of the rest.  In my opinion, the albums from greatest to least are (not counting their greatest hits album):  1. Ignition 2. Self Titled 3. Smash 4. Ixnay on The Hombre 5. Americana 6. Splinter 7. Conspiracy of One  Note that I am judging the album as a whole, and not just by the best songs.  Ignition has not a single ""space filler"" song.  It is a raw, 90's punk rock, consistant album.  Some disagree that this is the best of the bunch and argue that Smash is.  I agree Smash has amazing songs like ""Self-Esteem"", ""Come Out and Play"", ""Gone Away"", and many others that helped boost the Offspring to the mainstream.  But not every song on Smash is absolutely good.  ""Dirty Magic"" is the best song on the CD, if not the best Offspring song of all time.  I think it is overlooked and underrated.  Ignition starts off with Dexter yelling ""F**k"" and shows you were the album goes from then on.  ""Session"" is the first song on the CD and one of the top songs of the CD.  There are many great and catchy songs from then on.  Then hits the more emotional, dark, and mysterious song ""Dirty Magic"".  Then it moves into the drug song on the album which is ""Hypodermic"".  After that comes the pyromaniac loving song, ""Burn it Up"".  ""No Hero"" is also a great example of how the Offsping can turn a simple chug riff into something amazing.  ""L.A.P.D."" is to Offsping like ""F**k The Police"" is to N.W.A.  Another catchy song comes after that called ""Nothing From Something"".  And what better way to end the CD with a great song like ""Forever And A Day"".  Sure this album is no Sgt. Pepper's, but no one has touched The Beatles.  So I highly reccomend this album to people who have heard the Offspring before.  But if you are just starting to enter the Offspring's world, I would suggest Smash for a better feel.  After you get Ignition and if you really like it, their self titled is right up there with it"
1,"I used to like these guys, but the more songs I hear by Minor Threat and TSOL, the more I realize how the Offspring were just copycats.  What a discrace to punk.  I wish bands like the Offspring, Good Charlotte, Green Day, Blink 182, Simple Plan, and New F@g glory would just (...) off!  The only ""American Idiots"" are the ones that buy into this boy band poser punk.  ""WE'RE JUST A MINOR THREAT!"
5,"I had this record when I was little so when I saw it out on cd I had to buy it for my kids.  We loved it this holiday season.  It took me way back in time and was just as much fun now as it was then.  All Christmas, every time we got in the car my kids wanted to hear it.  If you like Christmas, you will like this cd."
1,"The title of that song is ""Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)"" by Baz Luhrmann. It is sometimes also called ""The Graduation Song."" Thought I'd help you all out"
1,The only song I liked off the soundtrack was The Royal Crown song the rest were kind of bland
5,"It's a thrill when a veteran musician puts it all together and every track is a keeper.  Jimmy Smith plays to his strengths (great organ riffs) and gets help from a lot of equally talented friends.  GREAT vocals on this album, sax and guitar.  A real pleasure, among my top jazz albums.  If you you're a long time jazz fan or looking to buy your first jazz album, Jimmy Smith DotCom Blues ought to be on the top of your want list"
5,"I'm no longer as ignorant about public policy and processes and the government as I was when I started listening to the likes of ""Suffer"" and ""Against the Grain"". Now I don't protest things or show support by voicing my opinions for all to hear or through public action like a pretentious prick, but now I do it by voting and posting crappy reviews. And I don't totally agree with Bad Religion like I used to, but, I gotta hand it to them, they definitely  churned out another great album and I love the songs. ""Beyond Electric Dreams"", ""Los Angeles is Burning"", ""Sinister Rouge"", ""God's Love"" are all great. I say, you don't have to support the band view on the current issues and whatnot, but show the love for the band and their musical talent"
5,"Larson's last two efforts (Watercolor Sky, Sepia) were both outstanding, polished albums with Hank Linderman at the helm.  This album is more ""raw"" and stripped down in style.  More of Jeff's contemporary edge comes through on Two Part Confessional, as if Linderman is giving him more production input in the final mixes.  ""Looking at December"" has more of a solo acoustic singer-songwriter sound than we heard before.  ""Maybe Cascade Idaho"" fully has that Beach Boys/Brian Wilson sound Jeffery Foskett brings to the table and as such, more of a Foskett than Linderman sound. ""A Better Day"" sounds more like an America song than Gerry Beckley has done in decades, and since he co-wrote and sang strong backing vocals, it really bears his presence well. ""The Way Outside"" recalls 1973 Eagles/Walsh/Fogelberg ballads, which Linderman has successfully duplicated with his production style. ""Play Through"" has a AAA radio sound to it, with expressive acoustic guitars and simple tight e.guitar, drums & bass.  ""Only Green"" is a beautiful ballad (i.e. Souveniers), and the electic guitar production is remeniscent of Bruce Gaitsch (Richard Marx, Timothy Schmit) on some of his solo work.  A surprise addition comes after the end, as a short instrumental ensues, no doubt the type of thing that usually winds up on the cutting room floor.  All in all a very satisfying group of songs, not a bad one in the lot, which I find amazing in today's music. "
1,"After the nu-metal ship sunk, Dez got rid of Coal Chamber (another terrible band) and started this awful band to keep the paychecks flowing.  In doing this, he's making us think he's a death/black metal fan, but I know that he's nothing more than a run-of-the-mill trend-hopper.  Now to the music, it's lame, watered-down ""metal"" made for the kids who listen to Trivium, Slipknot, and Korn.  Listen to Kreator's ""Enemy of God"" for a WAY better metal album from 2005"
5,"DevilDriver really improved with the release of their dynamic sophomore album ""The Fury of our Maker's Hand"". This CD is excellent. The guitar riffs are amazing, and Dez Fafara is definitely unique with his vocals. The tracks vary in speed, whether it's the up-tempo of ""Hold Back The Day"" or ""Driving Down the Darkness"", or the doomy ""Sin and Sacrifice"". ""Grinf**ked"" is definitely the standout track and a definite anthem. Recommended if you like it heavy.  P.S. This isn't ""brutal death metal"". Brutal death metal is stuff like Devourment, Saprogenic, Gorgasm, etc. Just so that you know."
2,"If you have never heard Mecano before, DO NOT BUY THIS ONE. The new songs are garbage at best. And even as a greatest hits collection, this fails. Buy all of the albums except this one. The best albums to buy for a new listener are &quot;entre el cielo y suelo&quot; and &quot;descanso dominical&quot;. This features 7 new tracks, 1 remake, and 22 of the classics (but they left off several of their all time greatest like &quot;cuervas de esa chica&quot; y &quot;laika&quot; y &quot; el cine&quot;). I give it 2 stars because I have so much respect for the work they've done in the past. But this was a really lame production"
1,"Steve Perry came thru good, but the instrumentation was lousy, and this is remastered! Pfoohey! My vynyl is better. I want my money back. Don't think I'll buy Legacy products again"
1,"These guys haven't put a good album out since Floored.  Lemonade and Brownies is a great metal album and by far their best.  Once &quot;Fly&quot; was a hit, it ruined their sound and they completely sold their souls and sold out their old fans.  When I heard the first single off this album, I almost cried to see how low this band has gone.  I can't believe Mark McGrath was in that Angel's Song for Sevendust.  Now there's a metal band that still puts out good hard albums"
1,"A missed opportunity by Bruce Springsteen to produce Live Box-Set Two. Unlike ""Live 1975 to 1985"", he could of balanced the ledger from his first live project with a much better selection from the final ten shows at Madison Square Garden 2000. At this stage in his career it would not be important to master a selection of live takes from different dates and venues. Instead, a vast repertoire of his music was performed at this one venue, according to the set lists of these ten shows. If Bruce saw this and implemented it, this could have set the record straight with his fans and the bootleggers. A fan's dream I suppose. Otherwise a poor live CD capitalizing on the margin of time it took to release the much better DVD product. It is obvious that some of the most important live songs were included as an afterthought.  I have no problem with Bruce's politics but I am disappointed with the quality of his recent releases on CD. In the end, this is what matters most to me as a fan of the Boss.      "
5,This cd is incredible.  I love their style and the vocals are superb! I will continue to purchase more of their music.
4,"When this CD came out, I ordered it immediately, without watching the movie first. Since I live in Holland and the movie wasn't out here yet. I'm a huge fan of John Powell's scores and I'm glad (again) I bought this score.   The score sounds a little bit like 'The Italian Job' with a spanish flavour to it, because of the percussion and the accoustic guitars. Although the tracks are new and refreshing, I found out that small pieces of music in the film are not on the cd. Like: the 'house fight' part with al the percussion instruments. It's on the cd ('Kiss and Make Up - I believe), and it's a brilliant piece of percussion, but it's not the same as in the movie (that sounded better to me).   Second: the cd is a little on the short side. The total play length of the soundtrack is only 44 minutes. A lot of tracks (20) all relatively short, but... different. So you'll get a lot of different tracks swinged at your ears without to much repeating melody's. Something to get used to after listening to the more monotone Bourne Identity soundtrack.  Nevertheless a brilliant soundtrack, a must have for the John Powell score fans!  (sorry for the dutch-english) grtz, from Holland"
5,"Make It Big is one of the two WHAM! albums with the other being Music From the Edge of Heaven. Of all the three albums released by WHAM!, Make It Big is the better one of the three. With three number one hits including ""Careless Whisper"", Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go"" and ""Everything She Wants"". Another song that made the top 5 is ""Freedom"" ranking at #3. All of the songs on the album r my favorites so i don't have a clear cut favorite. Everyone else haz said wut i wanted to say so there's no use in repeating it except thta i HIGHLY EMPHASIZE that if u r an 80s music lover or love to listen to pop in particular, then u MUST get this album"
2,"PRODUCTION SUCKS THE LIFE OUTTA THIS RELEASE. GIVES ME A HEADACHE. WHINING, WHINING...THE VOCALS ARE REAL PATHETIC. SAVE YOUR MONEY"
1,"See above for reviews that pinpoint some of the problems with this album.  Production quality (or uniquely bad production choices), lack of musical enthusiasm, appalling lack of catchy tunes or lyrics from a band I thought had true capabiities --pick the flaw that bugs you the most.  Any way you slice it this album is a stinker.  Better luck next time CYHSY.  (Your first album was gold.)  Consumers: make sure to listen to those samples before you buy this one.  If you are looking for more great songs like the ones on their first effort then this isn't it.  I'm convinced that the band knew what they had made this time around and that the title, ""Some Loud Thunder,"" must be a witty, veiled reference to flatulence.   "
5,This is a very good collection I stumbled across and has the original (and pretty much best) versions of all the hits - and I disagree with the last reviewer who cited &quot;Chega de Saudade&quot; as being bad without the  lyrics - it's one of my favorites and is such a perfect tune that it needs  no lyrics!  Get this album if you are even slightly interested in Bossa  Nova - it has quickly become one of my staples..
1,"I liked very much the film Black Orpheus, but when I bought this record I hoped to listen the music, not the movie. Most of the tracks has sounds of the movie overimposed to the songs, as would be heard in the movie. Then why not buying the movie? When I listen a cd I care about music, that is contaminated in this record.  And doesn't help neither that songs are changed abruptly frequently. Besides, the art of the cover is very poor, dishonors the movie, and the written comments claim that the sounds of the movie are a plus, recalling the scenes of the movie were the sounds appear, improperly: the ""Oh No!"" sound of ""Frevo"" that is commented does not apear in the movie as said.  As a summary, Verve did wonderfull editions of jazz, but this edition falls far behind the standards of both Verve and the film; clearly, Brazilian music doesn't seems to be Verve territory judging buy this edition"
5,"this warts and all is much better than warts and all volume one..the highlights include a 25 minute version of Kids, a very good timmy tucker and some other extended jams which were good as hel"
5,"If you are tired of the usual guitar playing, with all its already extremely used ways, but don't want to give up listening rock'n'roll, you really should get this album. Not only a guitar player, but also a  songwriter growing after each work, he can give you rock at the best level,  and at the same time showing something new, that will not sound strange to  your years. That's a difficult task you have to admit. And if you think  that this is all, you should get his last online album &quot; Ulysses  (della notte)&quot; even better than this"
1,this was the worst music that sounded like david bowie.  i can't believe these guys have even gotten a record deal....oh the humanit
2,"Daz Nigga Daz & Kurupt the Kingpin are clearly gone. When you hear quality material like ""Dogg Food"" and then switch to this ""Saga"" CD... One has to wonder where the effort went?  It's always a treat to see Daz and Kurupt together doing stuff. They've accomplished a bit on solo projects and dualing on other albums. But this one was a rush-to-the-studio. Daz- has he changed this much? His talent levels have kept him bringing stylish beats in the past- very jazzy, funky with many instruments felt. That's all gone now..... Now it's bass, bass, bass with lost chorus direction and no style.  Daz's delivery isn't even what it use to be. The pitch is very high all the time, even if the production doesn't call for it. Kurupt back in the studio on this one is nice. But we get a lost focus with so many destractions. And what's clearly missing is the other lineups- no Soopafly, Snoop, Nate, Mr. Malik, Bad Azz... so forth. I know, I know that DPGC album is coming out to reveal that all. Well Daz & Kurupt should've waited instead of damaging their album archive.  Album had a couple of nice ones. Overall, not at the level of their capability.."
5,"I guess ""Bible of Dreams"", Juno Reactor's bold foray into territory beyond their techno days, contains the best sounds. Aw, who am I kidding? It's the greatest album in the history of the universe!!!  1) Jardin de Cecile - 4/5. You might call it boring; I call it moody. This is not the standard ""calm & slow"" sound of Juno Reactor--in other words, it's not a droning, monotonous pile of neverending bull. This one actually has character, which is maybe not as evident in the first couple of minutes as it is later. We get some atmospheric, echoing notes that have a nice, dreamy quality to them. After a while, percussion joins in, along with this weird ""sweeping"" noise that pops in every few seconds. About five minutes in, the song undergoes a complete change of style and transforms to heavy percussion and a little synth. A nice intro that gives you a taste of things to come. It's like the POV of someone gradually waking up and joining the traffic jam of everyday life. While stoned.  2) Conga Fury - 4/5. You may have heard this in ""The Animatrix"" or ""Mortal Kombat: Annihilation"" (so sorry for mentioning that movie). It starts off with a lone female voice whose harmonizing is soon joined by jungle drums and synth. It continues on with the drums and the synth and the voice until it quiets down and ends the same way it began. And what's really funny is the male voice that kicks in at two minutes. It's somewhat weird and out of place, but it's so hilarious that I can forgive Watkins. ""Huela! Huela! Libalalibalalibalalibala..."" Or whatever he's saying.  3) God is God - 5/5. It's funny. When I first heard ""Pistolero"", I thought that no other Juno Reactor song could ever be as good or better. Kids today, eh? Whatever melancholy quietude existed in the first two songs is completely gone here. We've left the jungle and entered the desert, and does it deliver. Don't be fooled by the spacy sound at the beginning--that soon gives way to a crazy beat with chanting and all the instruments you'd expect in the Middle Eastern culture. There are also sound clips apparently taken from ""The Ten Commandments"", which are weird at first and then as cool as the rest of the song. Sure, it's repetitive, but the main tune is WAY awesome, and as long as we have that...repetition matters not, grasshopper.  4) Komit - 4/5. Not bad at all. A remix of this was heard early on in ""The Matrix Reloaded"", and I must admit, I liked it better there. It begins with a series of notes that give one a sense of flying through the calm night air. I would've liked to hear these notes become more prominent, but alas, only in ""Reloaded"". Here, they stay in the background and let the Juno percussion take over. The song just gets bizarre at times, although the grungy tunes are worth it. That's about all. Overall, this is a more organic version of something you'd hear in ""Transmissions"".  5) Swamp Thing - 4/5. Ah, looks like they're tackling heavy metal. This starts off grungy and gritty, and doesn't let up until it's over. The usual percussion kicks in, and sticks with a sinister tempo for a while. When we hear the guitar solos at approximately 3:30, it seems kinda belated and anticlimactic, especially since they don't go much further than that; we slip right back to the percussion. I'm only giving this a 4 because it's rather catchy.  6) Kaguya Hime - 5/5. This can be compared to ""Swamp Thing"", but it takes itself a lot less seriously. It's got a similar setup and form: percussion accompanied by minimal synth. About forty seconds in, we're introduced to a very playful beat that sounds like the work of hollow drums played by chopsticks. Or something like that. Midway through, the drums ""mature"" into a heavier-sounding variety, with some more synth playing alongside than before. It's still playful, though. In fact, this is a very fun song to listen to if you don't mind a drum being the primary instrument. Reminds me of the final segment of ""Jardin"". I'm only giving this a 5 because it's supremely catchy.  7) Children of the Night - 5/5. And now for something completely different. While the previous six have different styles, one can tell that they're all Juno Reactor works. With this, it might be a little more difficult. At least for me. On the platter is a tune that sounds evil yet fun. Shall we say...giddy. It's very, very giddy. You can imagine an evil force approaching to kill you, but messing with your mind first by sneaking up on you from multiple directions, or filling your mind with images from your worst nightmares. It is giddy. There's not a lot of ways to describe it. Giddiness all around. ""The children of the night are call-eeng...hehehehe...hehehehe..."" accompanied by the sound of puppies allegedly whimpering before their horrible, gas-filled deaths. Brrr. Did I mention it's giddy?  8) Shark - 4/5. I know, I know, it's ""calm & slow"". But it's also not monotonous. If you haven't figured out from the title, this conveys an underwater feeling to the listener. It's very mellow and trancy, and in some parts, definitely reminiscent of Vangelis' opening score for ""Blade Runner"". It's down-time for the entire song, although there is a rough patch that's supposed to resemble a tectonic plate breaking apart or something. Ruins the calmness, I think. The length is another problem; it's over nine-and-a-half minutes long. When a song doesn't have a lot of musical variety, you might wanna shorten it. On the plus side, featured here are a bunch of trippy sound effects that sound underwater-ish, but I don't really know why. Without these sounds, this song is what you'd hear at one of those big aquarium display shows. With the sounds, it's...well...Juno Reactor at its calm & slow finest.  9) High Energy Protons (Orion Mix) - 5/5. I'm fully aware it's a remix. I'm fully suspicious of the guys for being lazy. But that doesn't stop the ""Bible"" finale from ruling. To make it easier for you, I'll just assume that you've already listened to the original version in ""Transmissions"". And by ""easier for you"", I mean ""easier for myself"". Some of the techno sound is still here, but the background choir holds much more presence. Furthermore, there's the addition of a few synth riffs that add another dimension to the whole thing. However, I still like the original mix better. Don't ask why. And if you're wondering about the dialogue clips, they've dropped ""You're going to have a wonderful trip."" All we've got here is ""You're the brain and central nervous system"", ""High energy protons spilling over into our atmosphere"", and ""Everything's going extremely well."" (YES! HAL-9000!!!"
4,"Well, somehow I picked up the Rev's first-ever Christmas album even before the two Brians' 2005 holiday discs (the sainted Wilson and the slick Setzer, that is). As Santa said of Rudolph's first jump at the Reindeer Games in that classic Rankin-Bass ""Rudolph"" special, not bad! Not baaaad! There are a lot of cool and interesting goodies in this Christmas stocking, enough to please most of the Whos at your local Whoville. The disc has a chunk of Chuck Berry, and not just the album-closing ""Run Rudolph Run"" (with the Rev, aka guitarist Jim Heath, trading instruments with his bassist, Jimbo Wallace). It actually starts with track 1, the full-tilt boogie-woogie version of ""Frosty the Snowman."" The credits don't list the pianist, but ""Winter Wonderland"" also has a lot of that Berry/Johnnie Johnson interplay, straight out of ""You Never Can Tell."" There's also a bit of blazing Berry/Johnson boogie-woogie sharing space in the unlikeliest of places: alongside a mad-mod-surf ""Batman"" swirl on ""Santa Claus Is Coming to Town."" Other yummy flavors in the Rev's holiday petit fours assortment include a slap-bass rockabilly hoedown instrumental of ""Jingle Bells,"" a Ray Charles-type gospel-meets-country-ballad version of ""Silver Bells,"" a snarky, dirty, bottom-heavy, finger-popping rockabilly swing through ""Rudolph,"" a hoedown of ""Santa on the Roof,"" and an instrumental of ""What Child Is This"" that tosses around country, surf, spaghetti western, even a little bit of Traffic and Hendrix. That's to go along with faithful versions of Elvis' ""Santa Bring My Baby Back"" and Buck Owens' ""Santa Looked a Lot Like Daddy."" The only soft spot is Heath's voice. The Rev's rasp is well suited for his patented rockaswingapunkabilly raveups, but certainly not smooth enough for the likes of ""Silver Bells"" and ""Pretty Paper,"" or even ""Santa Bring My Baby Back."" But hey -- you know what? This album is such a high-spirited affair, and the Rev, Jimbo and Scott Churilla, the drummer, have been such good boys this year, that Santa can overlook that shortcoming. They should find a little something extra under their trees for spreading such cheer"
5,"This album has become surprisingly influential.  It was the first album to feature celebrities singing badly.  I remember the first time I heard it; I laughed my head off.  It spawned three sequels and several imitations.  Hey, it even helped revive William Shatner's career!  Of course, Shatner's unforgetable renditions of &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot; and &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; are the highlights here, but there's much more.  Shatner's first mate, Leonard Nimoy, who was the most prolific actor/vocalist (five albums!), has two amazing contributions here.  Everybody's favorite butler, Sebastian Cabot, has two songs from his spoken word album where he overacts Bob Dylan lyrics.  Speaking of overacting Bob Dylan songs, you should here what Eddie &quot;Green Acres&quot; Albert does to &quot;Blowin' in the Wind&quot;.  Jack Webb recites &quot;Try a Little Tenderness&quot; in his best Joe Friday monotone.  I could go on and on, but I will get to the point and say that &quot;this album is hilarious&quot;.  I highly recommend this album to anyone who likes funny music"
1,Two CDs that would fit on one and at a double price. Get another collection
5,"Holy Toledo!  What a mix of unbelievable sounds. From the most haunting melodies to the rockinest guitars ever heard with sounds inbetween you've never imagined.  It's unnerving and riveting and shocking and there's a crazy edge to it that kind of stuns the senses because they can't be sure they're really hearing what they've just heard.  Highly addictive.  Highly unusual but an absolute must have listening experience.  ""Baby's on Fire"" and ""Cindy tells me"" are worth the price by themselves.      I can't live without cranking this thing up two or three times a month and listening to it 2-3 times straight.      I'm going to shut up now because I have to go listen to it again.  All the cudos from other reviewers here are dead on.  This is one amazing album that I will be drawn to 30 years from now and I've had the vinyl since '74.  The CD is perfection. This is an underground classic"
1,"I purchashed this CD remix single thinking it was a medley of the original songs, but it turns out it is just Prince remaking his old hits and blending them together.  It's a little deceitful that it doesn't say on the CD that these are re-recorded versions.  Very disappointing"
2,"I've tried to make it through the album twice and I'm bored to tears with these songs. Maybe it will sound better on a cold rainy day. I so wanted to enjoy this album, but can't seem to get into the versions of these songs. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone but a die-hard fan."
1,The problem with this CD is their is another CD called &quot;The Singles&quot; which contains all these songs and more. The only song left out is &quot;Wind Beneath My Wings.&quot; True Sheena's version is far  superior to Bette Midler's it is better to buy the CD &quot;Machinery&quot;  from where the song was pulled
5,"If you buy this CD, listen to ""Riff Raff"" on 10, and your not convinced of the absolute transcendent beauty of the dirty-band-of-demons that was AC/DC at this time in history, you must be dead.  Although it's quite short and doesn't have the songs you might expect to see, this is an absolutely crucial document of the quintessential bad boys in their prime"
2,"I just got this at a bargain price from Amazon.co.uk. Its great for completists and Meek collectors, and even for those who want to know about girl singers or production methods of the 1960s. But it's not very listenable. There are about four really good tracks on it, and no stars with the possible exception of Glenda Collins"
5,"I got this cd almost exactly a year after hearing &quot;Not Pretty Enough&quot; on a sampler cd I got from purchasing a present for someone. I immediatly fell in love with the song, mainly because it put my feelings into words about someone. After listening to the one song for a year, my boyfriend finally got me Barricades and Brickwalls for christmas. It's awesome, and I'm listening to it now! Her voice is amazing, with a touch of breathiness that adds to the overall effect. The lyrics are another thing, so thoughtfully written out and sung from her own heart. She actually wrote the songs herself. I've never been a country fan, but the cd is making me change my view (very slowly!). I love this girl"
5,"There's a difference between an o.k. album and a good one, All Mod Cons is neither, All Mods Con is a masterpeice. it has a level of quality that few albums have, great songs, great production, and great fade ins and fade outs, no this is not just a collection of songs all laced together in any random order.  A very well thought out sequence has the album's lone cover The 60's-ish psychedelic/mod/pop sound that is David Watts (a Kinks song) followed, by &quot;English Rose&quot;'s acoustic guitar and ocean waves, And when the singing kicks in, and thats when it hits you how good this album really is.  &quot;In the crowd&quot;'s bass lines, guitar riffs, and melodies, is one of the many gentle gems in the album.  And then just when you think you're listening to a 60's pop album, &quot;Billy Hunt&quot;'s Guitar intro punches in, reminding you, The Jam were many things, including a great Punk Band.  Well I guess i should end there, thats Tracks 4-7. but I should mention my favorite tracks right now are (2) &quot;To be someone (didn't we have a nice time)&quot; and (8) &quot;It's too Bad&quot; but honestly the whole album is a pleasure to hear from the &quot;1,2,3,4&quot; Whisper/intro to the haunting closer &quot;Down in the the Tube Station at Midnight.&quot; Albums just don't get better than this one, folks"
2,"The music in this CD is beautiful, the lyrics are lovely as well. The fact that I don't like Michael Crawfords' voice might have something to do with this...Gerard Butler was the first Phantom I heard.... so I hold my standards to him. Michael Crawfords' voice is nice, I'll admit, but give me Gerry any day. Perhaps Michael DID have a voice suited for the role, and perhaps Gerard Butler didn't, but I'm partial to emotional songs to wooden-flat ones, and baritone voices to tenor voices. Sarah has a lovely voice, but in my opinion, it is a bit too mature for the part of a 16 year old girl.  But don't let this stop you-buy this CD...you may love it, you may hate it. Just compare Michael's voice to Gerard's voice...the difference is rather laughable"
5,"THIS ALBUM KICKS A*S, if you can't handle Angus Young in your face with amazing guitar solos then your p*ssy a*s needs too find music like Garth Brooks S*IT!"
5,"Wow / Grape Jam is incomplete. So is Columbia Legacy's Vintage. Answer....Buy both albums (Amazon's other buying options still has some copies of Vintage for around $15/disc - which in California is a third of a fill up for a camery).Take the best cuts of both, and put them on a blank disc (the only song you wont have is the (very spacy) the Lake, and the announcement to turn your platter speed from 33 1/3 to 78 for Just Like Gene Autry, a foxtrot that was on the original WOW album.  This album reminds me a lot of Buffalo Springfield Again. Pungiant little gems from a rapidly disintegrating band.  Enjoy.  Incidentally, you can do this, add The Place And The Time (original version - from Vintage), Miller's Blues (Live - from Vintage), and still have around 7 minutes to mess around with. Great for a car backup"
2,Nice listening and partying music from a seemingly low-brow but funny and wise movie
1,"Completely disappointed. No soul, no tradition. Save your money unless you're into UB40 and synthesized reggae...ugh. It is all to obvious why there are no samples of this CD on the web page. I took one for the team...buyer beware. SUPPORT LOCAL MUSIC"
5,"This is one of my top 10 CDs of all time. Check out my other reviews and you'll probably be surprised. But this CD left a lasting impression on me when i was like 16 or so. It has some of the most well-crafted SY songs in my opinion and some of the sweetest, sublime, fuzzed out guitar sounds ever.  Track 1 is the perfect song. Track 2 (Junkie's Promise) rocks harder than anything they've ever done. They played it on Conan Obrien and tore it up!!! Track 3 is beautfully hypnotic in a tripped out sort of way. This is the track that first reeled me in as I was under the influence of Wild Irish Rose watching my friends play Tekken 2. Track 4 (washing machine) is a very episodical and visual song which morphs from dischordant punk to a chill summery breeze of a jam that slowly winds down into practically nothing. Kim Gordon's snotty tuff girl attitude shines through more than ever on songs like 'Little Trouble Girl' and 'Panty Lies'. How can any true fan of alternative music hate this CD? Good experimentation with noise and distortion, yet structured songs... better than previous ""Expermmental Jet Set"" album. Give it a whir"
4,"Snoop Dogg is one of my favorite rappers. I've grown up listening to him since I was a child while he was rhyming on Dr. Dre's ""The Chronic"". I've even stuck by him when he put out bad albums (""The Game Is Sold..."") and when he dropped a decent album (""Paid The Cost...""). ""The Blue Carpet Treatment"" would probably be his best in over a decade if you ask me.  This album is full of laced beats and good rhymes. ""Think About It"" comes off real strong from Snoop laced with a dope beat. The radio hit ""Thats That..."" with R. Kelly gives listeners a nice R&B tune to listen to. As well as the other hit ""I Wanna Love You"" with Akon, another hit for this album.   As I said in my title, this is what ""Cali Iz Active"" should have sounded like. That CD was so horrible and failed to follow it's concept. This album followed what that concept should have been. Most of the guest appearances are form Cali. ""Candy"" would feature Goldie Loc, MC Eiht, E-40, and The Dogg Pound, and a real nice tune to ride to. ""LAX"" with Ice Cube is another standout tune that featured a sample from Biggie's ""Going Back To Cali"" in the hook. I'd say for some reason, my favorite song is toward the end with ""Imagine"" with Dr. Dre. and D'Angelo. Possibly because that piano laced throughout the song. Snoop would close the album with ""Conversations"" with Stevie Wonder, showing off that he's trying to get his mind right. Other guests include The Game, B-Real from Cypress Hill, George Clinton, and Kam (where the hell have YOU been Kam???).  Although this is a good CD I've heard from Snoop in a minute, it still has some rough parts. ""10 Lil' Crips"" sounded kinda weak to me. And I wasn't feeling the song ""Beatin' Up On Yo Pads"" although it's a positive song about him coaching and playing football, but it's a good song, so I'll make it my honorable mention track.  If you heard that this album was his most consistant since ""Doggystyle"", you heard correct. We're more than aware that he's not going to drop another one of those albums, but this is a real good one from Snoop. If other west coast artists drop albums like this, we might have the West Coast making a comeback. And being a fan of West Coast rap music, I am more than ready for it. If you thought Snoop fell off, well he gives doubters ""Tha Blue Carpet Treatment"".  Lyrics: A- Production: A- Guest Appearances: A- Musical Vibes: B Overall: A-  My Favorite Tracks From This Album: Think About It, Thats That..., Candy (Drippin' Like Water), Gangbangn 101, LAX, Which One Of You, I Wanna [Love] You, Psst!, Imagine, Converstions  Honorable Mention Track: Beatin' On Yo Pads  Peace Everyone!!"
1,"Purple City's debut release is ""The Purple Album"" (2006). Having made their mark on the mixtape scene the Dipset affiliate trio of Emperor Shiest Bub, Un Kasa & Don Bishop Agallah provide this release. The Harlem trio start off the album with ""Live Your Life"" repping their group and thanking the Diplomats for paving the way, the best part of this track for me is the chorus. The typical ""Gangsta"" has Shiest Bub collaborating with Jim Jones and Max B backed by the kind of beat that will put you to sleep, the verses are equally boring. Laidback ""Fly High"" follows, backed by some mellow production Purple City pays tribute to smoking weed in what turns out to be a smooth cut. I don't know if Purple City is paying tribute to the South movement, or trying to capitalize on it with ""Trap N****"" either way it's a weak attempt to sound like Young Jeezy, its actually disturbing. ""Go Head"" follows Purple City proclaims being gangster again on another halfhearted cut. ""Nick Nack"" is a lame attempt at a club track, horrible chorus. Tec, Steele and Buckshot drop in for the grimy ""Hustlers"".  Agallah, Un Kasa and affiliate Ike Eyes  team up for another bland cut with ""Picture Me Rollin"". Shiest Bub collabs with A-Mafia on ""Head Bust Open"" rhyming in a braggy manner while warning not to mess with Purple City.  Purple City's decides to spell things out again on ""P.A.Y.D.A.Y."".  While ""Grind Slow"" feat. Buddy Klein is a below average cut where the group talk to the ladies.  Shiest Bub closes the album off with ""Catch Him"" repping himself.  Lyrically this group is not entertaining or original - listening to them I feel like I have heard it all somewhere else before. None of them have distinct flows and production is average.  If you love Dipset and are into that whole movement you may like this. This may sound brutal but listening to the ""The Purple Album"" to me is like watching a bad B Movie, not worth my time. "
2,I was disappointed in the quality of the recording. The needle noise in the recording was more prevalent than on a c.d. that I had burned from an old vinyl record
1,This album is garbage.  I love in flames and i can't find anything nice to say about this album except that when thrown from a moving car it flies really nice and shatters into a million pieces
1,Does anybody have the Live album recorded @ Carnegie Hall??? What a great record that one was.....But I`ve seen it no where...........
1,ITEM NEVER RECEIVED. IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTACT BY EMAIL THE CUSTOMER SERVICE. MY LAST PURCHASE ON AMAZON 
5,"When I first heard this album it captured me.  Now that I've expanded my House collection my tastes have changed a little, but I still consider this to be a stellar Deep House album.  There are enough memorable tracks on this 2-disc set to easily justify owning it.  My favorites are ""Waiting"", ""Next To Me"", ""Don't Stand There"", ""Don't Change"", ""You Can't Stop"", ""Petalpushing"", ""The Remedy"", and ""Lionel's Jam"" (in that order).  I own just about everything Migs has put out and I consider this to be his best.  If I may drop a sales pitch for a couple of his other works it would be Jay-J & Miguel Migs - In The House and Miguel Migs - Colorful You.  This latter one has some incredible R&B tracks.  My only criticism of Miguel Migs is that some of his tracks have too much Reggae and Latin/Jazz for my tastes.  Nevertheless, he is one of the best DJ/Producers I've ever heard.   "
1,"For some reason there seem to be three versions of this album listed separately for sale on Amazon.  One of them only has 13 tracks.  Be sure to get the version with 14 tracks because the 14th track is too good to miss.  ""Down the Line"" is one of the live songs and you absolutely want to have that cut.  This review seems to appear in several versions of the albu"
1,uninspired and down right boring. I feel I wasted over an hour of my life listening to this disc..
4,"Being a fan of mostly punk rock music... I decided to give this a try. This record is highly entertaining, very fun and very original. I didnt even know that &quot;gypsy-punk&quot; existed untill I heard this. The musicianship is quite good as well. Chanty, boot stompin' songs with accordians and fiddles. I like it. I reccomend this if you like the more folky brands of punk rock (ie Swingin' Utters, Tossers, etc.) So, if you're willing to give something different a try, go ahead and pick this up"
4,"This double cd is awsome! Nick Warrens mixing ability is so awsome and it earns the Global Underground name.  The cd is pretty dark and the songs are not popular club hits, but if you buy this, you shouldnt be expecting it.  This cd really puts me into a trance and i love listening to it, expecially when im driving. I would totally buy this cd to mix up your collection"
1,"I ran out and bought this cd the very day it came out.  Then sat listening anxiously for something to stir inside of me.  Alas, nothing.  A few weeks later, still nothing.  A month later, I tried again.  I yawned...  Then I got up and cleaned the kitchen finding that more interesting.  When I first started listening to Zero 7, I was drawn, pulled, attached to their music.  I got it, it got me--we connected.  My friend Mel asked me the other day how this cd was and I let her listen to it; she yawned and said, ""I guess they've lost it"".  Should they release another cd, I'd borrow it from the library first and then buy it only if I really love it.  But this cd was deeply disappointing.."
5,That cd is just touching and well made by Zero 7. Zero 7 is awsome and I am your fan also. Thank you for so much.
5,"** This CD is really my favorite, even above the Fred and Mary Mary. Also even above the mass choirs, this CD is my favorite because of its closeness and realness to me. Not only does Canton Jones get you crunk, but you can realy feel the lyrics because of their truth and accuracy in this generation. You can't help but be lifted, be drawn, and get ""bout it"" for Christ!   "
5,"O.K. folks here we go, from an ex- Santa Barbara disc jockey to you. The best song on this excellent CD is Las Vegas Tango. What should blow your mind about this song is the multirhythmic backing of Elvin Jones on drum. The band itself is tight and strong. The song is kinda haunting. I've hummed it to myself for the past forty years, and after losing the album a while back, I bought a new CD of it through Amazon.com from England, and I am very happy I own it. I think everyone should own at least one of this, one for themselves and one to give to a friend. This album, and particularly Las Vegas Tango, is one of the best outputs of any band during the 20th century. Buy it"
1,"this album is terrible.  just useless noise.  i also own electric pink and very emergency.  if you liked those albums, you will agree that this one is garbage"
5,"Just can't praise this CD too highly.  I usually stick with classical music (Mozart, Stamitz etc) but this CD,has opened up a whole new dimension.  I just play it over and over.  Never get tired of it."
5,"If you love all things James Brown, then you must buy this collection of funky hits (tinged with more than a hint of jazz) he did with his 70's band, the JBs.  Believe me, you will not be able to resist the beat! The excellent horn work of Maceo Parker and Fred Wesley are worth the price of the CD alone. The majority of the cuts are R&amp;B dancing and roller skating classics, especially, &quot;(It's Not The Express) It's The JBs Monorail&quot;, &quot;Gimme Some More&quot;, &quot;Pass The Peas&quot;, &quot;Same Beat&quot;, and &quot;Damn Right, I'm Somebody&quot;.  &quot;Think&quot;, with vocals by Lyn Collins, is just too funky for words.  Don't pass this one by"
5,"Now I know everybody would love this CD.  It is definately for the young AND old.  The tracks sound great and the new liner notes are amazing.  A great mix of Loverboy's best hits, including Working For the Weekend!!"
1,I had to return this album to Amazon after receiving an emil from them stating that it contained Sony malware.  Poor Jane! Caught up with these creeps! 
2,When I got this cd I thought it was the music from the first version and that is the main reason I bought it. Its an ok cd just not my taste in music
1,"michelle zacharias , i totally agree with you. I can believe the ruined such a good movie qith such a terrible ending, Im looking for the hollywood version as well, for I think that jacqes should have learnt the lesson with enzos suicide and value life, especially when he is going to have a child from the beautifull woman he loves"
2,I have searched and searched for Bill Conti's alternate motion picture score and I have had no luck.  Does anyone know how to find Bill Conti's Soundtrack Specialist?  Eric Serra's score was good but I was disappointed when I purchased it and it was NOT what I thought I bought.  Email me at mszacharias@yahoo.com if anyone has any information on how to find it.  Thanks
1,"I can't believe people like Eazy-E more than Dr.Dre. Dre is way better than sleazy-e. Stay with Dre, not sleazy-e"
2,"...but I listen to them even less!  I bought this album at random a few years ago.  My first impression after I bought it was &quot;mediocre British band&quot;.  I've listened to it a couple times since then, the most recent today, and my impression hasn't changed.  If it weren't for the fact that Brian Eno contributed to this album I'd probably give it one star"
2,"Only"", the second single from ""With Teeth"", has something in common with its predecessor-- its of limited value. I picked it up and was pretty disappointed.  The single itself, ""Only"", isn't one of the ones I particularly enjoy on the album-- its got a nice enough funky bass line and drum beat, but Reznor's sing-speak ""Down In It"" styled vocal grates and the piece doesn't particularly hold my interest. Certainly it lacks the immediacy of ""Down In It"", and I'm generally inclined to want Reznor to look forward, not backward.  The b-sides aren't much better-- the DFA mix of ""The Hand That Feeds"" is yet another remix, this one pretty much a full techno mix. It's quite different, replete with an odd panting sample that gets somewhat irritating as the piece never ends (it rambles on for well over seven minutes). The live version of ""Love is Not Enough"" is the only saving grace on the single-- while its not one of the better songs on the record, its decent enough, and live it got bigger. The arrangement is the same, but its more direct and in your face.  For the casual listener, skip this one. The fan will be buying it regardless of what I say, but it's in line with the recent singles, not the older (and superior) ones"
2,"Someone pointed out in another review that the songs are presented in the original mono versions.  More than that, I also have the Chartbusters (12 cds) Mowtown compilation and in addition some old vinyl recordings, and I have noticed that the actual _mixes_ are not even the same as the original recordings.  For instance, on Stevie Wonder's ""For Once In My Life"" and Glady Knight and the Pips' ""I Heard It Through The Grapevine"" there are parts that are just plain missing.  I'm very disappointed, as my favorite songs do not sound at all as I remember them. Update:  I listened again.  I think I might have been mistaken when I said that parts were just plain missing.  I think it's just that the mono versions actually bury things that come across more clearly in the stereo versions.  It just a shame that the original record company couldn't have done a better job in light of the advent of the CD"
5,"I have been listening to Jazz for 31 years now, and have not discovered a better album than this.  You get Miles in his prime, Trane AND Cannonball,  and a rhythm section that was just SICK.  Every track swings.  Every note is ON.  Do yourself a favor: GET THIS CD RIGHT NOW!!"
2,"I grew up listening to her ""In Concert"" album, and bought the Pearl album based on reviews saying this was a more mature style for her music.  I like her old style better, this sounds like she was trying to make a more pop sound for her music (although the singing wasn't much different).  It not only didn't sound like what you expect from Janice Joplin, it sounded like a muzak imitation of her"
5,"Ralph Stanley is a God of bluegrass and this CD shows us why. The man's voice has such character and presence and power. The music is as good as bluegrass gets and the harmonies are great.  There is a good variety of music on this CD. From barn burners to slow mournful dirges, its all here. You wouldnt think that an album full of songs about death would be uplifting, but it is.  Highly Recommended"
2,"My mistake. I had only heard ""Should've Been The One"" which I thought sounded very good. That, however, was the only song produced in the studio and unfortunately the only song I liked enough to justify the purchase. The rest of the songs are live, apparently recorded at a small venue, if you can judge by the applause. Like I said...my fault. Not saying any of the songs are bad. Maybe more of them will grow on me. Just not what I expected. Moral: it pays to listen to most of a CD before you buy it.(duh) You never know what you're gonna get"
5,"I bought this album when I was 17. I'm now 31 and I still haven't recovered! This album, as said before, represents the indie punk ideal only feinted at by Nirvana, Sonic Youth etc. Steve Albini and co assault you here with a white-hot mind-melting onslaught  of musical savagery, from the beserk guitar-driven Colombian Necktie through the nosebleed-inducing Pavement Saw to the juddering, sinister colossus of Tiny, King of the Jews. Sheer uncompromising overbuilt punk, this represents Big Black at their zenith. With bands like this in the world there's no excuse for mediocrity"
5,"If forced to pick one band that best exemplified the indie-rock aesthetic, one would be hard-pressed to find a better choice than Big Black.  Many of the acts typically credited with bringing alternative music to the mainstream have, for better or worse, been little more than angry pop acts (Nirvana and Nine Inch Nails being prominent examples), and even many more underground acts such as Pixies, Sonic Youth, and the Jesus Lizard released some material that was palatable to the mainstream, as their major-label runs attest.  Big Black, on the other hand, was the real deal, a band that lived out the indie philosophy in both their music and in their resolutely do-it-yourself business practices, and paid the commercial price for it.  Songs About F***ing was the perfect distillation of leader Steve Albini's philosophy: an abrasive, confrontational album that contained no concessions to the mainstream and no pretensions to socially redeeming value.  This is music at its most twisted and evil, acknowledging no taboos as it challenged listeners to take or leave its assaultive sound and unpleasant lyrical content.    The key to the lasting appeal of this release lies largely in its simplicity.  Like fellow pioneering noise-merchants Godflesh, Big Black distilled rock music to its most basic elements: guitar, bass, and drum machine.  In spite of this minimal approach, however, Songs About F***ing is hardly palatable or unchallenging.  What emerges from this combination of rock's traditional elements is a barrage of scathing, disembowling noise that pummels eardrums with a mix of astringent guitar squalls and pulsating industrial beasts.  And of course, it's all topped off with the demented vocal stylings of Albini himself, making Kurt Cobain sound like Mel Torme as he howled and screamed his tales of depravity.    Mixing metal, punk, and the then-burgeoning genre of industrial with reckless abandon, Songs About F***ing constitutes a musical roller coaster of frightening proportions, and wraps things up in barely half an hour.  The basslines and drum programming of Bad Penny and Colombian Necktie are enough to crack skulls, while Albini's vocals legitimately bring to mind a man in the midst of a nervous breakdown.  L-Dopa is all punkish speed and aggression but infinitely more frightening, and the proto-industrial rage of Precious Thing and Kasimir N. Pulaski Day would send Trent Reznor up a tree.  Even when the band slows down, as on Kitty Empire, the results are clenched, sinister, and intense.  Tiny, King of the Jews (love that title) actually manages to be somewhat atmospheric, but it still relies heavily on that mix of disconcerting guitar noise and pulsating beats.  I've listened to pretty much every noted act in the extreme-music world, from Slayer to Godflesh to Meshuggah, and Big Black may have been the scariest of all.  And Songs about F***ing in an unqualified triumph, one that oozes menace and integrity at the same time.  Own it, or pose"
4,"First off, consider the packaging. The title SONGS ABOUT F--KING rendered in loving bold, and cover art that puts all ""shock rockers"" (that means you, Marilyn Manson) in their place. That alone makes it worth adding to your collection. Too bad this was the band's last release. Leave it to Steve to break a band up just as they were attracting an audience.    Big Black is pure nihilism in audio form. A young Steve Albini (pre-Shellac and before he was reduced to producing Bush albums) backed by a constantly pulsing drum machine named Roland and furiously feedback-driven guitar noise while ranting his stories of Midwest depravity and illness with an almost infectious glee. This is what happens when Kraftwerk goes to hell (they even cover that German duo's The Model here), or when a bunch of angry, drunk, baseball bat-wielding nerds start playing New Wave while setting a trailer park on fire. Though there have been faster bands, heavier bands, nobody has ever sounded so gritty and hateful as these guys do.    Ah.. enough hyperbole. So, why only four stars (actually 4.5)? Well, there's nothing as great as previous albums' Steelworker, Bad Houses, Kerosene, or Jordan, Minnesota--songs that are so definitive of Big Black's style. However, there are plenty of songs that come awful close: The poppy yet deliciously evil Bad Penny (""I think I f--ked your girlfriend once, maybe twice, I don't remember""), the demented almost-surf rock of Columbian Necktie, the eerie proto-industrial grind of Kitty Empire, the vicious Fish Fry, and the lovely free-floating hostility of Tiny, King Of The Jews. Also notable is a cover of Cheap Trick's He's A Whore that strips away the innuendo and leaves just the grimy sleaze.   Essential music for the misanthrope in all of us. Also recommended highly are fellow Touch & Go outfits The Jesus Lizard and Albini's later ""supergroup"" Rapeman."
5,"I'm so thrilled to discover this recording is out on CD as I've worn out my cassette. Brilliant playing, group interaction...the sense of urgency in this performance as Bill neared the end of his life his heart-rending.  I never write reviews but this is one of my favorite albums of all time"
2,"I'd like to start by saying how amazing New American Gospel is.  Then by saying what a solid follow-up As The Palaces Burn is.  Lamb of God is truly one of the best American thrash/metalcore acts.  However, If you enjoy either of their first releases, I would recommend skipping this one.  It's disappointing and generic.  If you're considering buying this and don't own the previous albums, buy them first.  Lamb of God is an aggressive, technically skilled band, and I really expect their next release to be a comeback after this one"
1,"I loved the big guy on American Idol, hell I even voted for him, but this CD is so blah! Everything sounds the same. I can tell the CD was rushed of course, and they thought the tracks would be good just b/c he has a great voice. Ever since he won he's just been goin downhill. And i'm not one for playing the race-card here, but in this case, COME ON! Mr. Girly Man Aiken gets the cover of Rolling Stone and all Ruben gets is the cover of JET?! He was the winner for goodness sake! I guess it all can't be fair. And Hello! has anyone seen the video for Sorry 2004? If a stalker ever had a theme song that one's it. Followin the poor girl,peakin around corners, puh-lease! I couldn't give the CD less than one star, otherwise, baby boy, u woulda got negative NONE! Zip zero, no dinero"
5,"Alan Jackson is truly one of the best new country singers around. I enjoyed his version of all of these songs. He actually sings them better than the original singers, Farewell Party and Kiss An Angel Good Morning are so  well done. I hope  he comes out with another CD of this kind"
1,"Don't buy this album.  You would have to have pretty drab music taste to like this generic, emotionless, tired, garbage.  Merkin Dream is clearly ripping off any worthwhile downtempo group that they find fitting (ie. Massive Attack, Air, Everything But the Girl), plus there is no vocal talent in the 3 songs they actually sing in.  Someone thought Track 7 was funny or cute because a robotic voice says, ""Does my hard drive turn you on?""  What is wrong with you people?  If you want decent robo-pop music, try Kraftwerk, Figurine, or even Ladytron.  My advice to Merkin Dream is to stop making music because you're brainwashing poor children out there into thinking you're something good"
2,"I love George Strait's music.If you look at my profile you will see that I have rated numerouse other cd's of his and gave them all 5 star. He is my favorite artist, but this cd is just plain bad."
5,"Some of this is quite pretty - - ""Kometenmelodie 2"", in fact, waxes practically majestic.  And it's true:  the title track glides along with four wheels off the ground for 22 minutes or so.  And the recorder piece that closes the album (replete with little birdies twittering all over the place) is a bit of a pleasant and unexpected surprise; ""Morgenspaziergang"", after all, translates as ""A Morning Walk"".  Not quite of its time, and slightly before it, you have a bona fide classic here.  Fah'n on."
1,MAN YOU CANT EVEN MAKE OUT MOST OF THE SONG MAKE'S YOU THINK YOUR CD PLAYER IS BUGGING AND NEEDS TO BE CLEANED OR 86/JUNKED MAN TV-GUIDE NEED TO WATCH WERE THEY PUT THERE LOGO OVER THEY MIGHT HAVE SOMEONE IN THE PARKING LOT LOOKING FOR THERE MONEY BACK WITH SMILE ON THERE FACE BUT NOT THE KIND YOU WANT TO SEE ON SOMEONE UNLESS YOUR CRAZY ALSO AND WANT TO HANG OUT AND HIT THE PIPE WITH THEM AND BUG OUT TOGETHER !!!!!!
4,"As a fan of Bobby Darin, it was a treat to hear him perform in the old Las Vegas.  The way entertainment should be in any venue.  Because of the 100th Anniversary of Las Vegas, the album will become part of my collection celebrating this momentous event.  Don't miss this one of a kind CD"
2,"While it seems to be the tendency of many Cave fans to drool over anything the man records, this is not an album that is up to par with many of his other efforts.  There are some stand out tracks such as ""Deanna"" and ""Mercy"", but many of the rest come off as either overwrought or overly bombastic.  Obviously, if you're already a fan, you'll want this disc regardless, but to anyone new to Nick Cave's work I recommend his ""Best of"" collection or ""The Boatman's Call"""
4,"I've been listening to Soul Coughing religiously for years now and was thrilled when this disc was released (even though I knew I'd have almost all the material on it). Although all the songs here are well worthy of being here, I feel there are some songs missing that need to be here. Where are ""Fully Retractable"" and ""I Miss the Girl"", two of the funkiest Soul Coughing tracks? I am very pleased, however, that ""Unmarked Hellicopters"" was put on here despite not being on a precious Soul Coughing release. All in all this is a great disc, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good overwiew of soul coughing's music. However, I'm sure other die hard soul coughing fans will agree that there are some great tunes missing from this disc"
5,"Despite the very obvious issues with overdubbing, this is a GREAT release form the sisters. An album after being absent for 14 years?! What more can any Clark fan expect. I'm surprised to see contributions from Karen and Dorinda in terms of writing. Since Twinkie has been writing the music for 30 years, I figured that the case would be the same. What a nice surprise. Karen and Dorinda are both great song writers."
4,"OK so everyone has different tastes but to my mind some of Glenn`s best work did not make the cut on this album.  Instead we`ve been given work which has`nt appeared in any of Glenn`s previous releases, Common Ground, Who`s been sleepin in my bed etc, which while good pale beside I Volunteer, That Girl, Some Kind of Blue which all sound like they could have been Eagles tunes.  Having said that it is a good album although I would recommend Soul Searchin, Strange Weather ahead of this one.  Further proof that the Eagles whole is better than its part"
2,"Personally, I like the other albums from Staind. I love ""Dysfunction"", I like ""Break the Cycle"", ""14 Shades..."" was tolerable, and I really enjoyed ""Chapter V"". However, even for a debut, ""Tormented"" just sounds inmmature. There's emotion, but I lost count on the how many times the ""f-word"" is not only mentioned on the album, but on each song alone. Then again, Fred Durst produced this band in the first place, so that probably had a lot to do with it. All in all, the album itself just flat out sucks"
1,"George picked the worst way to show his voice.Songs are so boring and he doesn't stay in the right key! Save your money and buy Bo Bice's new AWESOME, AMAZING, album called The Real Thing! Bo will show you how it's done! Bo's the REAL DEAL folks! Bo blows all the other Idols who ever went on the show out of the water, makes them look real bad, yuck for Georgie!"
5,Great music... I have listened to a vast amount of  New Orlean's numbers and find this music very entertaining
5,"Finally some good old fashion HEAVY thrash metal from thrash giants The Haunted. I will say that every track is amazing, it's a non stop pulsating blast of thrash shoved down your thropat and bursting your ear drums. Yes it is that good. Now maybe I've over hyped it,  but I loved it that much. I haven't heard something this good since Carnal Forge! For fan of Carnal Forge, Slayer, and Lamb of God, you definately must check this band out! Good musicianship, fast paced, brutal, and heavy thrash is what can be found here. A must buy"
1,"Oh, stop whining ... they're pretty smart in one sense.  They knew they had a good thing with ""I Like to Move It.""  Do I like it?  No.  Do I understand it?  Sure.  There are plenty of schmoes who will impulse buy and pay the whole thing.   Me?  I plan on buying it later when the price goes down.  To e-bay we go! "
5,"XTC didn't start out with any remote idea of aspiring to the very stifling punk classicism of the day.The only relation  'White Music' has to punk is the simple three chord structures.  Otherwise tunes like the catchy &quot;This Is Pop&quot; and the offbeat,  quircky reggae of &quot;All Along The Watchtower&quot; have more relation to not only early British invasion music but to the more abstract musical experiments of American avante rockers.Neither is this in any way typical XTC-in years to come the band would  develope a sound much more melodic and sweet (neither of those  terms ever apply to this music) but the stuttering vocals and  Andy Partirdge's clever humor are more then enough to carry this album.From a guy whose more interested in funk and fusion normally I find this album worth a listen-'White Music' will  definately command your attention.And it's not too loud either"
5,"Alan Is One The Best Country Singers Today. When I First Heard &quot;She's Got The Rhythm (And I Got The Blues)&quot; I Began To Like It. He Can Sang Romantic Ballads Like: &quot;(Who Says) You Can't Have It All&quot; A Top  Ten Hit In Early 1994. The Songs I Like On This Album Are: &quot;Tonight I  Climbed The Wall&quot;, &quot;Mercury Blues&quot;, 1993's Big Number 1 Hit  &quot;Chattahoochee&quot;. You've Got To Buy This Album"
2,"NOT A LOT ELSE TO BE HONEST.  So many people have been fooled in to believing this band is amazing simply because of the speed that they play at, but to be honest is speed really everything?  All the songs on the CD lack creativity and sounds pretty much the same as the last song .  Every fu**ing track on this album is plagued with fast drum beats, some crappy power metal riff that remains throughout the song and lightning fast guitar solos which is impressive when you've heard one but by the end of the CD its a drag.  Don't get me wrong, to be able to play this takes a hell of a lot of skill and ability, but they need to use that skill and ability to come up with something a lot more creative and inventive"
1,One WEAK night!...zero stars if that was available. I never realized Bon Jovi was this bad a live band. They obviously get a LOT of production help in the studio because this album (several different concerts in several different venues) is ALL bad.  Sorry for them and sorry for me for buying it
4,"There seems little point to classifying this music. When standard tunes from the American Songbook and jazz idioms such as swing and bebop spark little to no recognition among the general public, music that could once be called ""experimental"" or ""avant garde"" necessarily defines the modern mainstream. If there are similarities with early landmark recordings (e.g. Miles Davis' 70s fusion groups),  ""Lawn Chair Society"" would definitely qualify as the less raw and extemporaneous, more polished and civil descendant of its once-controversial forebears.  Aside from electronics and musical synthesis, three qualities in particular stand out about this music: composition is emphasized above improvisation; creativity and craftsmanship count for more than interpretation and invention (both of which require a standard repertoire); tonal colors, dynamics and humor receive the kind of attention they enjoyed with Duke Ellington, before the ""bebop revolution.""  Lest any listeners require the ""jazz"" label to enjoy this music, Kenny Werner has called on the A Team for this multifarious collection of tone poems and programmatic pieces. The trumpet of Dave Douglas and bass clarinet of Chris Potter descend on ""Lo's Garden"" like a busy, darting pair of humming birds (joined at the hip, naturally). Soon a more vegetative pace is established by Scott Colley's firmly grounded bass while Brian Blade's percussion alternates between following movement at the sub-particle and quantum-field levels. Meanwhile, Werner's keyboards paint patterns in waves of sound, moving from prepared piano to phased Fender wahs, with a dab of string synth for highlighting.  ""Burble_burble_spleek"" is as onomatopoeic as the title--wind chimes, telephone rings and Douglas playing some of the most vocalized (and intestinal) trumpet sounds this side of Clark Terry and Rex Stewart. ""Uncovered Heart,"" a calming guitar-like ballad in E Major, is soon followed by the ambitious title number-- a collage of funked-up chatter, vocalized demagoguery by each horn player, some thoughtful discourse by Werner on piano, a ghostly dirge-like refrain intoned by unison horns, and finally the faint sounds of birds and hunters (certainly not a reference to a familiar White House-Halliburton figure?).  Closure comes not with a bang but with ""Loss,"" essentially a richly-textured chorale by synthesized strings, followed by ""Kothbiro,"" an extended peaceful incantation based on a simple African melody.  In conclusion, if ""Kind of Blue"" and Bill Evans' Vanguard Sessions are in your blood, this one is unlikely to replace either one.  All the same, it's well-conceived, smartly-executed, cutting-edge mixed-genre jazz"
2,"Eeyucch. Sounds like being stuck waiting for someone in the lobby of a Vegas hotel while the housekeeping staff is cleaning up in the background. Oh look, isn't that Wayne Newton over there"
2,"I like Slayer.  I really do.  This is one of the fastest, heaviest metal bands in existance, but I could never get in to their early albums, especially Hell Awaits.  I tend to prefer their later albums like Reign in Blood, because they were much better produced.  Rick Rubin made those records sound the way a speed metal record should, with everything up front in your face.  Reign in Blood had the most ""in your face"" sound of any record I've ever heard.  Hell Awaits on the other hand is just soaked in so much reverb that it sometimes reminds me of ""Pyromania"" by Def Leppard!  This is one of the heaviest bands in existance.  How is a speed metal band supposed to sound heavy when their producer insists on making them in to the speed metal version of Def Leppard?  Thrash is supposed to be ""in your face"".  There's no place for reverb on a speed metal record.  You want to hear heavilly reverbed production, than go buy a Def Leppard CD!  I myself prefer a more aggressive style that fits this kind of music.  Down with reverb!  I HATE reverb!  Layers of reverb have no place in speed metal"
2,"The selection of songs for this cd is excellent, however unable to leave well enough along they include overblown intros, restarts, embellishments etc making the original tune almost unrecognizable.  The arranger should be shot"
1,"Several songs on this album are note for note copied from Titus.  Has Tyler Bates no shame?  The original composer (Titus' Elliot Goldenthal) created an awesome score, buy it instead"
4,"Part of me wishes that Frank Black had condensed this 2 disc album into 1 really great album, but it's still, on the whole, a really great CD.  You'll fall in love with these songs"
1,"I love Balkan Beatbox and Matisyahu.. but ""so called seder"" was a so called... nightmare!  I was actually appalled I had purchased it without hearing many of the songs. I know it's acceptable to say certain things in rap/hip-hop.. but when it comes to our music.. please don't even go there!!  I was hoping for something more along the lines of Balkan Beatbox or Matisyahu, but sadly suprised at the lyrics I was hearing and sent it back to J-Dub with a letter why.. *sigh"
1,"I BOUGHT THIS CD FOR MY SON - WE ARE SEARCHING FOR GOOD R&amp;B / RAP WITH A POSITIVE MESSAGE - WE WERE VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS CD - THE RECORDING QUALITY WAS LACKING, THE BEATS VERY REPETITIVE AND UNINSPIRING, YOU COULD HARDLY HEAR THE WORDS - OVERALL - WE ARE LISTING THIS CD FOR SALE AND WE JUST BOUGHT IT YESTERDAY! MY HUSBAND, SON AND I ALL AGREED WITHIN TEN MINUTES THAT THIS CD WAS NOT A WINNER"
5,"Our family has enjoyed listening to this very much, we received it just in time for St. Patrick's Day"
5,"Spice delivers another classic for his fourth effort (and it's one of his top 3 albums). It has 15 songs, of which 4 are classics, 2 are near classics, 6 are good, 2 are ok, and 1 I skip. Guests are few and production is great. Produced by Blackjack (4 songs), Chase & Bosko (3 songs each), Ant Banks and Payback (2 songs each). It's a shame he didn't get no airplay over here on the east coast cause he'd have definitely gone multi-platinum as he deserves to do. Even though I'm used to Southern Cali rappers from MC Eiht to Ice Cube to CJ Mac, Spice did it with 1990-Sick to put the Bay on the map of gangsta rap.  The song 1990-Sick(Kill' Em All) featuring MC Eiht is a strong & heavy  Thug'sta song about haulicinations, Dirty Bay is a hard classic delivered by Dr.Bomb from da Bay, Sucka Ass Nigga featuring G-Nut is a hard Ice-T like hard hitter, and of course Spice has a horrorcore song called Snitch Killas that sounds like something of the Geto Boys or Ice Cube, this is Spice's #1 Album!  Freddy Chico's best are *1(featuring MC Eiht), *2, 3, 4(featuring Kokane), 5, 6, 7, *8(featuring G-Nut), 9, 10, 11, 12, *13, 14(featuring E-40) & 15."
4,"I bought this several years ago (before Amazon was around), and I love it. I loved the song ""Bangkok"" back when it got so much airplay in the 80's, and it was a pleasure to hear the rest of the musical. However, after spending $35 on the 2 disc set, one of the cd's cracked after a few plays. It wasn't my player, or anything like that - it just simply cracked. So one of these days I will replace it, and then I will be SURE to make a backup straight off just in case.   Also, I've never heard the Broadway version, but my husband has listened to both and says the original London cast version is far superior"
2,"Fat Joe's (A.K.A. Jose Antonio Cartagena) seventh solo album is ""Me, Myself and I"". Those familiar with his work may have noticed the album cover is similar to one of better releases his third album ""Don Cartagena"". The Bronx MC keep's this release short at twelve track's, and this album has three guest appearances which come from The Game, Lil Wayne and H-Mob. Production comes from Street Runner, LV, The Runner's DJ Khaled, Nu Jerzey Devil & Scott Scorch. The Runner's provide some of the best production on ""No Drama"" (Clap And Revolve) a grimy sounding cut. Lyrically Fat Joe is his usual braggy less then entertaining self for most of this album. His lyrics are as egotistical as his album titles. My problem with Fat Joe resides in the fact that he never puts any of his people on, instead following the same formula time after time. The Terror Squad is a crew full of talented MC's (even with the loss of Cuban Link and Triple Seis) and singer Tony Sunshine has a lot of potential - all of them get put on the back burner each year for a less then impressive Fat Joe album. Two of this album's closing track deserve some praise - Fat Joe's dedication to his Mom on ""Bendicion Mama"" and the follow up cut ""Story To Tell"" are decent. Buyer Beware, satisfaction not guaranteed"
5,"Excellent transaction, this CD was in perfect condition. I've spent hours of amazing fun listening to this amazing artist. thanks so much for such a great transaction"
5,"I have purchased both Awakened Mind System discs (original and 2.0) and both are amazing.  They have taken my meditations to a whole new level.  They are also great for power napping or doing creative work.  I feel that the Awakened Mind System discs are better than many of Thompson's other discs for two reasons.  First, AMS uses combinations of all brainwave frequencies (beta, alpha, theta, delta) which makes you feel both relaxed and energized, peaceful and creative, dreamy and focused, all at once.  This makes AMS useful for many different activities.  Second, they are outstanding for meditation because the music is purely ambient and abstract.  Many of Thompson's other discs, including the Theta Meditation System, use some ambience interspersed with repetitive melodies which can be quite distracting while meditating.  If you're looking for music to deepen your meditation, enhance your mental functioning, or even help you sleep, try the Awakened Mind System"
2,"Ok so i was reading the reveiw for this album and i heard a lot of people talkin trash, and a lot of people talkin candy canes and butterflys. So im here to set the record straight.   First of all, to all the folks who think this band is so great... Yes in the early years they had a good sound, and their songs ant bad, but they really sold out. You can walk into any mall right now and find sum 12 year old wearing a casualties shirt, or hat, or wallet, or patch, or toilet seat. They did the warped tour for gods sack. They obviously are worried more about money and fame then music. This has turned into teenybopper music, the same little @#!^'s that listen to blink 182 and sum 41 have this album. They go into a hot topic and buy it on cd with their mommys credit card, along with a 50 dollar pair of pants that look like sumone made in a clown college. This is not a great punk band, its punk for yuppies.  And to all the people that think its the worst band ever... I am so sick of hearing idiots that think they know everything about punk trashing the casualties saying they are fashion punks... Wether you wunna believe it or not punk has always had to do with clothes... Look at the new york dolls, alice cooper, richard hell, or the sex pistols. They all had a look, a image, and they started this whole thing. ""they said hey richard are you going to go out tonight, i said i am unsertent, I ant feeling to right. But i WRIPED UP MY SHIRT, watched the mirror and flirt, yeah im going to go out, out into sight."". And im sick of hearing about how they dont know how to play... NO punk bands know how to play, one of the reasons that punk is so great is that anyone can pick up a guitar or a drum set and start a group.   So in closing, your all idiots that know nothing about punk music, old or new. your opinions reflect your ignorance about the punk scene and non of you should ever call your selves punks."
4,"Of all of Tupac's post death material, this is probably my favourite album.  Though some may complain that the songs were not as Pac intended, I think they are a fitting tribute to him and for the most part, the updated production is great.  Most will already have heard the singles ""letter 2 My Unborn"" and ""Until The End Of Time"", both are great, and it is easy to see why they were chosen as singles.  Other notable tracks are ""This Aint Livin"" which is probably the best track on here, ""Breathin"", ""Everything They Owe"", ""Lastonesleft"", ""M.O.B"" and ""World Wide Mob Figgaz"".  In fact most of the tracks on here are at least good.  It goes without saying that this album is not as good as the material Pac produced while alive, after all these are his throw away songs.  Just goes to show what a genius Pac was, that these are songs he didn't consider good enough for his albums, they put most other rappers A tracks to shame.  I give it 4 stars because there are a few filler tracks and The Outlawz are just on here too much.  While I have a load of respect for The Outlawz for staying true to Pac, I just don't rate their rapping skills too highly.  Anyway an amazing album, especially considering Pac had been dead for 5 years when this was released.  R.I.P Tupac "
4,"&quot;Super Hits of the '70's - Have A Nice Day Vol. 21&quot; contains yet more of those '70's power-pop Top 40 tunes you've come to know and love. This collection focuses on the late '70's - specifically late 1977/early 1978. Ram Jam's &quot;Black Betty&quot; kicks things off into high gear, with an unmistakable Southern-rock, hard-edged flair. As the Autumn months of '77 rolled around, moviegoers hadn't quite gotten their fill of the box-office mega-flick &quot;Star Wars&quot;, which was released in theaters earlier that summer, so a discofied rendition of John Williams' original score was released - this version by Meco titled &quot;Star Wars Theme/Cantina Band&quot;, which hit the Billboard charts big-time and made it to number one, as well. The Los Angeles-based group Player reaped adequate rewards from their first single titled &quot;Baby Come Back&quot;, released during early '78. Player's success was short-lived however, and saw just two more singles enter the charts during the course of the year, and disbanded soon afterward. The absolute worst song of all time appears on this collection - Meri Wilson's &quot;Telephone Man&quot;. Whoever had the foresight to include this clutter here had to have been on battery acid, as it is just plain horrible and incredibly insipid - which is why &quot;Have A Nice Day Vol. 21 gets four stars instead of five. Now that we've gotten that senseless, moronic &quot;tune&quot; out of the way, let us continue onward. Ex-Spirit and Jo Jo Gunne member Jay Ferguson, who had a hit with the former group and sang lead on the single &quot;I've Got A Line On You&quot; in the late '60's, contributes here with his only solo chart effort &quot;Thunder Island&quot;, released in the Spring of '78. If it's wispy, sentimental ballads that you crave, there's Dan Hill's &quot;Sometimes When We Touch&quot;, a major hit in both the U.S. and Canada also during the Spring of '78. For a howlingly good time, ghouls, ghosts and goblins will have a frightfully good time with Warren Zevon's &quot;Werewolves Of London&quot;. Moviegoers in the Winter of '77/'78 will recognize ex-Bread frontman David Gates' &quot;Goodbye Girl&quot; from the movie of the same name, which was released in April of '78 after the motion picture's release. Wales's Bonnie Tyler had her first big hit with &quot;It's A Heartache&quot; during the Summer of '78, as well as did Michael Johnson with his hit - the melancholic tear jerker &quot;Bluer Than Blue&quot;. Before Exile jumped the pop ship into country music waters, they hit it big with &quot;Kiss You All Over&quot;, written by two of the group's members - Mike Chapman and Nicky Chinn, who became songwriters and mega-producers for other artists during the late '70's and early '80's. Finally, to round out this collection of chartbusters, there's Walter Egan's top twenty smash &quot;Magnet And Steel&quot;, which also features backing vocals courtesy of Fleetwood Mac's Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. As far as &quot;Telephone Man&quot; is concerned, I felt Rhino could have utilized better singles for this collection from that era in its place, such as Dolly Parton's &quot;Here You Come Again&quot;, or Firefall's &quot;Just Remember I Love You&quot; (both released in Autumn of '77), to name a few, although there are several other singles from this time period that could have definitely gotten the nod over &quot;Telephone Man&quot;. Even though we're stuck with TM, &quot;Have A Nice Day Vol. 21&quot; is still a good arrangement of superbly crafted pop tunes to have in your CD collection at any rate. A must have for completeists of this 25 volume series"
5,"If you mix up the awesome Primitives from the 80s, with the Spector wall of sound , in a Swedish garage with some power pop licks you might get something like The Legends. That being said they are not rigidly classifiable. Just great music.  This was one CD I was glad I got and have played it the most in the last couple of months."
2,"I can't believe how watered down and lifeless this album sounds! SOUL ASYLUM released an absolute winner with ""Hang Time"", a perfect blend of pop, punk and metal. With ""And the Horse They Rode in On"", I am truly baffled as to what happened. First off, even if you actually like the music here in, the cover is GOD AWFUL!!! And that title! What was going on Dave Pirner's mind?!?! Now, before you lovers of this album hang me, this release has its moments. ""Spinning"" starts off great and it's a great follow up song to the ""Hang Time"" album. But from there, the songs are a mixture of hit and miss with no real stand out tracks. And the production makes SOUL ASYLUM sound as bland as your favorite JELL-O flavor. For an ex-hardcore band this is really a low point. The songs sound as if something's about to happen, but in the end we are left wondering what happened. The irony of it all is that SOUL ASYLUM's so called ""sell out"" album (you know what album!)has more balls than this release!!! Sad but true, but what's even sadder is that Dave Pirner is actually a good songwriter and I'll have to wonder what made his mind so dry as to put this mediocre album out"
4,this album covers all of maries long career and every track down memory lane is a gem a must for osmond fans.if you are not a fan you will be after listening to the best of marie osmond
2,This CD Sucks. I mean Bruce Springstein is such a has been. Dude retire please!  U2 also another has been group. I think someone needs to revamp the Grammy nominations and choose some really great music. Ya know songs that will last forever and never grow old!!
5,"Iron Maiden's seventh studio album fittingly called Seventh Son of a Seventh Son was released in April of 1988. The album was the band;s first new studio album in nearly two years and would be their last with guitarist Adrian Smith until his return on 2000's Brave New World(not coincidentally it was also their last masterpiece for twelve years as well). Smith plus lead singer Bruce Dickinson, bass player Steve Harris, guitarist Dave Murray and drummer Nicko McBrain made certain that Adrian's last album with Maiden for over a decade was also arguably the band's best album as I found out when I got the Capitol Record cassette version in May of 1988 and later the remastered CD. Seventh Son of a Seventh Son was Maiden's first concept album about a cursed child who is born with special powers and it tempted by the side of both good and evil. Also, the band was starting to become more progressive sounding as their music was reminiscent to that of ELP, Genesis, Pink Floyd and so forth with the tempo changes and lyric-wise. We begin the album with Moonchild which begins as an acoustic passage giving this album's theme and then it builds into a superb rocker penned by Smith and Dickinson. Next is the superb Infinite Dreams penned by Harris and was a great progressive rocker alternating between quiet and heavy and light and dark sections. Next was the album's biggest hit Can I Play With Madness penned by Smith/Harris/Dickinson which sounded reminiscent to the previous album, 1986's Somewhere in Time's biggest hit, Wasted Years. Next is The Evil That Men Do also penned by Harris/Smith/Dickinson and is another stellar rocker. This song was always one of my favorites. The album's second half begins with the epic length title cut! Like the 13 plus minute Rime Of The Ancient Mariner and 9 minute Alexander The Great before it, it is the longest and best track on the album. Unlike those two aforementioned epics, the Harris penned title cut was the band's first 10 minute track which they created the story themselves. Wonderful musicianship throughout, especially Murray and Smith's guitar duels at the end which is an awesome piece of music. The Prophecy is next and is a great track penned by Murray/Harris and ends with a superb acoustic guitar section. next is the album's third single The Clairvoyant which is another great rocker. We end the album with arguably one of Maiden's best album closers Only The Good Die Young. This Harris/Dickinson penned piece is a killer rocker. Then when you think the album ended after the big finish, the album ends with a reprise of the acoustic passage that started Moonchild.  Seventh Son of a Seventh Son was another Top 20 charting US million seller and it was because the material was strong, the production was killer and because it was Iron Maiden! RECOMMENDED"
2,"Well, I gave this CD its first spin after a two year absence of ANY Ricky Martin music in my life. After his 1999 self-title CD, I pretty much went head over heals for Ricky. When this CD came out in November of 2000 I was really excited. Upon first listening to it, I thought it was better than his 99 CD but no where near as good as Vuelve. It would take 2003's Almas Del Silencio to really wash way the bad taste in my mouth that this CD leaves.   As several folks know, Ricky was under pressure from his managers, producers and the record company to deliver a follow up to his 1999 CD. Sound Loaded is what we got. This album was obviously rushed and it sounds like it. Weak lyrics and over saturation of musical gimicks is utilzed to keep the 'Livin La Vida Loca' fever burning. Ricky's voice just sounds tired and worn out. It's easy to tell that he was way over due for a vacation.   There are a few standout tracks on the disc. 'Amor' by far out shines every song by a mile. Had Sound Loaded had more great tunes like 'Amor' on it, the CD would have been a hit. As it is, the CD is mediocre at best."
1,"This is authentic, classic, timeless poo. hot and fresh from the gut!!!"
5,"This is a hard swinging Blue Note session from the late 50's. It features a classic line up of Clark on piano, John Coltrane on tenor, Curtis Fuller on trombone, Donald Byrd on trumpet, Paul Chambers on bass, and Art Taylor  on drums. All of the artists are comfortable in the session and no one  musician dominates the set. The selections are arranged as to give everyone  room to stretch and explore the collection of standards and Clark  originals. Sonny's light, nimble touch is on display throughout the  session. His solos are well worth listening to several times and swing on  each track. Curtis Fuller has a warm, tender solo on the standard Come Rain  Or Come Shine, and Coltrane shines on Speak Low. Everyone gets room to blow  on the uptempo opening track, With a Song in My Heart, with Byrd's bright  brassy trumpet leading the way. Finally, Clark's compositional skills shine  thru on the classic that closes the set, News For Lulu. This is another  great Blue Note &quot;Connoisseur&quot; reissue of a &quot;lost  classic&quot;, it gets one star automatically for putting all of the  alternates at the end of the album instead of stringing them behind the  master takes. I recommend this set as a classic straight ahead swinging  hard bop date, especially to fans of the &quot;Blue Note sound&quot"
5,"This containes some of Greg Brown's finest writing, it is however different from his most of his other recordings. This is a dark look at American culture without being melodramatic. I purchased this one after adding one of his finest efforts &quot;The Poet Game&quot; to my collection, and I find lyrically to be amongst his best work. Highlights include 3 unique tracks &quot;The Monkey&quot;, &quot;One Cool Remove&quot;, and &quot;America Will Eat You&quot;. Other Greg Brown albums that I purchased after this one (quite a few) although they were great, did not quite rate as high on my list"
5,I am very pleased with this CD and I received it quickly. Recommend this seller highly.
5,My favourite group of music makers ever.. The album did not dissappoint.. thank you Amazo
5,"I have seen many anime's and this one has a really good soundtrack for the Hack Liminality anime's.  This is for there ps2 game series.  Even though the game+anime isn't available in the us this is a soundtrack to buy.  Comes with some techno, and great choir soundtracks in latin I thin"
1,"I purchased this after reading the reviews, I was surprised when I received it.  Hated it, I found it quite disturbing to listen to"
5,"It seems that many want to place Kim Richey in a box and she just doesn't seem to fit in one.  Like Shawn Colvin, she is someone who just has her own category.  This is actually my favorite of all the Kim Richey I own, followed by ""Bitter Sweet"" and ""Rise"".  My favorite song on ""Glimmer"" is ""Didn't I"" and the title song is great as well.  Give this one a try and enjoy."
5,"I got this yesterday for Christmas after hearing the song, "" You Set Me Free"" used on the Ice Princess Soundtrack, and i love it! Well, most of it. Here's my review of The Spirit Room.  1. Everywhere- 9/10- A fun and upbeat song. Pretty good, love the intro to it.   2. You Get Me- 5/10- It's pretty, but just too slow to me. Maybe it'll grow on me eventually.   3. All You Wanted- 10/10- The BEST on the album. Love it! Was this a single? If not, it definalty should have been.   4. You Set Me Free- 10/10- Like i already wrote, I got this CD after hearing this song on Ice Princess. Really good and fun to sing to.   5. Something to Sleep To- 7/10- OK. You should listen to it if you want to go to sleep. I still think it's OK.  6. Here With Me- 9/10- Love the beginning and the chorus. It seems like a really good song for a party.  7. Sweet Misery- 6/10- OK also. I just don't really like how the chorus is and it's too short.  8. If Only She Knew- 10/10- Fun and cool. One of my favorites.   9. I'd Rather Be in Love- 7/10- Sounds alot like Sweet Misery.  10. Goodbye to You- 8/10- This is a really pretty song about moving on in life.  11. Drop in the OCean- I don't really get this song. I'm not going to rate it.  Overall, this CD gets an A. It's pretty good. I think you should buy it"
4,Awesome! A classic Faith No More Album. It will blow you away. Supreme war  pigs cover showing just how heavy FNM can be. Even sports a little comic  relief by doing a New kids on the block tun
2,"Once again Ultra records has put it's trust into New York DJ's, and the results are not pleasing.  Disc one mixed by Vic Latino from NYC is good enough for radio (stick to KTU) but not for the higher standards set by the UK DJ's who are always well ahead of the game. Bad song choices and even worse mix choices make Disc 1 a failure.   Disc 2 mixed by The Riddler, also a NYC DJ is a vast improvment and he should be commended on his effort and this just proves not all DJ's from NYC are all bad. Better song choices here more on the Trance side but with enough vocal power to keep you moving. This Disc will be the one you play the most.  But for the money it's still a deal. I've liked Ultra's Trance CD's alot better, but if your looking for real club music stay with a proven winner and check out Ministry Of Sound, you can't go wrong with any of their CD'"
1,"I was excited when I heard about this.  Sorry, I can't handle it.  Bare, buddy, you should stay in retirement if this is going to be the result of your new efforts"
1,"Proof a hot chick with a decent voice can destroy a synth-pop hit from a better era of music. Though it's really the sound of the music that is lacking in Gwen's version, so I can't blame her for the disaster.  The original still rules"
1,"This is a horrible CD!  It was like nails on a chalkboard listening to it then I finally had enough and took it out of my player and threw it away.  There may have been 3 songs on this CD that were actually OK, but the rest of it were these obscure songs that came from under a rock somewhere. "
5,"2day i just ordered this cd from barns and noble! cant wait til it comes in! i love the songs surrender and all night long! i also recomend the fallowing cds and artists,everytime we touch by cascada,a fever you cant sweat out by panic! at the disco,1on 1 by rupee,decemberunderground by afi,greatest hits by ace of base,flyleaf by flyleaf,sound advice by shapeshifters,and end of gray by decyfer down! buy them all"
2,"Most of these songs are classic, but the disc is too short for it's own good. Clocking in at 35:48 with only 12 songs. Ouch! Well, I guess you can look at it like an old 33 1/3 rpm. Just hit the pause button after track 6. Take a deep breath or go to the bathroom or fix a drink. Then hit the play button.  But seriously, there are so many countless trinkets missing from a collection called, ""20th Century Masters: The Best of the Andrews Sisters, The Millennium Collection,"" wow, that's a bit long winded. But, with a title like that you ought to have Rhumboogie, Beer Barrel Polka, Well Alright, Straighten Up And Fly Right, Rumors Are Flying, etc. Don't get me wrong, it's a nice introduction but just too short.   Buyer beware!  Finally, why can't these compilations of old 78's have a few more seconds between them? Essentially we have a bunch of singles all crammed together, so why not let them have some breathing room. As I recall, the UK Beatles albums from 1963-1966 had a seven second break between songs. I loved it! It was like giving each song it's own spotlight. Oh, the days of one song at a time."
1,"YO THIS JOINT IS WACK. ITS A WASTE OF TIME I DON'T WHY I BROUGHT IT. YOUR BEST BET IS TO WAIT FOR LIL WEEZEE TO DROP HIS NEXT ALBUM. HE IS CASH MONEY NOW. SINCE JUVE HAS LEFT MAYBE THE REST OF THE HOT BOYS SHOULD CONSIDER IT TOO MICKEY AND LAC ARE JUST PLAIN WACK. MANNIE FRESH HAS BEEN SURPASSED BY THE LIKES OF TIMBERLAND, NEPTUNES,TRACK MASTERS HIS BEATS JUST CAN'T COMPETE ANYMORE. CASH MONEY SHOULD LOOK INTO LETTING SOMEONE ELSE DO THEIR TRACKS INSTEAD OF MANNIE DOING THE WHOLE ALBUM BECAUSE HE HAS LOST HIS TOUCH"
5,"I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE I WAS TRYING EXPAND MY HORIZONS, YOU KNOW? CULTURALLY AND MENTALLY, YOU KNOW? SERIOUSLY THOUGH I WAS IN THE SHOP AND I WAS HAVING A GAZE AROUND THE PLACE AND THEN THIS PICTURE JUST JUMPS OUT AT ME, AND I PICKED IT UP AND IT WAS THIS DEBUSSY CHAP AND ID HEARD ABOUT HIM ON THE BBC LEARNING ZONE SO I THOUGHT ;why not?; SERIOUSLY THOUGH I DRAGGED IT HOME AND I POPPED IT IN THE OLD CD PLAYER AND IT FLOORED ME.......I MEAN SERIOUSLY THIS THING...AMAAZING STUFF..I MEAN TODAYS MUSIC HAS NOTHING, NOTHING NOTHING ON THIS STUFF RIGHT HERE.   SOME GOOD TRACKS ARE: TRACK 1 IS THE BEST. THE OPENING FLUTE ON THE TRACK IS TOTALLY CHILLED AND COOL, REMINDS ME A BIT OF TRACK 13 ON ILL COMMUNICATION BY THE BEASTIE BOYS...A COINCIDENCE???  THE ONLY WEAK TRACK ON THE ALBUM IS TRACK 6, THE UNFORTUNATELY TITLED ""CHILDRENS CORNER SUITE: GOLLIWOGGS CAKE WALK"" THE MUSIC IS JUST DATED MAN, JUST AS DATED AS THE TITLE.  OVERALL THOUGH THIS IS A QUALITY ALBUM, WITH CHILLS, SPILLS AND THRILLS. SERIOUSLY THOUGH A FINE EFFORT"
4,"This 1973 follow up to the Wailers debut `Catch A Fire' is mainly a collection of updated singles that had been doing the rounds on the Jamaican underground scene for years. `Get Up, Stand Up' and `I Shot The Sheriff' are two of the most hitting cuts the Wailers ever recorded, but the rest of the material doesn't have the same mass appeal of their other albums. This is more an album for hardcore fans of reggae than the general audience. It's a cool set but `Burnin' isn't an album I can bump too much"
4,"This CD contains both studio re-recordings of earlier works (""Judas"", ""Dandelion"", ""Anna"", etc.) as well as new songs.  I have some sympathy for Ben Fassett's earlier comment.  Those who have heard Antje Duvekot's earlier works (""Little Peppermints"" and ""Boys, Flowers, Miles"") may be surprised by her sound in this CD.   I was fortunate enough to hear her live in concert the other night, and was completely impressed by her presence and performance.  Her earlier CDs convey the power of her solo performance; think Patty Griffin's ""Living with Ghosts"" as a comparable example.  Paradoxically, less is more.    This CD, on the other hand, adds string arrangements and other instruments to her voice and guitar.  I think that some of the raw emotion and poignancy can get lost in the production, and her voice can occasionally be muted.  In her concert, she performed some of the new songs from this CD, and they were very much in the style of her earlier CDs.  The earlier CDs also reveal her live demeanor which is quite shy, humorous and self-deprecating.  You should really try to see her in person if you have a chance.  On the other hand, this CD represents more Antje Duvekot, and that is never a bad thing.  It is still well worth the purchase, but consider also ""Boys, Flowers, Miles"" to hear the power of her solo voice"
5,I've already listened to samples of her new CD.Its even better than her first one!!! More rock in it! anyways this is an amazing debut album.I love it the way to begin and anticonformity are the best songs on the CD
4,"I'm reviewing this to raise the avg. star rating.  I think this is a decent piece of work that is not intended to be listened to in one sitting.  The songs are kinda slow grooves that remind me a lot of Traffic at times; funk keyboards wash over the whole thing and the vocals are almost inaudible whispers.  I'm not sure what place this kind of music holds in the industry, in society, among fellow musicians.  I only know that it doesn't deserve a three star avg, though it all kind feels like one big song, it's a real cool, groovy song"
5,"I don't understand what the previous &quot;reviewer&quot; was talking about, that miles was playing it square here. This is a beautiful, relaxed album, and one of the only quartet recordings miles did. Plus, he plays the  open trumpet on every tune. He made this album when he was waking up from  his blue haze of heroin addiction, right before he went on to huge fame and  success and you can hear all his new ideas formulating on this record.  However, if you're only accustomed to later Miles Davis records where he  was fueled by fiery tenormen like Shorter and Coltrane, then maybe it might  sound too laid back for you. I dunno"
2,"In many ways a relic of its era, ""Not of This Earth"" is the first widely distributed release by Joe Satriani (a previous EP ended up being reissued as part of ""Time Machine"", years later).  The guitarist, supported by drummer Jeff Campitelli and percussionist John Cuniberti came into public attention when Steve Vai, a former student of Satriani, ended up singing his teacher's praises in the music press.  The result is that this album, more than likely to have been lost in the shuffle of instrumental rock music, received wider recognition and poised Satriani to explode into a bonafide celebrity on his next record.  The album itself is a bit uneven-- Satriani is a flawlessly brilliant guitarist, but as a songwriter, he wasn't quite ready.  Several pieces (""Not of This Earth"", ""Hordes of Locusts"") seem to run out of steam before they end, and a couple (""The Snake"", ""Driving At Night"") feel like bad '80s metal.  On the other hand, several pieces shine-- delicate and lovely ""Rubina"", reggaeish and emotionally soaked ""Memories"", and the overtly Frippesque ""New Day"" are all fine examples of what Satriani is capable of.  But my favorite is probably ""Brother John"", where Satriani abandons all his effects and performs his delicate and bubbly melody cleantone.  In the end, the album is ok, but Satriani would go on to do so much more interesting in the future.  Come back to this one if you've picked up a bunch of other stuff and are looking for more, but most should start with ""Surfing With the Alien"""
1,"so i really liked new nathan detroits...i kept listening, hoping for more.  what i got was a listless drone of alternative sounding chords and alkaline trio style vocals.  i suppose i didnt give the album much of a chance... but when i have to stop listening to it twice because it bores me so much, i dont feel like i need to.  the album appeared to have potential...but nothing stuck out except for the first track.  everything just ran together, and it was difficult to seperate any sort of melody in any of the songs.  compared to all the other reviews, i am apparently missing something, but i didnt like it.  i heard it directly after listening to appleseed casts' &quot;end of the ring wars&quot;, which was amazing.  so i guess would recomend that over this anyday.  i will give this album another chance, simply because everyone else seems to like it so much, but as for right now, it gets a big juicy thumbs down"
5,Normaly this isn't my type of music but he is so great at it I had to buy i
5,"I have good instincts, folks.  Just like all of you who've already givin' this a glowing review.  I checked this out from the library a few days ago and was immediately FLOORED.  So much so that I'm thinking about not reteurning it; telling them I lost it an' just paying for it.  I'm amazed at the gracefulness that comes across when you put together two so distinct an' so DIFFERENT voices.  Louis' scratchy, gruff, yet likeable an' melodic croon an' Ella's smooth-as-silk, soothing an' intoxicating voice incredibly, to me, go PERFECTLY on these duets here.  From that first opener 'Let's Call the Whole Thing off', done so sly an' flirtatious on both parts, to 'Gee, Baby, Ain't I Good to You' to the ever-engaging 'Autumn in New York' and 'Stars Fell on Alabama' one of the GREATEST standards EVER written (""And in the center just you and me, My heart beat like a hammer, My arms wound around you tight, And stars fell on Alabama last night"").  THAT is what romance is, kiddies!  Oh, an' I can't forget 'Summertime'.  Ahhh, yes, 'Summertime', with that opening trumpet that tugs at your heart strings and makes you wish for days of love, happiness, sunlights an' flowers; a world of beauty that should never be taken for granted.  Yeah, I know what you're thinkin'; ""there he goes, layin' it on thick again.""  Well, I can't help it.  In a time filled with the most repugnant excuses for music I've ever heard in all my soon-to-be twenty-five years, it is a shining gift that this music has been preserved for us who TRULY appreciate talent and genius.  There's no show-boating here, no bone-headed braggadocio, no studio gimmicks.  THIS is what music is. "
2,"If you're a fan of either ""Holiday Inn"" or ""White Christmas"" you really, really should avoid this one.  Its recording quality not only offers substandard ""tin can"" sound, but you won't find Rosemary Clooney on a single track from White Christmas.    This is not a soundtrack.  It's a studio version of songs that sound familiar from the movies but were not performed this way on screen.  Disappointing to say the least, as me and mine are avid fans of these Christmas-themed films.  The two stars I've placed here are generous, but I couldn't move down to one ... ""hate"" doesn't fit.  I am, however, not keeping this CD.  Too depressing and not at all what I hoped to hear.  If you're a true fan of the films, these recordings won't be what you hope to hear, either.  Good luck in finding the real thing! "
4,"This band is a great pick-up, especially if you like bands like Shinedown or Tantric.  At times, I wish there was more guitar parts on the album, but its a very solid, safe, and well produced release.  nothing ground breaking, but a great listen that will be in my changer for weeks to come"
5,"This is in my opinion the best performace from Anders. He mixes his higher pitched vocals found prominatly on the newer albums with the classic Melo Death vocals found on earlier albums. There is also some low talking thrown in a few songs, Bullet Ride being one of them. Musically, while its not their best, it is very good. Similar to the vocals they mix old and new sound on this CD to create a masterpiece. Pounding and yet melodic guitar work is the In Flames trademark. Also, Daniel's drumming on this album is probably his finest hour, a standout for him being Brush the Dust Away.  Stand out tracks overall are:  Bullet Ride Pinball Map Square Nothing Brush the Dust Away  All the songs on here are awesome those are just my favorites. This is a good CD for newcomers because it isnt too much like the old or new and its a great mix.  All in all, this is not only one of my favorite CDs from In Flames, but all time as well"
1,"I am a huge Mars fan, but this is just bore.  I was really looking forward to a cd representive of their live shows, but this is a horrible excuse for a live album from anyone especially from Mars Volta. I am all for experimentation, but if you look at the liner notes there are a ton of non-band members jerkin' off on this after the original recording and personally coming from a recording and engineering backround it is not creative or good.  It seems like a bad painting. Save your money and buy bootleg of their actual live show."
5,Who knows how different the history of music as we know it would be like without this genius.  Every blues musician since and many classic rock bands owe him a huge debt.  This is a must for any music collection
5,"This is a finely crafted album, it's just beautiful. Background harmonies from Dolly Parton, Emmylou Harris, Ricky Skaggs, Vince Gill, Amy Grant, Trisha Yearwood.... Patty is fantastic on her own, but with these voices blended in, something special was created."
5,"Some artists are good enough that to label one work as their best says more than a lot.  Nick Cave is by all means one of them.  And 'Your Funeral...My Trial' is that golden release.  Beginning with the slow title cut, it moves it's way through track after track, sometimes menacing, sometimes violent, sometimes beautiful, and always thought provoking and dark.  Highlights?  Honestly, all of them.  Warning, this album is Nick's least accesable and that says a lot too.  But after a few good listens, it works it's way into your brain and it's the best thing since ever- I promise"
5,"This 16-song compilation of western swing includes: San Antonio Rose, Lilly Dale, Texas Two Step, and Big Ball in Cowtown.  http://www.cowgirls.com EN"
2,By far nothing comparable to Javier Solis. Not taking anything away from the tenor of OPERA not Ranchera...Lets leave the rancheras for those who are gifted in its style.  You want real rancheras listen to MR. Javier Solis
2,"A giant leap back from Love.Angel.Music.Baby. What was she thinking with this album? This music does not compare at all to L.A.M.B. and her No Doubt days. 'The Sweet Escape' (song) is very successful on the charts, ...and I honestly don't understand why. It's so generic and 'woo hoo' part is so annoying. The album is a one star but I'll give her two because I still love Gwen"
5,"This is the last really good album that Lou Reed made in 1990. He captures the feel of his New York and you can visualise what the Dirty Boulevard looks like. Lou is at his best when he plays tough and on New York his hard edged urban lyrics really hit the spot. For Velvet's fans, im going to rate this 3rd of Lou's solo efforts behind Transformer and Take No Prisoners"
1,"Now usually if I know 100% that something is wack, I won't waste my money on it and can just download it for free. Now I wish that I didn't even do that at all. A lot of reviewers seem to have faced the facts: Paris CANNOT SING! This here has proven that clearly. Now that I think about it, what can she do?...other than being a rich [female] who keep her name in the news (That ""E!"" channel if anyone actually watches that) on something stupid. Now on to this. There is no other explaimation to it except that it sucks. The original song sucks, and the four remixes are even worse, not to mention that some of them are pretty long in length. But lets face the facts; despite many 1 or 2 star reviews, bull [...] music is going to sell. True, if the rap group Dead 4 Life can have a high selling single ""Laffy Taffy"" and have their album go gold, there is no telling for what numbers Paris Hilton will put up, just because it's her. Easily one of the worst songs I've heard in the past 5 years.   Take my advice: There is halfassed talent out there that is better than this. Also $18 is too much to have something to sit your drinks on. And if this is imported, it should have been confiscated when trying to get through U.S. customs. It's THAT bad!  When songs like this see the light of day, you know that shes doing whatever she can to stay relevant.  Lyrics: F Production: D- Musical Vibes: "
1,"This band has potential but has zero groove, nothing to latch onto at all. Go see the Sword and leave early, man"
5,"Great price, fast delivery, CD in excellent condition!  What more could you ask for??!"
5,"Michael Hoppe is a treasure. From his earliest recordings until his latest, Requiem, I have never been disappointed. Solace does not have one track that you will skip over. The soloists, where there are vocals, are superb and speak straight to the heart. Occasionally we are given a musical gift that lasts us a lifetime. This is one of those gifts. Therese Tappouni  Writer, Workshop Director, author of A Time to Reap and Walking Your Walk, a Woman's Guide to a Spirit Filled Life"
2,"Save your money unless YOU TRULY ARE A FAN OF CHICAGO! The only tracks I listen to are HARD HABIT TO BREAK and IF YOU'RE LEAVING NOW. The other tracks really didn't do anything for me. I would say that a more complete volume of ""best of"" would probably be a better choice"
1,"Yeah, man. I used to be like really stupid. I got bad grades in school. But then I started listening to Modest Mouse's music and I was like, ""whoa!"" and now I'm really smart, and no one is smarter than me in my whole school, including the teachers! They should market ""Lonesome Crowded West"" on TV as a way to get kids to do better in school, because it makes you intelligent. It's a scientific fact! All you people who give this album a negative review whould go and listen again, because some times you have to listen more than once. And if you still don't get it after like 30 listens, then listen 30 more, because listening that much to a rock and roll band is in no way pathetic. Besides, being a Modest Mouse fan makes you a card carrying member of the special club, where you get to talk about Modest Mouse and the sophistication and about how Isaac Brock's childhood was so tragic and nothing like that has ever happened to anyone else and how now he's my god and astrology and Modest Mouse chatrooms and Modest Mouse T-Shirts and Modest Mouse CDs and books off the Modest Mouse website and how horrible capitalism is. Don't you wanna be a member of the club?   This CD has changed my life completely. I used to have no friends and I spent a lot of time in my parent's basement. And now.... well, I still don't have friends and I live in my parent's basement, but the people online understand that I ""get"" how Modest Mouse's music is an excellent replacement for the voids in my life that otherwise would have been filled with girlfriends and thinking (yuch!!!!!!!!!!!). And that one song where Isaac says, ""My thoughts weren't so loud"" is like, so true, because we live in a democracy which just let's the man hold Isaac back. What we need to do is set up socialism, with Isaac at the top and he'll provide for the rest of us and we never have to get jobs because he's so talented. He's like, outgrown his fans, too. Except me. Like, some days, I listen to ""This is a Long Drive for Someone With Nothing to Think About"" which is an awesome title because it's so long it's like a sentence and I'm so cool and smart because I get that. Well, I didn't really get that on my own, but I was the one who pushed the buttons while I was on the internet, in between visits to the Modest Mouse messageboard of course. But some days, I listen to the album and cry out in wonder at the height of my sophistication for listening and enjoying such a unique group, and I feel so accomplished and brilliant and that isn't a waste of a day at all. And then I go onto another album, like ""The Moon and Antarctica"" (I didn't even know you could seen the moon from down there!!!!!!!) and I link all the geographcial and astronomical references and I learn a lot that week. And then I listen to that bootleg I got and then the DVD I got off ebay from another guy who ""gets Modest Mouse"" and suddenly I've spent a year putting all these things together from the lyrics and I'm like ""Whoa, I thought I was smart before, but now I'm REALLY smart,"" you know, because I've spent so much time listening to Modest Mouse and talking about Modest Mouse on the internet, and suddenly it's been, like five years, which is perfect because that's how often my gods put out an album. It's odd I haven't realized yet that I've completely dedicated myself to a ROCK BAND and all my money, opportunity, and life have been paid over to Modest Mouse. It's just a good thing that I think for myself and that I'm so different from all the other Modest Mouse fans that do the exact same thing I do. Yep, good thing.   j5w2k9@hotmail.com"
1,"This Was Joe Walsh in his Prime, when he was really Rockin' If your A james Gang fan, and you like live music, you really should own this ""CD""!  (Joe at some of his best!!!)"
1,Thousand Foot Krutch suck in my opinion.  I bought this CD hoping to find a good band but I found a band I really do not like.  It is just not the type of music I like to listen too.  But it is not good to always base your opinion on people who may not like the same music as you so you should try it out and give it a try i really just dont like it
4,"For those who need their music to be deep and thought provoking, then maybe this album isn't for you. For those who just want good melodic pop songs that crawl inside your head, then this is definitely for you. I play it from beginning to end without skipping a song. Also contains Deperate Fools which ranks among my all-time Carmen favorites. Unlike most other solo material, there is a hint of disco in a few of the songs. In my opinion, 8 of these songs are B+ with the final cut an A+"
2,"I grew enamored with Eric Carmen's music, drawn in by not only the many honest, complicated emotions of his first two solo albums (especially Boats Against The Current) but also by the occasionally hard-hitting pop of The Raspberries.  I got away from Carmen's work for a long time, but recently have been relistening to the old LP's and gave Change of Heart a spin.  After hearing it again, I was surprised at three things.  First, most songs seemed half-baked, with the chorus on most making a quick appearance and then repeating endlessly.  These are short songs, devoid of development and any compositional reach.  Second, the production seemed both overdone and timid at the same time.  Overdone in the all-star backing musicians (Danny Kortchmar! Leland Sklar!  Nigel Olsson!  Burton Cummings!  Jeff Porcaro!) playing very simple stuff.  Overdone in the too-thick orchestration.  Timid like the hand claps and piano glissandos on ""Hey Deanie"" and other examples throughout the album.  Finally, I was surprised by the brevity.  Only 8 tunes, with a syrupy orchestral variation on the title track.  Again, underlining the overall theme of an uninspired, tired work"
2,"I thought the album was boring.  I didn't watch Nashville Star but I'm a big country music fan and I like to listen to new artists.  I bought the cd and loved the catchy song ""I Break Things"".  The other songs really didn't grab me, even after several listens.  I was disappointed in her cover of ""I'm Not Lisa""- although Erika Jo has a beautiful voice, I found the rendition lacking emotion.  She's a good singer but I hope her next album has some better material"
5,"I heard about these guys from that movie, Dig!, and I didn't know what to expect. Turns out, they're amazing. There's no comparison to the Dandy Warhols, none. Why they thought they were in competition with a hack band with a few hooks is beyond me. These guys are the real deal. If it wasn't for their lead singer making a jerk of himself and screwing up record deals (which is a storyline that you won't understand once you hear the thoughtful lyrics), these guys would be widely known as one of the best bands in the world. They sound like a throwback from the 60's, but slightly updated. The music is varied and intelligent as anything you've heard. I guess The Rolling Stones might be an apt comparison, but there's something more raw about this band. Look, if you were on the fence, just buy this, you won't be disappointed"
5,"It has been roughly one year since this album was released. As of today, I still find myself listening to it regularly, as this cd just has classic written all over it. The opening pair of songs are  nothing more than tastes of what is in store for the listener.  Queens of the Stone Age may not have Nick Oliveri in it, but you can tell that this cd still kicks. All of the elements fall into play, creating a cohesive piece of music that captures your mind. You will find yourself rocking out with Medication and Someone's in the Wolf. You may find yourself singing along to the singles Little Sister and In my Head. You may find yourself lamenting to Long Slow Goodbye and I Never Came. In fact, there is not one bad track on this album.  This one can be considered an overview of the band's output from their inceptiion to today, as most of the songs sound like they could be from another album. That is why this one is amazing. It is definitely Queens. It has the stoner grove from the first record, the pop elements from the second and the heavy parts from the previous effort. It also hints at what's in storage for us fans in the future.  Lullabies is utterly amazing. The high quality of the songs, as well as the tendency for you to hit the repeat button suggest this one to be a modern classic. It is the kind of cd that our kids will be listening to in about 20 years. Do yourself a favor. Pick it up. NOW"
5,"Back in the 40's and 50's (even the 30's going back to Milton Brown and Bob)Western Swing was in a class all it's own. Either you loved it or not,in most cases there was no inbetween. Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys swore to Great Fame as did Bob's steel player Leon. Milton Brown who started it all would of ruled the roost if not for his early death in the late 30's. Spade Cooley was a real favorite even had a TV show and at one time was bigger then them all except he ended up doing time for a murder rap. He was the first to coin the phrase ""Western Swing"". Over the years there were many others like Curly Williams,Tex Williams,Elton Brittand Pee Wee King to name a few.But when I want to hear some of the finest Swing music from who I believe to be the Greastest Western Swing song writer as well as artist there is only one choice,""Hank Penny and his Radio Cowboys"". Hank is about the most under rated Country and Western artist ever to go on the stage. His music is second to none and his lyrics can stop a coon in it's tracks! If you want to really get the best music that Hank ever put out it is essential to get this CD""Crazy Rhytm"" along with his 2CD set ""King of Hillbilly Bebop"". Both of these sets will open a whole new world of Western Swing to any listener. If you never heard of Hank Penny or heard his music you are in for a treat. His lead female singer was the great Jaye P. Morgan who had great fame in the 50's and 60's as a crooner. I admit that this music is not for everyone and i would bet that only about 10% of todays so called Country Music enthusiasts will apperciate this goldmine of classics. Hits like ""Flamin'Mamie"" and ""Peroxide Blond"" are some of the best ""Hillbilly"" music that will ever be recorded. ""Wide Open Spaces"" and ""Little Red Wagon"" are classics that only Hank could pull off.This is the real thing if your love of music is like mine (my wife has adopted ""Western Swing""as one of her favorite sounds also). Again please keep in mind if your idea of Country Music is watching some half baked,half naked, B-girl, bimbo on a perverted modern video that they now show on TV singing worthless songs that sound no more Country then Perry Como ,but just like pop hits from the 70's then this classic music ain't for you,believe me it ain't. If your idea of enjoying music is sitting back and listening to Ernest Tubb singing ""I'm like Driftwood on the River of Regret"" then I'm certain you will dig Hank!                              ""Enjoy"" Joe Kopec"
1,"Let me start by saying that I thought that Atmosphere's early albums were much better(Most of Atmosphere's current fans have no idea that they had other albums...)But Seven's Travels is Slug and Ant's transformation into a crappy sell-out group, and the first ever emo-rap group. The people that love this album are always some teenager, usually some emo-kid, who decide they like rap and Atmosphere after hearing this album. They jump onto the official Atmosphere bandwagon, but dont think that they listen to rap...they listen to ""rap"". These emo-rap kids love to talk about how much mainstream rap sucks and how much better Atmosphere is, and how underground is the best. (Dont think from this that I am a fan of mainstream rap, i'm just explaining)The number one sign you can tell from, even by just looking at these reviews, is if they start talking about how mainstream sucks(Naturally, these teenage kids like to be different, and can't stop talking about it)or how this is real true rap music. So, basically, these kids are part of the underground hip-hop backpacking club who love the only Atmosphere album they've ever heard, Sevens Travels and live out their little emo lives listening to Atmosphere(for about 3 months). Even if these people listen to Atmosphere's other albums ( which would totally make them the ultimate Atmosphere super-fan!)it makes no difference because Atmosphere is a crappy emo-rap group now. The purpose of this is to inform people that listen to real hip-hop that this album is not for them and that its for  emotionally-disturbed teenagers. Go buy some real hip-hop, and we can all let the emo-kids cry themselves to sleep listening to Sevens Travels"
5,"This year for our church Christmas concert, we are doing a collection of Michael W. Smith's Christmas music.  To my delight, two of the songs - Emmanuel and Christmas Hymn - were ones I fell in love with twenty years ago while listening to this collection on cassette.  Warm and bright, and still as fresh now as it was in the early 80's, this is still one of my favorite Amy Grant albums AND one of my favorite Christmas albums"
4,"I didn't find this CD to be as fabulous as careless love but, still enjoy it"
5,"My favourite performance of this classic Gilbert & Sullivan Operetta. Kevin Kline, Linda Ronstat, and the whole cast are perfect"
1,"I can't imagine why Mr. Andriessen's new opera Writing to Vermeer is garnering so much praise -- maybe ""you had to be there."" On CD, however, it's a grating, annoying, and self-consciously postmodern trial to endure... in fact, I finally had to just give up about halfway through the second disc. Life is too short, after all."
5,"As I said just above, this is a prime example of what I like to call Audio Art. From the dynamio begginning to the story song ending it is a great album through and through. It is more electric then their debut release but it's a welcomed change. Not that the debut was bad. The songs tell tales of broken hearts and the story song carries along a nice message of anti-suicide which is a welcome break from other bands out there.  I give it five stars because the music flows together so well, the quality is magnificent and the whole album is so through out and well laid that it deserves nothing less"
2,"Following up a critically acclaimed debut is probably one of the hardest things that an artist can do, and more often than not, the album falls well short of expectations, because they're so highly elevated.  ""Whip-Smart"" is a decent, albeit somewhat inconsistent album, but its pales in comparison to ""Exile in Guyville"", and that unfortunately is how it will always be thought.  Probably the most important thing about ""Whip-Smart"" is that its not Exile Part 2, while some songs maintain that sort of lo-fi sound/overt lyric gig that the previous record got so much mileage from (""X-Ray Man"", ""Crater Lake""), the album actually does best when it drifts further away from the territory of Exile-- from the noise guitar over the familiar melody of ""Chopsticks"" to the haunting, moody, ""Shane', where the tension is almost palpable to the brilliant, chugging ""Jealousy"".  Like Exile, it excels when the tension is at its highest, unlike Exile, its a lot brighter sounding.  Still, for all the good stuff on here, it sounds like Phair wasn't quite ready to issue a followup.  Several experiments in different veins sound incomplete (""Alice Springs""), fall apart (""Support System"", ""Go West"") or are plain irritating (""Cinco de Mayo"", ""May Queen"").  Its got its moments, but ""Whip-Smart"" is largely disposable-- start with Phair's debut, ""Exile in Guyville"", its everything its regarded as"
1,"I have to admit, like others, I bought this CD just because I was excited to have another collection of Three Dog Night songs.  I was so disappointed when I played it and realized it was really only two dogs.  Without Chuck, there is no Three Dog Night.  They can package it the same way, call it by the same name, but it's not.  These vocals are nothing more than lack luster covers of the originals, certainly not the wonderful vocals we have come to know and love.  I agree with another reviewer here...why can't they listen to the words of ""Easy to be Hard"" and patch things up?  If the Eagles can do it, the Dogs should be able to as well.  Eager fans are waiting for some new harmony!  Oh yeah, and this CD, I threw it away"
4,"I KID YOU NOT!..he ghost wrote 7 of the 15 tracks on private times for Al B. Sure..ask yourself this question: how come you never actually saw a picture of Kyle West?...Hmm?  Overall,a really good album.i wouldn't recommend buying the first one but this one i do :) "
5,"This is Bob Dylan at his very finest and this is probably his best record, from ""Like a Rolling Stone"" to the album's closer, ""Desolation Row,"" the listener is assaulted with blistering images in rhyme that she will never forget. Dylan changed the shape of the musical landscape with this record, changed rock and roll forever. His songs broke the three minute mold, they weren't about love and love lost anymore. In fact some of them are darned hard to understand, but they stay with you none the less. Bob Dylan was, and is, the poet laureate of Rock and Roll, the poet laureate of America. Love after we're all gone, his lyrics will be sung, recited, read"
4,"&quot;Two of a Mind&quot; is a studio-only project from the summer of 1962. Desmond had done a record led by Gerry several years prior, and it was Mulligan's turn to play with Paul on a project he would control. Because of heavy workloads, the two principals collaborated in three separate sessions during June, July and August in New York. Also due to scheduling difficulties, the rhythm section changed at each session. On the six tunes which made the original LP, there are three different bassists and two different drummers. Also on the six LP selections, Desmond did a little studio trickery: some of the improvised solos were put together from different sessions, and on one tune he overdubbed a third saxophone for one verse. If you didn't know this, however, you'd never guess it. The counterpoint improvs of Gerry on baritone and Paul on alto are consistently interesting. Overall the disc is more uptempo than Desmond's other work as a leader. The product lacks that special magic which can often be found on a good recording by a quartet which plays live together and often, but it is a subtle loss. This reissue adds five bonus tracks, including two with guitarist Jim Hall which did not make Desmond's final list for LP inclusion, but which are quite nice. The two leads are highly skilled, and they seemed to like each other a lot and to bring out good things for one another. Not Desmond's best work by a long shot, nor Mulligan's, but worth owning if you are partial to either man. I'm glad BMG is doing these Bluebird First Edition releases from the RCA vaults. The booklets are usually quite good. They come in cardboard cases instead of jewel cases, and I'm not sure if I like that or not yet. Maybe they  could knock a dollar or two off the price and be an even better value, but if, like me, you enjoy the classic jazz of the 1946-'66 generation, you should buy some of these reissues to encourage the company to keep them coming"
5,"I listen to a ton of trance artists in the psychadelic/goa esque genre, and I must say that I have yet to hear anything that can even remotely compare to Infected Mushroom. The originality, detail, and craftsmanship that goes into their music is quite frankly amazing. B.P. Empire is one of many amazing Infected Mushroom albums. Generally it is a bit more ambient, and on some tracks possibly a bit more somber than some of their other realeases, but never the less it is a great album. My personal favorite tracks are Noise Maker and P.G.M.. Dancing With Kadafi is a track which is more of an experimental track, which appears to be the birth of the second disc from Converting Vegetarians (which is an experimental or like IM says, &quot;other side&quot; to Infected Mushroom which is like everything else they do, incredible.). Like all Infected Mushroom albums, the quality of the production of B.P. Empire is among incredible. One of the most amazing aspects of Infected Mushroom is their ability to cleanly mix a multitude of synth and percussion sounds simultaneously and make the mix sound tight and refined, and not like a huge mess. They are quite an amazing group, and at the time are probably my favorite artist in any genre. I also find it amazing how many people that I have showed Infected Mushroom to, that don't even listen to trance, are hooked on Infected Mushroom. I highly suggest that you pick up their albums if you love trance and have an open mind. I promise you will not regret it"
1,"I like what Phil Rogers said about CETACEAN. But to me, CETACEAN doesn't sound surfadelic so much as cheezadelic. As a matter of fact, it's arguably the apotheosis of mod-a-go-go cheezpop. SUSAN doesn't impress me. I don't hear what nicjaytee hears in it.  CJ & The Fish also did a few tracks for a soundtrack called ZACARIAH. And ZACARIAH isn't included at amazon. So allow me to say something about it here. Ya know all of those song lyrics wherein the singer brags about the modesty of his needs? Well, let it be known that Barry Melton wrote a parody of that obnoxious mentality in a tune called ALL I NEED: ""All I need to have a good time is a reefer, a woman, and a bottle of wine. With those 3 things I don't need no sunshine. A reefer, a woman, and a bottle of wine. All I want is to never grow old. I want to wash in a bathtub of gold. I want 97 kilos already rolled. I want to wash in a bathtub of gold. I wanna light my cigars with 10-dollars bills. I'd like to have a cattle ranch in Beverly Hills. I'd like a bottle of red-eye that's always filled. I'd like to have a cattle ranch in Beverly Hills."
1,"I really gave this album a chance.  There were even a couple of moments where I thought that a song had a particularly good (in a cheesy way) 80's arena rock riff.  But without fail, even the songs that start out ""good"", turn into generic forgettable 80's rock -- you know the type that littered the early 80's music scene and all sounded as if it was written by some studio executive and a computer.    I guess there is no accounting for taste, and everyone can have their opinions.  Unless you are REALLY into early 80's power ballads, however, don't even think about getting this album"
2,"This album is written for people that are emotionally 16 years old and insane.  Every song is from the point of a disenfranchised boy moaning at the world.  The end of 'I'm gonna love her for both of us', when he keeps saying the title with different inflections...don't you just picture Rainman rocking in a corner somewhere?  And if she doesn't love him back, he'll kill her!  Unless she's in bed with a group of his best friends??  No wonder 'Everything is Permitted.'  This is bad.  The production is bad, the tone of the guitar is godawful, Meat's voice sounds worse on this cd than any of his others by far (I know he lost his voice and was doing weird things to try to get it back.  I don't hold it against him, but I'm the one that has to listen to it.)  The band is fine, and I like some of the actual music.  It's the song titles and lyrics that are awful"
5,"The almighty Unearth has returned to us with a brand new EP entitled Endless. Picking up right where 'The Stings Of Conscience' left off, this Massachusetts metal machine is ready to kick your teeth in once more. First of all the new material is more metal if you can believe that. The song Endless could very well be the greatest hardcore song erver written. The track kicks off with Susi and Mcgrath going absolutly ape... on their axes and Trevor spitting some of the most truthful and inspiring lyrics ever written. The track ends with one of the most monstrous breakdowns I have ever experienced. Awesome .... Internal War is an anti war song and here we witness some absolute sick skin smashing from Mike Rudberg. The pace is fast as Susi and Mcgrath lead the way accompenied by Phipps as he belts out words of truth: 'Power in the wrong hands, our scaffold is destroyed, children killing children cuz the government has ignorned, I sling my arrow to shatter your walls, no more creating victims from ignorance'. I loved The Charm, because its like an old guitar driven eighties metal tune sounding like something  Shadows Fall may write. Once again gutiars fly all over the place and Trevor sounding like a psychotic madman. This is followed with some sick breakdowns and some bad... solos. The last track My Desire also appeared on their full length. I for one do not really dig EPs, but Unearth is one of my favorite bands so I gave em a 5. If you dig any European influenced metalcore or just plain old hardcore, Unearth is the band for you, and I for one can not wait for a new full length"
5,"I never get tired of listening to this CD, and I like all of the songs on it.  His lyrics are so weird and interesting.  The music is so original. Great anywhere... in the car, cleaning the house, during a party, working out, etc"
4,"I'm always looking for good prog rock, experimental etc...whatever you want to call it. Been listerning since the late 60's early 70's to everything from Zappa, Van Der Graaf, PFM, Genesis, T-heads, Yes ....you get the drift. Bought this CD (like many others I've bought) just to try something new.  My first impression after a few tunes was...guess this ones gonna be collecting dust! But, I stuck to it and listened to the whole CD with an open mind. A lot of little things, quirky things, odd things jumped out at me...some cool melodies, guitar riffs, moments of dissonant chaos followed by structure. Music that I honestly can't say I've heard, or imagined before. Wow! This album has grown on me. I've already bought 3 more or their previous releases and am looking forward to giving in to the unusual and addicting music that is deerhoof"
2,"As much as I like most of the songs on this CD...it's just too short. Also the production is lousy.  The recording quality sounds awful in places. Hopefully, the updated compilations are better. This one is not worth the money!!!"
1,I am a big U2 fan and I don't really like this.  There are a couple really good songs on it but other than that... not for the average listener
5,"I've been listining (and singing along) to this album for yaers. It's got all the best Patsy, pure Patsy (not too overloaded with background singers). Just buy it"
1,"The first song is GREAT, but after that the album just doesNOT compare to the first one.  Sorry I bought it.  Too much SCREAMING for me. "
5,"This is the best ALbert Collins CD you can buy. The guitar playing is amazingly wild. Its one of the great blues albums ever, it certainly has the feeling of a great live seesion in the studio. All the different styles of blues that MR collins played are well represented here: shuffles, slow blues, minor blues, fast sinstrumentals, etc. More satisfying than any compilation. Warning: you'll want more after this"
2,"Thank You for the c.d. in great condition.  We had fast service and would gladly do business with you again.  Thanks again, N and L C"
5,"This is most possibly the illest rap cd to ever hit stores. The two headed monsta Black C and Mr Cee, along with company, Cellski and Hitman put together pounding beats, sick flows, and sweet hooks. The rhymes are very creative. The highlights of this album be ""Blue Bird"" best track on the LP, ""Bounce to this"" gets your pumped for the album. ""I Got my nine"". ""Niggaz on the jock"" ""M.N.O.H.P"" ""Pass the zig zags"" and ""Dedication"" but all the tracks pound. This gem from RBL Posse is a must have for any west coast rap fan"
2,"Lisa Lisa &amp; Cult Jam, guilty pleasure of the middle 80's scene, she was the queen of Freestyle by that time, her music was around every club, and her style will remain in many people minds.  Her sounds were extremely danceable, although some people thought that her voice was a little bit squirky and anoying, it fitted just great to the type of music she wanted to approach, even her hit ballad &quot;All Cried Out&quot; a bittersweet melody with amazing lyrics, that will be covered later by many, fitted her just great, but undoubtly her greatest achievment was dance music, &quot;Head To Toe&quot;, &quot;Lost In Emotion&quot;, where #1's the same year and make everybody love this, sadly she became lost in more pop oriented tunes with the next albums, saving only &quot;Let The Beat Hit Em&quot; that it's truly a comeback to the dance music scene, but too late, the magic was lost and we should point to &quot;Little Jackie Wants To Be A Star&quot; as guilty for throwing Lisa's career to oblivion, but if you forget that and concentrate on the early materials you will find an artist that surface out of the bunch, because they were talented and had a new flavor to offer to the public"
5,"After the last few albums I was losing hope but DAMN this one rocks! Highlights are definitely Die Dead Enough, The Scorpion, Kick The Chair, Back In The Day, Of Mice and Men, and Tears In A Vial. The rest are mediocre but ho wmany albums do you buy anymore with so many great songs"
2,"Couple good renditions but pretty poor sonics and a number of forgettable tunes. Their studio album ""It's a Beautiful Day"" remains the one to own"
5,I HOPE THAT FREDDIE IS WELL AND HOPE TO SEE YOU ALL SOON. WISHING YOU ALL THE BEST IN LIFE. LIFE IS WHAT YOU MAKE IT. YOU MAKE IT EASY LISTENING  HAPPY HOLIDAYS TO AL
1,"With Edward McGee's whiny vocal arrangements coupled with lyrics such as, &quot;I can't stand to see the slaughter, but still I eats the meat&quot;, this album's &quot;chops&quot; are nothing but mindless butchery. The  torture continues with sappy tracks like &quot;You Ought to be Having  Fun&quot; and &quot;Make Someone Happy&quot;. What would truly make me  happy is throwing this album into a bonfire and roasting it to a crisp,  golden brown. Eating this tainted &quot;meat&quot; will leave you with a  bad taste in your mouth. Bon Appetite "
4,"Sometimes I still can't believe the constant quality of Joni Mitchell's discography from the early days in 1968 up until 1980. Mitchell released several masterpieces, not only the well-known Blue and Court & Spark, but also the 'transitional' albums For The Roses annd Hissing Of Summer Lawns can be marked as totally perfect works of art as far as I'm concerned. From there on things got less accesible but actually even more interesting, as Mitchell plunged into the depths of jazz, classical and even African music on Don Juan's Reckless Daughter.   The album takes some time to get used to, but the end-result is a flawed yet fully satisfying album like Blue. Here Mitchell just went through the roof and shamelessly recorded an African drum-and-chant piece (The Tenth World), awkward minimalist-music (the gorgeous Dreamland) and a 16-minute song that packed folk, jazz and classical into one mindblowing piece called Paprika Plains. The other songs continue where Hejira ended, most notably the lovely Jericho and Talk To Me.   The endresult is simply a fantastic record, that many people had problems with upon the original time of release. Too experimental, too weird, too out-there. That may be, but fact is that Don Juan's Reckless Daughter stands as Joni Mitchell's most interesting and boldy innovative work. Ever."
1,"I purchased this as it said it was enhanced with music; it is not enhanced with music, just ocean surf sounds"
5,"This CD has a wonderful selection of songs. I was a little worried at first that they wouldn't be ""original"", but you will not be disappointed. I recommend this CD highly!!!"
2,"i despise this. there is absoluetly no point of listening to this, for you are missing out on ALL of jonathan larsons creation- and it isn't fair to the listener OR the creator. i woudln't waste my money on this. if anything, give it as a present, or as sort of an INTRODUCTION to RENT, but bits and pieces of the magic just is wrong. even if it claims to be ""the best of rent""- i disagree, the BEST of rent is jonathan larsons creation in its entirety"
5,"fans of too short shouild get this features erik sermon, goldy, mc bred, baby d spice 1, shock g, and other goodies definitely a must have plus for old heads shorty b does his tribute to maggot brain with the funkadelic inspired title track sho nuf funky"
2,"the vocals are hella cool but the lyrics are g.ay, and i the layering could have been better.  I kinda like this band but i think  this album could have been alot more then it was. oh well what do i know, i am not doing what their doing, im siting on a computer crying about it, oh well whatever their lucky but i still hate this album, but its still semi ok but just not for me, it make me  yaw"
5,"It seems like when it comes to the Pixies, the talk is generally ""Surfer Rosa this"" and ""Doolittle that,"" and while those are certainly good albums I've never figured out why Bossanova got so much less attention than its two predecessors.  With the exception of Trompe Le Monde (which I plan on getting around to eventually, I swear) I've heard pretty much the Pixies' whole output, and out of of everything this album keeps me coming back the most often.  Bossanova turns down the noise assaults from the Pixies' earlier career down just a bit, but in their place is a more arty, spacey effort that throws some heavy surf-rock influence into the band's already wide-ranging sound.  Sure, there may not be anything that completely matches the sheer visceral immediacy of Broken Face or Tame, but for track-by-track excellence and diversity Bossanova is difficult if not impossible to top.    After the blistering, hard-rocking instrumental opener Cecilia Ann sets the tone, Bossanova immediately commences careening all over the musical map in a way the legions of alternative imitators that emerged in the 90's wouldn't even dream of.  With Black Francis screaming his head off at full volume, the angry, assaultive Rock Music sounds like Debaser on steroids, but from there the album takes a turn into more diverse and overall compelling territory that sounds little like previous albums.  Songs constantly veer off in unpredictable directions, making Bossanova more of an acquired taste than its predecessors, but it's one more than worth acquiring.  This album represents the Pixies' peak as musicians (at least to that point); the rawer edges from Surfer Rosa and Doolittle had definitely been toned down, but those albums didn't contain anything quite like the complex, Talking Heads-like rhythms of Dig For Fire or the dense, proto-grunge sheets of guitar noise of Down to the Well.  The Pixies' legendary use of dynamics was also honed to perfection here: just check out the way the whiplash guitars kick in at the perfect time in the soaring, etheral Velouria, or the way Black Francis's eery vocals and Kim Deal's crawling bassline give way to the headbanging chorus of Is She Weird.    All Over the World is one of the strangest things the Pixies ever did, a sprawling epic (by Pixies standards, anyway) filled with spacey lyrics and searing lead guitar lines from Joey Santiago that seem to come out of nowhere.  And is that a falsetto Black Francis is doing with his voice?  Well, yeah, most of the time, but it works perfectly for the song's trippy, drug-like feel.  Even when they're plowing ahead at full speed, as on Allison and Hang Wire, the band's more tuneful, surf-rock direction is apparent, but it's even more evident on pleasant, literally pacific tracks like Ana and the closing Havalina.    My enduring favorite from this album, though, would have to be Happening.  It doesn't start off all that unusually for a Pixies song, with Black Francis screaming his bizarrely imagistic lyrics on top of some slashing guitars and atomic bass riffs, but over its running time it just gets progressively eerier and more demented, with lots of surfy breaks popping up in the mix, culminating in Black Francis's stream-of-consciousness, half-spoken-half-sung mantra as the song fades out.  It's a total classic, just like this album, and essential listening for those who want to hear alternative rock from back when the label meant something"
1,"Oh my god... how can be possible that such a talented composer had to fall in such deep nonsense, remaking a whole bunch of old tunes to end up like something much worse than even Muzak?  This is the music you'll hear again and again at the supermarket, just sufficiently engineered to num the brain.  Kiss of Life is the only light of hope (and that's why this CD gets 1 star - otherwise should be zero, or even negative!) but that's only because I love Sade"
5,"Truly the best of Ennio Morricone's music: very exciting, diverse and colorful, this CD is a great value. If you like Morricone's music, you'll probably love Arye Geiman - a yet unknown, but young and promising composer, whose music is also very melodic.  [..."
2,"This outing from Steve Wilson and Aviv Geffen was a big disappointment to me. For one, there are no standout songs on this cd. Its all one big mish mosh. I figured that this would be at least as strong as the first Blackfield cd. The songwriting seems weak and slapped together. They are going to have do something spectacular if I buy another cd of theirs. Also the song ""Where is my love"" shouldn't have been redone. It should have been left off this cd"
1,"I bought this CD because this band is from my home town and I've heard good things about them.I hate to have to bash my own city but if these guys are the best Vegas has to offer I don't see much hope for our Rock Scene.This band is no different from most of the other bands you hear on the Nu-Rock stations.It  reminds me of 70's bubble gum pop.Sure some of the songs are catchy,but in a David Cassidy sort of way.The singer sounds like he should be working on the Vegas strip as a Cher Impersonator instead of attempting to sing in a rock band.The Drummer is Boring.His style is Rigid,and it lacks soul.The Guitar players riffs are Flat and uncreative. Every song is about a girlfriend,or breaking up with a girlfriend...Nothing special here.It's todays Glam rock, nothing more...Save your cash"
1,"I am so dissapointed in this CD. I bought it because I have ""Blow By Blow"" and ""Jeff Beck with the Jan Hammer Group"" and I love those CDs. This crap sounds like somebody that heard those recordings, practiced for one week and tried to do an imitation of them. I don't like one cut on the entire CD. I only gave it one star because I couldn't find a way to give it less."
2,"I wanted to like this album, but it simply doesn't compare to Leftism. Leftism was way ahead of it's time and is full of sounds that practially tickle your ears whereas Rhythm & Stealth is full of sounds that are ugly and not nearly as pleasant to listen to. This is my synopsis and apparently I'm not alone as this CD sells for much cheaper on the used market than Leftism.  My advice? Don't miss Leftism but skip Rhythym & Stealth"
5,"There are still those that claim that electronic music is soul-less.  Its made by people on computers who aren't necessarily musicians and don't play any real instruments, therefore they say it lacks the human element that other genres incorporate to move their audience.  Well for those of you still trapped in that mindset I invite you to check out ""One"".  Not only does this record defy that thought but it should enhance your opinion of the capabilites and potential of progressive electronic music.  I was not aware of Dierdre prior to this solo debut however her previous projects were I believe more world/ethno music in nature.  ""One"" is truly a blend of electronic, techno, world & soul and even flirts with the lighter side of drum and bass.  The vocals needless to say are nothing short of breathtaking.  Highlights are the opener ""Waiting For Spring"", ""Close To Us"" & my personal favorite ""A Way To Love"".  Also included and I believe the 1st emphasis track is an unrecognizable cover of The Moody Blues ""Nights In White Satin"".  This record is truly fantastic in every regard and a great reminder of how good electronic music can be"
5,"I became a DOORS fan way back when they released their first album. Forty years later most of their music still bends my ear.  This elaborate box set is worth seeking out, especially given the limited numbers available.  I read some reviews about the CD remixes that were disappointing.  Well, folks, they were wrong.  And if that's all you're looking for they are being released as single CDs in the very near future.  I wanted this for the DTS DVD AUDIO discs that bring this set to twelve discs. Nevermind the historic but boring videos tagged on.  The DTS surround sound  is nothing less than stunning.  From Strange Days through LA Woman, the recordings were obviously meant to be heard this way. The remixes only enhance my favorites.  And this begs my next plea: I have this set, I have Talking Heads Dual Disc BRICK, and Pet Sounds, and the Beatles LOVE, and Lyle Lovett's JOSHUA JUDGES RUTH, Richard Thompson, etc., all in 5.1 surround and/or DTS.   I would really enjoy the Beatles catalogue in DTS, as well as most of Joni Mitchell's catalogue. And Michael Jackson, Dwight Yoakam, Steely Dan, Tom Waits, and any other artist whose music is marked by originality AND impeccable recordings.  The success of PERCEPTION should be a positive indicator that there are tons of music whackos like me willing to shell out hard cash for items like this.  All you record companies that are so worried about pirating and downloading?  Not us! Give us what we want, (and these aren't downloadable)!  Win win! Sony dropped the ball bigtime with SACD, don't let us down like they did!"
2,"Authors note: For some reason I rated this album a 2 out of 5 stars, although I thought I had rated a bit higher, and since I can't change that ""star-rating"" now, I will say this:  This album is good, borderline great at times, and shows at a lot of promise. It's hyper and rough around the edges, but a lot of fun. It contains a handful good songs, and few great ones, here are a few of the standouts:  ""Bicycle, Bicycle, You Are My Bicycle"", and ""Adventure"", are both good...Although I feel that ""We Will Vacation, You Can Be My Parasol"" is a better song, and had they played around with it a bit more in the studio, it could have ""the single"", but it's a great song either way.  The next portion I would like to direct to members BYOP:  Whatever muse you guys followed to come up with ""October, First Account"", keep following it, and if need be, hold it hostage at gunpoint. That song is ""the single"" of the entire album, and if you can recapture that same mojo a bit more on the next album, the skies the limit. "

5,"If you love untainted hymns, you will be blessed by these lofty recorded selections performed by the London Philharmonic Choir and National Philharmonic Orchestra. Two discs compress over fifty hymns to be savored over and over. And no...these are not light and airy, please-every-ear compositions, but are the solid rock truths of the faith. You can even attune to the atoning blood of Christ harmoniously exalted.   My only displeasure was found in the absence of sing along lyrics. To decipher all the stanzas, owning a hymnbook is a must. It is important to obtain one while supplies still exist...I am not completely kidding. My husband and I were at a used book sale where a man was overjoyed to actually find a hymnbook. He wanted to learn the comprehensive praises that are cunningly being pushed out the back door of most churches.   "
5,"When I first heard a song from this album (Sliding Doors) I was driving on I-5, on my way to Pasadena. I pulled off and bought the CD. I give it half a star over the 4 rating, and it would it be worth 5 if the boys had axed &quot;Right Kind of Girl&quot;. There is something painful about the 'siamese cat' line. Probably I just don't get it. &quot;Your Big Night&quot; is Steely Dan adeptly finessed into the 90s. &quot;Star Behind&quot; may have been inspired by The Moody Blues or the Hale-Bopp cult troop, I dunno, but I like the pulsating yet dreamy arrangement. My fave track is &quot;All Dreamed Out&quot;. It is a Satin Doombox"

5,"i've got a few of the Colosseum cd's and i've never been terribly impressed with them...but this incarnation of the band is something else entirely. they take a much more rock approach and prog it out with fantastic results. the pace is driving and speeds along with purpose and supreme musicianship. every song is full of intricate time changes, killer solos, and great vocals. the second disc is a fine addition to the original. there's no sign of a filler cut...it's all outstanding stuff! a nice surprise, overall. i'm hooked"
5,"This is one of the best collections of any band ever compiled! Comes with the classics by Keith and Gregg Ginn that put, black flag on the map!  You just can't go wrong with the quick yet catchy songs that just stay in your head all day long. Fix Me and Wasted are a quick blur and that's how punk songs should be. Not some sort of Opera rock that goes on for nine and a half minutes long... Six Pack was always a funny song to sing along.  ""What are we gonna do!?! the t.v. is broken!!! OH NO we're gonna miss our favorite shows!!""  ""my girlfriend asked me which i liked better i hope she doesn't leave me""  It's kinda of a two for one album when you listen to it because both vocalist brought their own style to the band.  Find out what the fuss is over this band and pick up a classic comp!"
5,"For an artist that has helped shape the musical map since the 70's, and remained a sterling producer, and also has a album workrate to put most musicians to shame, it's truly surprising that Brian Eno, has so many absolutely essential albums to his name.  Here we concentrate on the period where he Created/Produced a series of defining 'Ambient' albums in the mid-late 70's, that although not the first to produce ambient albums, mastered the form to such a degree, that some 20-30 years on, these albums are frequently referenced, when discussing the genre.   Although as much an electronic album as it is an ambient album, the mood here is one of detached sounds, restrained instruments and a slightly Eerie, and atmospheric solitude.  using a system of two reel-to-reel tape recorders, and making the (relatively) simple process of layering sounds on top of one another, Eno was able to make stark simple sounds, from such instruments as...keyboard, synth, organ, but layer them in such a way that although the music rarely changes direction, it's beauty comes in the form of its simplicity.  The first track...the epic ""Discreet Music"" is really nothing more than a melancholic & slight sounding relaxation drone.  But its what Eno does with the sound and the use of spacial sound, that truly makes this impressive.   Brief compositions of synth are gradually brought in and out of the mix, and although most listeners won't realise it on the first listen, but the relation of these elements changes over time, albeit it very gradually, and coupled with the subtle use of noise and resonance, it reveals a sound of soothing 'ambience' that washes over the listener.  The ""Three Variations on the Canon in D Major"" is more consistent with the stylisation of 'Classical' music, with it less akin to 'Ambient' music, and more in keeping with the compositional elegance and arrangement of piano led orchestration.  which has a  rather melancholy and restless feel to it, and the tone of the strings/piano feels vastly different to the synth-led first track, and its arguably the more immediate track, due to its more noticeable increase in volume/tempo, and although a more rounded sound, still remains very delicate and gentle.  In fact imagine these beautifully crafted tracks as works for soundtracks  for films that were never filmed, as it's deeply beguiling and littered with the romanticism that became a trademark in Eno's series of 'Ambient' Albums.  As it's all so precisely performed and tremendously realised, that one can't help but fall in love with this incredible album.   If you picked up any of Eno's other 'Ambient' albums, I really can't stress enough, how utterly recommended this album comes, It's not only considered one of his finest 'Ambient' albums, but also just a truly exceptional album regardless of the genre.   Utterly Essentia"

5,"This wonderful collection of stories is a favorite of mychildren. My children ask for this one again and again, but I enjoyhearing the masterfully told stories so much, I don't mind hearing it over and over myself"
2,Listening to this cd took me back to my growing-up years.  I remembered all their songs I loved back then.  It's a great homecoming
2,"""Nonsuch"" is one of those records that I think was doomed to failure-- having constructed (with a little help from Todd Rundgren) a thematic song cycle (""Skylarking"") and an album of perhaps the best pop music in two decades (""Oranges & Lemons""), the bar was set pretty high for XTC, and in an attempt to reach it, they seemed to have overreached a bit.  It's not that the album is bad per se, it's just so carefully arranged and produced to have lost the edge that made its predecessors so great.  The band seems to have distilled themselves down to midtempo numbers, occasionally finding a bit of a driving electric sound (opener ""The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead""), but largely sticking to a quieter, balladry style, often primarily piano driven.  Sometimes it works out quite nicely, the lovely, chirping staccato guitars on ""Humble Daisy"" provide ample support for a simply fantastic lead vocal by Andy Partridge, and certainly the lilting off-rhythm of ""Then She Appeared"" is downright captivating, but more likely than not, the pieces end up blending one into another as pretty much unmemorable pop songs that are inoffensive and ok but just not attention getting (Colin Moulding's ""My Bird Performs"", Partridge's ""The Disappointed"").  To cap things off, the album stretches over an hour long, and by the end of the record, even the more intriguing material (""The Ugly Underneath"") seems to blend in with the rest.  It's tough though, becaue none of it is particularly bad, and in fact, all sorts of neat stuff is going on throughout-- great three part harmonies (Brian Wilson style with a falsetto over the top) catch the ear on ""Dear Madam Barnum"", ""Wrapped in Grey"" twists and turns every which way, ""War Dance"" features an intriguing clarinet opening that leads into a set of reeds providing support for Moulding's venomous lyrics... it goes on.  In fact, with such detailed arrangements, everything's guaranteed to be interesting in some regard, but what it lacks is that feeling of spontaneity and energy.  One nice thing is that at least with this reissue and its remastered sound, you can make out the subtleties of the record nicely.  Bottom line, there's a lot better by XTC-- ""Nonsuch"" is an ok record, but they've done a whole lot more"
5,"I've loved this CD ever since we got it at my college radio station... Sarge definitely knows how to rock! At the same time, the band shows good range so each song doesn't sound the same.  I especially love the lyrics,  which express a spectrum of raw emotion and real-life issues, from a girl's  revenge for getting gang-raped to thoughts on &quot;how far is too  far?&quot;.  The vocals are never overpowered by the music (which says a  lot because the music is definitely kickass)"
5,"Hello there people looking into buying THUG LIFE VOLUME 1.  i would first like to start with a little information on THUG LIFE which was the name of a rap group which featured 2pac, big syke, mopreme and a few other's. if you are a 2pac fan you may of already heard of this album although this album is one of 2pacs most unrecornised albums and when 2pac founded the group in 1993 they where quite unknown to the public and it was only after 2pac was shoot when people noticed the album.   the THUG LIFE group may better today be known as the OUTLAWZ with big syke changing his name to MUSSILINI on the outlawz albums 2pac to MAKAVELI, MOPREME did not stay with the group when they changed there names to the OUTLAWZ which was a shame due to the fact MOPREME was one of the better rappers on the THUG LIFE album, he was also the son of the late MUTULU shakur which was 2pacs stepfather. mutulu is mentioned alot in 2pacs older albums due to the fact mutulu was there for tupac and tupac saw him as a father figure,  even though mutulu was placed on the FBI's MOST WANTED LIST after escaping from prison in the 80's tupac looked up to him.   the name THUG LIFE is a name 2pac called the group with the meaning : The Hate U Gave Little Infants F**k Every1 which spells out thug life if you use the first letter in every word.  the notoious B.I.G was also meant to join the group when they had first started but the record label desided against it and removed b.i.g  * THE ALBUM * This is a old classic album and fans of tupac would be expected to have this place near the top shelf of any cd rack, due to tupacs death the rise of price's to shakurs albums means they have shoot up quite a lot and you could be expected to pay from $15 and upwards per album but at the moment i think this album is going rather cheap.  if your a fan of ALL EYEZ ON ME and alot of tupacs latier stuff and style then this album may not be your best album to buy, tupac is often well know for his poetic rhyming and graphic lyrics but this album is more hardcore and talk's about diffrent topics in one song rather then the song telling a story of just one topic ie: tear drops and close caskets  there seems to be more of a darker side to this album and although the album is diffrent to shakurs newer stuff this album is still a brilliant album, ( i didn't leave this album to be the last one to buy till i finished my pac collection, i think it was the 3rd i bought )  there are some brilliant songs on this album, songs like HOW LONG WILL YOU MORN ME in memory for kado (R.I.P) Which also D.M.X. does a memorial for KADO at the end of WHERE THE HOOD AT vidoe  even if you buy the album for HOW LONG WILL THEY MORN ME it is still money well spent due to the song been such a classic with great lyrics and a brilliant choaros by NATE DOGG, there are other great song on there too with great basic background beats of the drums with a funky tune the come over the drums. plent of song reach out and touch you when listening to the lyrics and you will find your self listening to the album more and more once you own it, also the lyrics are easy to pick up on and means easier to sing along with (we all like a good sing along) i would recomend this album to first time buyer's and defo to old 2pac fans who havn't got it yet.    thank you for taking the time to read my review, i hoped it help you in your choice. please feel free to leave coments and to also look at my other reviews by clicking on ""see all reviews"" button next to my name"
4,"This is a fine creation of the 80's, with many classic songs.  But we must not overlook the fact that the best song on here was not even released. It's name: &quot;The Working Hour.&quot; Check it out it is haunting"
4,"I noticed that all the reviews are pretty short, so I'll try and keep mine short, as well. I bought this album around seven or eight years ago when I was a bachelor and living in a 600 square foot backhouse. Because my personal dwelling space was so small, I wanted to create an illusion that my place was big, spacious and open and I did that not only through carefully choosing my furniture and accessories, but by creating  a ""big atmosphere"" through the music I chose to play when I had guests over.  Whenever I played this CD at dinner parties I threw, people literally stopped and noticed the music. I had a few people snicker and say that the music was silly and outdated, but for the most part, people really seemed to enjoy it and paid less attention to the obvious fact that everyone was crammed in my little place like sardines in a can.  What I'm suggesting is that this music has a lot of heart, a lot of soul, a lot of punch for the buck. If you find yourself listening to the same old music, you might just want to pick up this CD and expose yourself to something so cool, it's hot"
2,"I Like About 3 or 4 songs on here. I hate to sound negative but what i do not like about this cd is that, Jo'Omeara sounds very pitchy in most of the songs...Her voice starts to sound flat and very monotone after 1 or 2 songs. She Does'nt have much range. She Just raises her voice. Her voice sounds shakey and unstable. especially on ""Relentless"" the very first track. I love the song,i really do but her voice sounds like any minute shes gonna break down and cry. I am not a great singer myself but,Jo Omeara needs some voice lessons. Her voice is very drab and boring. It's Nothing extra.   For some reason she sounded so much better with S Club 7...you know what,the songs on the album are great,if Kelly Clarkson or Jessica Simpson sang them. I listen to the songs and just imagine ""what if...""...it gets me through the songs i like"
1,This album really sucks.  The only good song on it is the last song on the tape
5,"I'd never thought I'd like Debbie Gibson, but I guess I was wrong.  Most of her songs on this CD are great, and I aboulutely love them.  I personally like ""Out of the Blue"", ""Foolish Beat"", ""Only in my Dreams"" and ""Shake Your Love"". They are all good songs.  She is very talented and mauture for her age. Although I wasn't a teen back then, I have heard of her.  If you like 80's music and are a Debbie fan, then this CD is for you. This CD gets me going whenever I listen to it. I like pop music and 80's music for that matter too. Hope this review is helpful to you. "
1,"I bought this album unheard because I was such a fan of Prince.  Bad move.  I agree with the last reviewer.  I tried to like it.  I really did.  But, there is nothing on here worth listening to, let alone dancing to.  The subject matter didn't bother me (he's certainly been controversial before), but I listened to the entire album straight through and couldn't tell where one song began and another ended.  Bored now.  Only buy this if you're a completist"
5,"Only die hard fans of GERSHWIN should buy the massive songbook ELLA AND NELSON RIDDLE made in 1959 ,because the great songs are all included here.Back in those days ,GERSHWIN was still considered the best AMERICAN composer, probably because he was the only one who tried the classical experience and succeeded ,and also because of the fact that he died young.Nowadays we know that RICHARD RODGERS and JOHNNY MERCER are the deserving legends of AMERICAN popular music.Having said that let me say that this collection is perfect,it's really the best.Personal favorites of mine are SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME and BUT NOT FOR ME.Even the guy from TEXAS should enjoy that one"
5,"This excellent 1975 album shows Hatfield & the North adopting a full blown Canterbury rock sound - a nice mixture of quirky prog and jazz rock.  Although folks refer to a Canterbury style before 1975 (I include myself here too), the bands lumped under the Canterbury style pre-1975 were incredibly disparate and utilized a broad spectrum of musical styles.  The Henry Cow (experimental) - Caravan (pop prog) continuum comes to mind in fact.  It was not until the mid-1970s however, that a distinct Canterbury sound emerged (quirky, proggy, jazz rock) and this album is a superb example.  The core lineup includes a virtual who's who of Canterbury rock: Phil Miller (guitars); drummer Pip Pyle; Richard Sinclair (vocals, bass guitar); and Dave Stewart (Hammond organ, electric piano, tone generator.  The additional musicians are also among the Canterbury luminaries and include Jimmy Hastings (flute, soparano and tenor saxophone); Mont Campbell (French horn); Lindsay Cooper (oboe and bassoon); Tim Hodgkinson (clarinet), and finally the Northettes (Barbara Gaskin, Amanda Parsons, and Ann Rosenthal).  All of the musicians are absolutely top shelf and the individual performances are breathtaking.  The ensemble work is also very intricate and there are some fairly dexterous meter shifts.  I feel that Richard Sinclair's vocals (and bass playing) are both excellent and it is always a treat to hear him perform whether with Caravan, Hatfield & the North, or Camel.  The nine tracks on the album are arranged into two largish suites, including tracks 1-8 and the massive 20'13 Mumps suite.  As I mentioned, although progressive rock is the dominant style, there is a good bit of jazz rock.  In fact, there may be slightly more jazz rock than was found on the 1974 debut.  There is also the whimsical Canterburian sense of humor - I think this is also a distinctive feature of the Canterbury ""thing"".  Greater emphasis is placed on instrumental sections and lengthy ""jams"" are scattered across the album, where Dave and Phil really get a chance to shine.  The Northettes also add a very nice, dreamy touch to each piece, and the woodwind playing, (especially Jimmy's flute work), heighten this effect.  There are also brief experimental sections too - the last few minutes of Fitter Stoke has a Bath is a good example of this.  Overall, although I don't feel that Rotter's Club is much different than the debut, some folks might notice a bit of more of a jazz rock approach.    The bonus tracks include alternate takes of Big John Wayne Socks Psychology on the Jaw and Chaos at the Greasy Spoon, in addition to the extremely jazzy track Halfway between Heaven and Earth, the thunderous (it is unbelievably heavy) Oh, Len's Nature!, and the once again very jazz-rocky Lying and Gracing (it sounds live but there is no indication of where it was recorded).  These last three tracks are superb.  All in all, this is an excellent Hatfield & the North album and is highly recommended along with the 1973 debut"
1,It's sad to see a band with this much talent play a bunch of poppish songs that sound like rejects from singer/songwriters or the Dixie Chicks. You'd really never know this was an Irish band. I'll be trying to unload this CD ASAP
2,Such a title should deserve better quality... Other CDs of Piazzolla are much better
5,"When I first heard Hatfield and The North back in -73, the music made a distinct impression on me. I love the sound of this band, with the easily recognizeable sound of the Northettes, arrangements Rhodes el-piano, solos with the Lowery organ (***** to Dave Stewart), the sleepy voice of Richard Sinclair and overall atmosphere. Great work, still after all these years I keep this band as one of my favorites..."
2,"The songs are poor, the recording quality is worse. For some reason no one can duplicate the sacd multichannel quality in Dire Straits or Allison Krause"
1,"I bought 4 of their cd's from amazon after hearing the song ""bad days"" in a batman movie. This cd is the worst of the 4 i bought. Not one good song. Totally lame. I'm not even going to stick someone else with it. I'm just going to throw it out"
2,"For me, the performance simply missed the mark. A capable choir should be able to stand forth and sing out without a surround of distracting instrumentation. Though the poor have already suffered enough, I promptly gave my copy of this CD to charity. For that I beg forgiveness"
2,"Technicaly this is an excellent performance, however the choice of selections is doleful and does not bring much Christmas cheer to the listener.  The earlier CD releases by Chanticlier were wonderful but this one misses the mark"
5,"The other reviewers said this was THE Coe record. I gotta say it is! If you want to hear saloon-singin', get this. You can almost taste the sour whiskey and smell the smoke while Dave Allen Coe hits his licks"
1,"I give this CD one star, not because it isn't good, but, because it is the same stuff they have already sold once. I am a big Blind Melon fan. I was fortunate to see them live 3 times and they were great, but, when you can download songs like Mother Earth, Whoa God, Tickled Pink, and Rebirth. I have to wonder why they would release an album that is all old stuff. The only people interested in this album would be melon fans. Evident by how poorly Nico did in sales, This is very disappointing, it seems they are broke and are trying to rip the true fans off. There is nothing new, so do yourself a favor and just bust out your old CD's and play them, don't buy this, unless you don't own the albums.  The surviving members should be ashamed of themselves"
1,"O.K. When I heard that Dave was going to remaster/re-release the Megadeth back catalog I got real excited. I still believe that this album is a true masterpiece, but when I bought the 2004 remaster/remixed version I was MORTIFIED!!!! What was Dave thinking when he decided to remix it. All it needed was to be beefed up just a little, but he went to great extremes to ruin it. I know Megadeth fans were pretty pissed about this, but the one thing I did remember is that the first time I heard Countdown... when it was release in 1992 it gave me chills........period! I have regrets about buying all the remasters at once.......BIG MISTAKE!!! So in closing I went back and found the original versions of So Far...So Good...So What!, Rust in Peace, and of course Countdown to Extinction, and yes Capitol Punishment...The Megadeth Years. I'm glad that I was able to locate them"
2,"To call this the Best of Fleetwood Mac is a little far-fetched--it does not include any of their hits and great songs from 1967-1974, forgetting the songwriting of Peter Green, Danny Kirwan, and Bob Welch..It is not a complete so called greatest hits without including the early era--the title should have read-Fleetwood Mac-the best of Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham.  I am not knocking this lineup and I love the songs but my favorite is Fleetwood Mac--the Blues--the Roots.  I suggest the Then Play On album to get a really good idea how Fleetwood Mac was before Stevie and Lindsay..  Also, do not forget Bob Welch and Mystery to Me album--another Gem!!!"
5,"To even begin to describe the music on this CD is difficult...it's like trying to describe what God looks like. Not only is the music just incredible, but the two female singers have to be the best two voices on the planet. Luker's Salve Regina had me in tears at the end (and I am getting all misty eyed just thinking about it now). Scott's singing is just remarkable. If Angels sing they sound like these two women. For heaven's sake just buy the CD!!"
1,"What's wrong with BHG? Besides everything? Is it possible for them to write more than one good song in their pathetic lives? My sister burned this CD from a friend, most likely because she likes the Bad Touch song, and I'VE been the one having to hear it in the morning when she's getting ready for school. It's pathetic. I don't know how much I can stress the word ""pathetic"", but it's the only way to fully describe it. Out of 18 tracks, there's one, count it, ONE good song, ""The Inevitable Return of The Great White Dope"", because it's nothing like their other songs. Everything else on this album is just like ""Fire Water Burn"", ""The Bad Touch"", ""Hell Yeah"", you get the picture. Palm-muted, droning, songs with extremely explicit lyrics, which is the only reason people will remember them. Isn't it about time to come out of the 13-16 year old stage? Having lyrics about sex won't get you any. Bands like Blink-182, Sum 41, and System of a Down have funny songs, but they have their limits. About the ""music"": 1)Palm-muting doesn't make a song good. I get it. You can palm-mute. So can most people who play guitar or bass. 2)Make your music more diverse and varied, or at least change your patterns. Elastica's self-titled album has 4-chord patterns, except they play faster, and the songs aren't much longer than two and a half minutes long (not that I'm comparing BHG to Elastica). 3)Do what you do ""best"", and don't try metal. ""Magna Cum Nada"" is BHG's horrible attempt to make something metal-ish. Stop. The problem with Bloodhound Gang is that they just won't die. People like them somehow, and so they feel compelled to squeeze out more and more crap that gets worse and worse as it progresses, not saying that they were ever good.  Why don't we go through the songs and rate them, shall we?  1. I Hope You Die: See track 15 2. The Inevitable Return of The Great White Dope: Best song by BHG, but still not great. 3. Mama's Boy: See track 15 4. Three Point One Four: See track 15 5. Mope: See track 15 6. Yummy Down On This: See track 15  Catch my drift yet? I don't think I can fully show my displeasure with words. ""1 star , because 0 is not an option"" is exactly correct.  People, if you actually want Bloodhound Gang, copy it from someone. Maybe if they see their record sales go down, they'll actually think about quitting.  p.s. Track 15 is called ""This is Stupid."
4,"Alan Silvestri does great work when writing for action films and this really shows his unique talents. The main theme for the volcano itself is a 6 note low brass motif used frequently throughout. Parts of the score are similar to Eraser in instrumentation and orchestrations. One thing I was not too impressed with was the sound recording. It is a decent recording, but the overall sound is low and you have to crank up the volume to really hear it good. The best cue of them all is the thrilling ""March of the Lava"" which includes all of the main elements of the score, with strong low brass rhythms, pulsating brass trills, ostinato strings, and driving, militaristic snare drums. ""Team Work"" and ""Build A Wall"" are also enjoyable tracks with snare drums and heavy brass, especially those trombone shrill sounds that Elliot Goldenthal has been known to use. ""Main Title"" is a suspenseful track that does not use the volcano theme, but instead uses a light 4 note theme that you never hear again. Some romantic, dramatic music appears in the final track ""Cleansing Rain"" to bring the score to a close. Overall, a great action score that serves both the film and your CD player well"
5,"Jimmie Rodgers had a wonderful, reedy tenor.  He was a first-rate singer.  The surprises here are the lesser known songs that are beauts, for example TLC Tender Love and Care, Child of Clay (which reminds me of Elvis's In the Ghetto), and especially the lush and soulful Wonderful You.  The last mentioned song is a real treat, absolutely delicious.  Three songs missing that I would like to have were his versions of Just a closer walk with thee, The Wreck of John B. and The World I used to know.  Hope someday Jimmie's A&amp;M releases will be out on CD too.  In the meantime, I recommend this collectio"
2,"I'm a big Sytx fan and have most of their studio albums so this collection isn't of interest to me.  But the omissions of Don't Let it End, Why Me and Love at First Sight prompted me to give this a poor rating.  I guess Anthology doesn't technically mean best of or greatest hits, but I hate when collections are put together and charting singles are left out.  I would recommend getting Greatest Hits and Greatest Hits Part 2 if you're just looking for a Styx collection"
4,"I've been a Linda Ronstadt fan for years, and must say this cd pretty well covers her bigger hits.  It doesn't quite cover all my favourites, but there's only so many songs they can fit on one cd.  Cheers, Hazel"
2,I like listening to George Michael as I personally feel he has a great voice but this album is not really for me. I like almost all of his music but I could have skipped this one and it would not have been a loss
1,"Well seeing all the reviews on here and being a former fan of sugar ray along with being bored to death at work I've decided to write my own review.  I believe sugar ray had something special with the first two albums as well but as time went by they have gradually gone from ultra-hip, I just wanna drink beer and cause trouble types, to oh so sappy songs about love and how heart break sucks, nothing that hasn't been told a thousand times over. When I first hearsd Sugar Ray back in 97 I thought their sound was revolutionary, I bought Floored and liked all the tracks and soon found myself buying the first album, then the third, fourth, and fifth albums came out, the third one was alright i bought it for the songs that weren't radio friendly such as Glory, Personal Space Invader, and Burning Dog; And with the release of their fourth album I bought it as well, hoping that they would get back on formula; Yes as you might of guessed i was delusional; their music had seemed to had gotten worse as predicted.....Now with the release of their fifth album, they had already lost me as a fan so therefore, I give all three of the most recent albums of theirs a 1/5 stars for lack of originality"
5,"If you are familiar with Greg Brown, you probably are familiar with this release. If you don't have it, get it and treat yourself to an experience that take you on a journey of loves lost and loves to come. For those who are curious about Greg's work, this is an excellent place to start. There is not a bad cut here, and in particular, &quot;Dream Cafe&quot;, &quot;Spring Wind&quot; and &quot;Laughing River&quot; are a trio of songs that somehow work some sort of magic into allowing me to see into life a bit deeper for a period of time. Two other releases that go along well with this are &quot;Further In&quot; and &quot;The Poet Game.&quot"
5,Great old standards and some new stuff thrown in from jolly ole England.  Wonderful selection and performance.  Great addition to holiday collection
2,"Okay, some of this is awesome: the ballads Ain't Gone 'n' Give Up on Love and Life Without You are the best; Change It is a great blues-rocker, and his guitar livens up even weaker material like Say What! and Come On, pt. 3. Still, this is a thin album overall. Lookin' Out the Window; Look at Little Sister; You'll Be Mine and Empty Arms are among Stevie's worst. Stick to the first two records instead, plus maybe In Step."
5,"Lisa Gerrard's music moves me in ways that no other singer/musician does. Being a DCD fan, I bought Mirror Pool & Duality the day they were released. (They are still my favories)  The Insider is a great movie. Some of the best work I have seen from Crowe & Pacino. Lisa captures the mood (much like she did with Gladiator) with her special unique voice & style.  Lisa's music has a powerful effect on me and makes me feel as if I am going through a re-birthing. The sadness & pain of letting go of the past coupled with the hope and anticipation of what is to come. The struggle & release cycles throughout her music but always leaves me feeling at peace. Meltdown at the end of this score fits perfectly. I love to meditate to Lisa's music and let her take me on a beautiful journey. Art at its finest"
4,"i have to admit Rifkin's version of the B Minor Mass, although shocked me a bit at first, managed to convert me to the one-singer-per-part theory. the point is that in Bach's sacred music human voices are used as instruments & usually pit against the instruments. so the chorus includes both the vocalists and the instrumentalists. with this in mind, Rifkin's theory works out fantastically in his musical directorship. the sounds are crisp, the balance between the vocalists and the ensemble is perfect. I got this CD after being convinced by the Mass in B Minor. Highly recommended"
5,"The debate over the performance of J.S. Bach's cantatas boils down to the  following: the evidence suggests that Bach only had one singer per part for  performances of his cantatas. Thus, any historically accurate performance  of these works will maintain the one-singer-per-part approach. At the same  time, however, there is additional evidence that Bach wanted more  performers. We are thus stuck with deciding whether Bach wrote for the  musical forces he had on hand (which seems logical enough) or whether he  composed for the performers he would like to have (which would seem silly,  if he knew there would not be enough musicians to realize his intentions.  On the other hand, Bach does make &quot;solo&quot; and &quot;tutti&quot;  distinctions in the score... draw your own conclusions).  Rifken is a  strong supporter of the one-performer-per-part approach, which may seem a  little sparse at first. Yet, when one listens to the various cantatas on  these disks, one must confess that these sound, well, beautiful. This may  not be an approach which would work for all of Bach's works, but the  effectiveness on these disks certainly lends the interpretation validity.  Regardless of where you fall-- and if you fall-- in the strenuous debates  over historical performance, I would heartily recommend this disk. Not only  are the performances polished, but the works themselves are exquisite-- a  wonderful sampling of Bach's cantatas. (Personally I am addicted to the  duet, &quot;Wir eilen mit schwachen, doch emsigen Schritten&quot; from BWV  74 which I could gladly listen to over and over-- listen to it and you will  see why."
2,"I think Beyonce has talent&is one of those Musical Acts with that Certain ""IT"",but at the same time her musical tendency's tend to be over the top. vocally she goes overboard&over things tend to  bring down her attempts at what she is trying to get to. this song is just part 2 of ""Crazy in Love"" which was a better track. this song sounds like it jacks Teena Marie's 'Square Biz"". bringing back Jay Z is a waste of time because his rap on here makes no sense whatsoever. her vocal runs are nice& the channeling of Tina Turner is cool in places,but  more records like this show while Beyonce has a pressence along with charisma&is a Foxxy mama,but making  another so-so track is not a good look at a career that could&Should be something special in time"
1,"...Or the other reviews.  Those reviews probably came from someone in their camp.  When I first saw these two, I said ""no they did not!""  If you go to a music  store it n the rap section and look through it, you will find knock-offs of known and real rappers.  These guys have their names for the simple reason of trying to confuse a would be buyer of Mobb Deep.  These two clowns are nothing more than sucker MC's trying to get a dollar off of someone else's hard earned names.  If you are new to hip-hop or just young, there IS a reason rappers used to talk about something called a sucker MC(a fake rapper, someone without skills, someone you hear and you know they should not be rapping) and these clowns are it"
5,"This is a great debut album from a very talented Canadian artist named Amanda Marshall. She's had big success in Canada, but not so much in the US. I don't understand why that is, and if you listen to this CD I think you'll agree with me. There was 6 big singles from this album, and even the non single tracks are awesome. The closing track ""Promises"" is stunning and raw in emotion. ""Let It Rain"" was the first single and it's definately a powerful song that resonates with listeners, a song about searching for redemption. ""Dark Horse"" was also a big hit. ""Birmingham"" is a great song about a woman in an abusive relationship who finally leaves her man. ""Fall From Grace"" and ""Beautiful Goodbye"" were also singles and other favorites of mine. I highly recommend checking this CD out if you haven't already"
2,"The orchestra was small and the instrumention poor.  Most of the pieces were short in comparison to the original movie scores, and tempos of some of the pieces were so different from the original movie scores that it made listening frustrating"
5,This is the most hilarious CD with a classical bent I have ever heard. Allen Sherman is gifted when it comes to imaginative uses of classical themes. Anyone who has heard any of these famous melodies will laugh themselves silly when they hear what is done to them! It's a super pick-me-up when I'm feeling blue. It's a must-hear for all you classical music buffs!
5,"Bowie's second instalment in the Berlin trilogy is a criminally underrated masterpiece, brimming with invention and vigour.  'Low' was most certainly an amazing achievement and an absolute treat to listen to, but unlike most, I feel that ""Heroes"" tops it in every regard.  The first side (like 'Low', containing the more conventional songs) has more urgency than the tracks on 'Low'. There is more energy and more depth to the song writing. Where 'Low' was fragments/ideas with magnificent textural framing, Heroes' first side shows really intricate song writing being beautifully combined with dense and innovative arrangements that take the clunky synth and electronic sounds of 'Low' and fuse them into a more sophisticated whole.  The lyrics are also much more intriguing. 'Low' was lyrically and vocally quite sparse, but on ""Heroes"", Bowie delivers some of his most compelling lyrics. Just couple of the fantastic snippets that pop up include:  'Your lips cut a smile on your face'  'There's slaughter in the air Protest on the wind Someone else inside me Someone could get skinned'  'Sons of the silent age... Don't walk, they just glide in and out of life They never die, they just go to sleep one day'  And of course we all know the gorgeous lyrics that the title track possesses. Not to mention Bowie's ultimate vocal performance on this track. In fact, the vocals on the ""Heroes"" album soar like on no other release of his. The songs climax and Bowie belts out some amazingly expressive and emotive performances. Overall, the first half of the record takes the best parts of `Low's' first half and 'Station to Station' and turns it into the most successful and engaging group of tracks that he has ever released.    The second half of the album sees Bowie reprising the ambient themes explored on 'Low' but once again this album outdoes its predecessor. The instrumental tracks on ""Heroes"" are even more evocative than those on 'Low'. Bowie and Eno once again strip away the clunky synth and electronic sounds and create more focused and more atmospheric pieces second time around.  Bowie feels like more of a presence on this album overall. Less detached, and not hiding away from himself as much. This is further displayed by the re-introduction of his sax playing on a number of tracks. He adds personality and flair to 'Sons of the Silent Age', provides one of many gorgeous melodic layers on 'V-2 Schneider' (which trumps both 'The Speed of Life' and 'A New Career In A New Town'), and his free-jazz styled, heavily treated playing on 'Neukoln' is oddly appealing. Bowie also plays the Japanese Koto on 'Moss Garden' giving a beautifully subtle and sensitive performance on what is a perfect ambient piece.  If you own 'Low', love it, and are wondering which album to get next... well I can't recommend ""Heroes"" highly enough. If you own 'Station to Station' and love it... ditto. If you have some of Bowie's other albums from some of his other periods and are curious about which of the more experimental albums to start with, this is the one. It's one of those albums that is experimental without compromising quality song writing. It takes the ideas first generated on 'Low' and expands and improves upon them, while introducing a highly unique and infinitely appealing aesthetic all of its own. It is also more timeless than 'Low'. It's sounds are still fresh and haven't dated a bit in the 30 years since its release.   It is not only the best of the Bowie and Eno collaborations (The Berlin Trilogy), it is also, in my opinion, the greatest achievement by this most amazing artist."
1,"The A1A Album includes ""God's Own Drunk"" and this is not included on the CD with the same title.  How did this happen?  We main purpose we purchased the CD for this song and it's not here"
1,"Lets get 1 fact out: IRON MAIDEN DOESNT CARE ANYMORE!!!  How can they be SO brilliant with # of the beast, Piece of Mind & PowerSlave & then put out 5 terrible records in a row starting with X-factor?  This record is soooo boring! I bought it based on Wickerman which I found to be OK, reminiscent of  the old Iron Maiden & then they just ran completely out of material. Track 2 on sounds exactly the same, long boring slow tunes that never end.. going track after track, album after album. Does ""Dream of Mirrors"" ever end? I cant ever tell.. I just lose my attention due to its such a GD drag. Then they hit me with ""Thin Line"" which is even less interesting than the most boring professor I had in the most boring class in my entire college career.   You cant listen to the original ""Iron Maiden"" release & then seriously listen to this new crap & release it, unless you just dont care. Obviously they dont CARE!! This record is TERRIBLE!  If they did care they would relisten to the first 6 or so & rethink thier efforts & either improve the sound or just end Iron Maiden & come out with a new band named ""Too old, too tired!"" & quit defiling the great name of ""IRON MAIDEN"""
4,"how can anyone write so many great songs? c'mon people, plunk down the forty-five stinking bucks and experience the unearthly genius of robert pollard. if you are already a fan, there is no excuse to NOT have this. as one might expect, this is not the starters place to look. bee thousand, alien lanes or the safer(more NORMAL sounding) isolation drills would be the best choices.   nice packaging, good booklet. excellent liner notes. pick your favorite 20 or 25 songs and make the ultimate GbV disc. what a joy the suitcase is."
1,"A Best of White Lion album? What are they selling blank CDs? Seriously, the 80's had great bands, but towards the end things were getting a little ridiculous. The final nail in the coffin for 80's rock was White Lion and Warrant. Nuff said"
2,"White Lion were just a rip off of Van Halen, except VH were better.  I can't believe some of these reviews, I have listened to this album intensely, the guitar player was copying Eddie VH not only on his tapping, but wangy bar and riff building.  The songs make you wanna heave, &quot;Little Fighter&quot;, &quot;when the Children Cry&quot; and &quot;Love don't come easy&quot;, this was just a sad attempt at trying to cash in with the glam rock chart material of the time, but they failed.  If this is the best of, then I'd hate to imagaine what the worst of sounds like, cause it must be diabolical"
1,"Buy this disc if you want to feel like someone stole your favorite toy, tagged it with profane sharpie writing, and then tried to sell it back to you as something new;  Gavin's version of we are the champions made me feel like stabbing myself in the eye with my pen;   Eleven's version of stone cold crazy made me feel like i was having a seriously horrible acid trip;   and breaking benjamin's version of who wants to live forever sounded like i had the vocals slowed down but the music was sped up;   good rock song + crappy artists = cringe worthy remakes that never should have been released;  this album is only getting 1 star because i dont think it will let me give it 0 and Constantines version of bohemian rhapsody is awesome! it the only song worth listening and you can probably download it some where or get it from your dumb friend who bought the disc and then relized it what a piece of crap...  "
5,"Only gay song here is Victim of a Criminal.  Everything else makes for a complete album with some real winners like Liquid Separation, Plasma Springs, Sex Offender, and This Faith.  In my opinion the essence of FLA lies in Gashed Senses & Crossfire, State of Mind and TNI, but Millennium is just a killer cd regardless of who put it out.  If you're new to FLA and this is the only one you have heard and you like the style then you might not like other FLA before this release.  I think they tried to evolve Millennium into later releases but failed.  Its one of those cd's so good it was probably an accident.  :"
5,"When I first heard this album back in 1994, I did not like it all. I was expecting Tactical Neural Implant part two. However, later on in life and with a much broader palate for music I must say that I love it. It was a stroke of genius to add the layer of guitars and I love the hard edged sound which sounds like a mix between Ministry, FLA, Die Krupps and even Front 242. The cover is a very odd thing that does not look like anything at all and the text is not all that great. The lyrics are interesting and they make up for the not so great vocals with plenty of energy and a tremendous tallent to make cross over music. The guitar layer is amazing and add a brutal edge to an already grimm sound. FLA show on this album that they can mix and match their sound and still be able to create amazing music."
1,"Perhaps I'm just getting old, and maybe I just have such a special place in my heart for Dionne's recordings from earlier in her career, but this recording just doesn't cut it.  I understand the necessity and the desire to ""update"" old hits from one's singing career to make them ""sing"" to a new generation of listeners, but there is an annoying sameness to each song.  The electronic instruments dominate way too much, particularly the percussion.  Where's an acoustic piano?  Not one horn?  Not even a small string section?  This must have been a pretty low budget project.  If you are a Dionne Warwick fan or are eager to listen to her music for the first time, first go back to her recordings from the 60's.  Then try some of her music from the ""Heartbreaker"" and ""Deja Vu"" period.  But don't waste your money on this one.  I hope Dionne's next project has a bit more imagination and better instrumental arrangements. "
5,"The guitar intro to RIPTIDE is worth the price of this CD alone.  Lou really shines on EGG CREAM, ADVENTURER, RIPTIDE, SET THE TWILIGHT REELING and FINISH LINE.  The only week song on this collection is HOOKY WOOKY.  I bought this CD in 2004 and I can't stop listening to it.....very groovy!"
5,"I am assuming if you are reading this, I don't really have to say anything technical about Mozart or these GREAT late string quartets. I am only writing this review to let you know... For anyone who is disappointed with the performance and sound quality of The Berg Quartet's EMI Mozart collection of these same quartets, this is a horse of a different color. Recorded in the early 90s for Teldec before the  Berg's signed with EMI, These performances are sublime.  You would not belive this is the same group that made those horrid EMI records. This is THE Bergs we all know and love and nobody before or since has made Mozart's string quartets sound this good. Perfect intonation, TONE, blend, dynamics and yes, PASSION. I've had many collections of these works and this leads the field. BY FAR. THIS ONE HAS IT ALL.... And the Teldec sound stage is the cleanest and crystal clear you'll ever hear. With wonderful front to back depth and air around every note. Demonstration sound with great imaging and transparency. You can ""literally"" step inside this recording. Well you know what I mean. It really doesn't get any better than this"
1,"I did not like this album one bit, or one song.  I had a hard time listening to it all the way through.  I certainly would never listen to it a second time.  Affected and pretentious.  Miss Fleming has a beautiful voice, but not here.  The songs that were not ugly to begin with, ended up that way.  So far I have ""standard"" albums from Kiri, Dawn, and now Renee, please ladies let's have no more of this, it doesn't work. "
4,"This release is a great one.  However it does not compare with the original ""Dear Diary, My Teenage Angst has a Bodycount""  It seem almost all of the tracks are filler tracks and the entire album must have been spit out at the last minute.  That being said the band From First To Last is still very talented both musicaly and lyricly. "
1,"What is this compilation have to do with anything?  These are a bunch of essential songs with a few remixes that are already on other CD's! GOLD?  Where in the hell is the platinum collection at?  I was hoping to fine more rare remixes from the artists listed on this CD, instead of nothing.  HIP-O records should be more focused than the efforts of this project.  What about the other Eric B & Rakim expanded projects (UNCUT, please,unlike the GOLD album they did for them...) Uptown Records Compilation re-release, Marley Marl's first jams on MCA... who's with me on this?  Even better, how about helping with BEP to stop selling out and making quality Hip Hop music again.  I suggest some real crate-diggers for the HIP-O staff in the future because this CD is a redicule of hip hop music, and they're not doing jackbone for r&b either!  I got one name for that: SWITCH's full-length albums on CD!  Hip-O and MCA/Geffen/Universal, if you're not going to at least make up you minds what name to use to lead the company, stop keeping the people waiting for quality products. I will not buy this so-called Hip Hop GOLD CD because it's junk! "
4,"This is a very fun album.  Of course ""Jukebox"" makes you want to dance no matter where you are. But if you only listen to the singles you are doing yourself a disfavor.  Bent Fabric has really crafted an album and you will be rewarded for listening to it front to back.  The only reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because the album is pretty short. Even with it being padded out with a few remixes (which are good and appreciated) this runs under 60 minutes. On the other hand its refreshing to just get the good stuff and not have to flip past padding tracks.  Don't get me wrong, this album is worth your money, especially if you are a fan of dance/DJ music. Very fun and a great party album you can throw on and leave play without worring about bad tracks ruining the vibe"
5,"I was looking for arrangements of many traditional Christmas carols done by orchestras.  This album hits the spot.  It is not uniquely orchestra carols, the Canadian Brass is mixed in as welll.  The highlight of the album for me is the back to back track of &quot;Sleigh Ride&quot; pieces.  It begins with W.A. Mozart's &quot;Sleigh Ride,&quot; followed by Leopold Mozart's piece of the same name, and then finnished with the ever popular arangement of &quot;Sleigh Ride&quot; by Anderson.  It is a really good mix of carols, and can be listened to for hours"
2,"I first heard word of the track &quot;Fly&quot; in a review of Arf! Arf! Records' &quot;A Heavy Dose of Lite Psych&quot; compilation in Mojo magazine. The reviewer vowed that this track was worth the price of admission by itself, everything else was bonus. I was intrigued by the description of &quot;what Radiohead may have sounded like in the Summer of Love&quot;. Receiving the compilation CD, I immediately listened to this track and completely fell in love with it. When I heard the album had been re-released, I jumped at the chance to buy it. I have to admit I set myself up for disappointment. The only other tracks that come close to comparing are &quot;Land of Sensations and Delights&quot; (little more than two minutes), &quot;Christine&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot;. None of these tracks can match &quot;Fly&quot;, however, and many of the others sound like Jay forgot to write the rest of the song (like the last track on side 1, &quot;Nobody&quot;, if I remember correctly). It's still interesting, but I would not rate it as five stars. I'm hoping I'm not misled with Aerovons and Gandalf (both of which I'm getting ready to buy, and comparisons to the Beatles and the Zombies are enjolling me to buy these)"
4,There might be 2 clunkers on this disc but most of it is quite enjoyable.  For power-pop fans that might enjoy Christmas tunes.  Not necessarily for Christmas fans that might enjoy power-pop.  4.5 stars
2,"MTV Unplugged 1 was a great album, that blended very well. Unplugged two just misses as a combination of songs"
1,I agree with others This CD has been very badly put together. The sound is harsh. I thought there was something wrong with my Hi-Fi. It is such a shame as we've been waiting so long and Jon's music is so brilliant. I don't know if anyone else has noticed too but the title track fades out too quickly.
1,"Well iv read through a few reviews now, some good, some totaly wierd and none understanding, some dont know what they'v even on about but i read the review by G FUNKINN which i think is 3rd down. im a huge tupac fan and will defend his reputation if anyone dare try portray him as something other then a true hip-hop legend.  i was realy looking forward to writing this review about this great album as it's easly one of my best if not my best, but i was so shocked to see some write such a detailed review on this album (someone love's this album as much as me) G FUNKINN you'v done a brilliant job on reviewing this album and made me want to buy another copy incase anything happened to the one iv got.. .. ..   i'd just like to add what the story line of the best song on the album ""tear drops and closed caskets""   the song is so well writen when listening to it your mind fallows the song and make you feel like your reading a book due to the way the songs writen, after its finished it makes you feel like after you have just watched a realy good film and you get that feeling inside that make you feel like what you'v just watch is actualy one of your own memories ( not mean that you have had happen to you what the songs lyrics are about but more that it's such a graphic song) the rhyming of the word is nearly unbelievable. you do tend to hear the same thing been rhymed alot in songs ie: im a G from CPT and other things that ryhme with G or E, but not in this song  the song start's by intruducing the 3 mean characters which are two friends called little moe and little trigga and a woman called little precious. it tells you how prcious is a getto girl and wont even bother with you unless you have a nice car and money, litle trigga's heart broken by the fact he's got no money and he want precious to be with him. so he meets up with his best friend little moe and plot to kill the two neibourgh hood deals and steal there drugs and money. they complete there mission and little trigga is seen as a big time man of the getto.  in the second vurse it goes on to tell you how precious and trigga are together and have a baby on the way but little known to trigga but his best friend lil moe has been seeing precious and it would apear that them two are togeher, after people see both precious and moe together start talking and trigga finds out.   3rd vurse goes on to say that now moe and trig are now enemys and precious is to doped up on drugs not to notice, the song ends with the lyrics. "" small time dealing to selling keys, i cant believe the sh** there telling me, they opened fire 3 bodys dropped so call the cops, precious little moe and trig, tear drops and closed caskets"".   the way the stories is told  is as if tupac and the outlaws are rapping to each other about the stories as if it happened and they had heard about it.      In the other views people have said that the outlawz have spoiled this album but i strongly disacree with these comment. the outlawz when i first heard this album i felt the same way and thought the outlawz maded this album not as good as it could of been but after a few years of owning the album you start too realise what the outlawz are saying, too the commen listener poeple do tend to get hook up in the beat and with tupac been on the album alot of people only start properly listening when pac starts speaking.      after owning the album for some time i started to notice the outlawz and although there lyrics can be spitted out in a fast and sometimes non-understandible style people dont actualy hear the words, if you do buy this album please dont just listen to pacs word but also listen to the outlawz because true listeners with a good ear for proper hiphop will notice the talent and lyricial skill of the outlawz and infact in a few song i find that they are very much on the same level as pac.  what more can i say. if you dont buy the album please down load the song tear dropz and close caskets  i actualy rate this 5 stars im not sure why it's only put a 1 star rating? ? ?  "
2,"Being an avid enthusiast of the drum n' bass &quot;scene,&quot; as pretentious as it occasionally sometimes is, in listening to this Cd I feel this is not a strong representation of the genre. This could very well be  personal, (so you headz chill) but this type of jazzy, tech-step like, a  cappella jam seems occasionally cheesy and filled  with..well...&quot;filler.&quot;  I realize that during 1998 this was where  it was at for Grooverider. He was hardly setting off bombs in the d n b  fabric with other producers overshadowing his less-than-fresh efforts.   This album has a few choice cuts, and his production skills are  commendable, but combining so-called jazz harmonies with this type of genre  is definately an abuse of power.  The loungy progressions are worn thick,  and lacking any true creativity deep down.  This album comes nowhere near  stuff on the &quot;Prototype Years&quot; ep which was showcasing the fine  talents of heavy hitters Dillinja, Ed Rush, Fierce, Lemon D, Optical, and  Boymerang, to name a few.  It goes without saying that Grooverider has been  one of the most respected and talented DJ's, probably getting all of these  afforementioned producers their starts.  A big name gets alot of support   and can get away unscathed by negativity due to that stardom.  No one would  dare defy that Grooverider's attempt at making d n b is off key, but let's  not give in to someone's production skills because they are graciously  empowered in the scene like a king.  Purveyor's of fine drum n' bass can  find sanctuary elsewhere.  Stick with your records for the best"
5,"Though I am not a fan of pop music, the beauty of Ofra Haza's voice lured me in.  This album has wonderful songs in an almost 80s-style pop music with ""middle eastern"" influence.  The lyrics are moving and deeper than typical pop music, complete with a voice that is unique to just about any genre"
1,"This doesn't include Rude Mood in either studio or live version, Travis Walk, Riviera Paradise, or any of his other unbelievable instrumental guitar workouts.  This compilation is a serious waste of money.  Virtually any album he put out would be better by itself than this compilation, especially Texas Flood or In Step.  Better yet by far, though, would be to get ""The Essential Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble.""  It's bargain priced, and contains every song you could want or expect, including the excellent, posthumously-released acoustic blues song, ""Life By The Drop.""  SRV is a guitarist worth discovering, but this compilation won't show you anything"
5,The interweaving of blues into Bach is incredible.  What is most gratifying is that Bach is very much present in this very smooth CD.  Highly recommend
4,"Keith Sweat made this lesser-known, underrated album with some of R&amp;Bs most beautiful songs like &quot;Why Me, Baby?&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Love You Down&quot;, &quot;There You Go&quot;, &quot;Give Me What I Want&quot;, &quot;The 10 Commandments of Love&quot; &amp; even the &quot;Keep it Comin&quot; remix. The first side of this tape is filled with fast songs &amp; one love song. The fast songs are terrible. At the same time, this album is better than &quot;I'll Give All My Love To You&quot;. Keith didn't get as good as his first album until his fifth album"
4,"This is a great comedy CD.  Sabes que I BARELY GOT IT.  I heard it was very funny, but it didn't interest me that much.  I finally bought it and thought it was very funny.  It is a must have from George Lopez's fans.  I can relate to many of the things he mentions, which makes everything even more hilarious. Recomended"
5,"THIS IS TRADITIONAL COUNTRY MUSIC AT ITS VERY BEST. THERE ARE GREAT FEMALE/MALE DUOS TODAY, BUT PORTER AND DOLLY CAN REALLY PUT ALL THE EMOTION THAT THE SONGS ON THIS CD REQUIRE. WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND"
4,"I must admit that I have never been a Boyzone fan and quite fankly I found Ronan's solo efforts rather dull, so when a friend lent me a copy of Boyzone member Stephen Gately's debut solo CD I was rather skeptical. I was pleasantly surprised. This CD is filled with wonderful pop sounds and Stephen's sweet singing voice is used to full effect here. With several tracks cowritten by Stephen himself, the lyrics are basically dealing with his coming-out. A wonderful CD - I throughly recommend it"
1,"When Britney Spear's first album came out called Oops! I Did It Again, I thought she had talent. But when My Perogative came out, I'm like, ""Where she at? That's sooo NOT BRITNEY SPEARS!!"" I couldn't believe it!! And her music videos from the CD, uggh!! I want da REAL Britney back!!!"
5,"After scoring their first number one album, The Heat Is On, The Isley Brothers' followed that classic up less than a year later with 1976's amazing Harvest For The World.  The band has always had something to say and never have they said more than on the amazing title track.  A call for understanding and unity, the song has more relevance today than it did twenty-five years ago.  The album is worth it for that song alone, but the rest of the album stands up as well with &quot;People Of Today&quot;, &quot;Let Me Down Easy&quot; and &quot;At Your Best (You Are Love)&quot; standing out.  The album peaked at number nine on the charts"
4,"Queensryche was never a band to sit still-- from their early metal roots on their first couple releases, the band began blending elements of progressive rock and other influences into their sound until ""Promised Land"".  In many ways a pinnacle acheivement in the band's history, it would have been extremely difficult to equal.  The album was well constructed, an acheivement of arranging and sound, and while it was unpopular with a number of the band's fans (who would have preferred a straight metal sound), it was certainly a unique statement.  Many bands would have been tempted to try for a sequel in sound and feel, others would have tried to get even more over the top, still even more would be likely to retreat backwards, to rejoin the metal sounds of their youth.  Queensryche did something quite different.  ""Hear in the Now Frontier"" is a stripped done, bare record.  Gone are the swirling arrangements, the extra instruments, keyboards, synths, samples, layered vocal harmonies, etc.  Instead, straightforward riffing, blistering leads, and a looseness bleed forth, as though the band had been listening to what the other locals in Seattle were doing.  When I first heard the record, I hated it (even as a fan of the grunge movement that in many ways inspired it), but there was enough decent material to keep me coming back to it.  These days I love it.  In truth, I think it represents guitarist Chris DeGarmo's waning interest in metal-- he exited the band shortly after and ended up playing guitar with Jerry Cantrell for a while, and his stamp is all over this-- 12 of the 13 cuts on the record were written or cowritten by him, and the best material (that which looks back as little as possible) was soley from his voice.  From opener ""Sign of the Times"", with its sludgy rhythm guitars and wobbly lead, its clear this is something different.  The best material on the record tends to be the less heavy work-- from the laid back ballad ""Some People Fly"" to swirling love song ""You"" to the brilliant and soporific ""Hero"".  DeGarmo even takes the mic from vocalist Geoff Tate on great love song ""All I Want"", and while some of the heavier and more abstract material also works well (""Saved"", the bizarre fan-favorite ""sp00L""), its really an album that excels in the midtempo pieces.  The remaster is further augmented with b-side ""Chasing Blue Sky"" (a relatively uninteresting piece) and three recordings from the MTV unplugged show several years beforehand-- ""Silent Lucidity"" and ""I Will Remember"" get decent readings, but its really ""The Killing Words"" that is noteworthy-- its a fantastic and delicate performance of a great song.  It doesn't sound like old Queensryche, but that's what I love about the band.  They'd reach higher heights, but there's an awful lot of great material on here that deserves listening.  Careful and patient listening will yield rewards"
1,Pink Floyd is my favorite group of all time and a few hours ago I heard the Scissor Sisters do a cover of Comforably Numb on Saturday Night Live. It was the worst song I have ever heard. The Scissor Sistors are walking on ground they should'nt be walking on. The song was so bad that it took me a minute to figure out they were accually playing Comfortably Numb. I hope the Scissor Sisters are happy because they made a mockery of one of the greatest rock songs of all time
2,"I can't believe the 5 star reviews this album gets.  (Well, it probably deserves it more than Yoko Ono and Syd Barrett's albums, which also get mostly 5 stars.)  ""Golden Years"" is an excellent track, one of Bowie's best (wa-wa-wa)..  The title track is pretty catchy too.  But the rest of it is just depressing, dull songs with little of the originality that marked his Hunky Dory/ Ziggy / Aladdin Sane era.  He just ran out of ideas I guess.  I can believe he doesn't remember making this album - he sounds detached and bored with it all.  I've never considered David Bowie a GREAT vocalist, it's a testament to the quality of his Ziggy-era songs that you don't notice his vocals are a bit thin and weak, and need lots of echo and studio effects to thicken them up.  And the songs on this album are more vehicles for an accomplished vocalist than a simple singer-songwriter.  I'll give him credit for improving his voice and learning good singing techniques - the vocals here are certainly more accomplished than those on his earlier albums.  But it's not enough to save this lot of songs.  I guess it all depends on what matters more to you, the quality of the song itself, or the vocalist's ability.  If you like the first, get Ziggy Stardust.  If the latter matters more, get this album."
2,If you were waiting for Ministry of Sound to ruin Hed Kandi well then here it is.  Thankfully I haven't brought this.  After hearing this compilation it is very clear that Hed Kandi is over.  The only CD that's any good is the 3rd one and that's cause it's full of Hed Kandi classic's which I've already herd a million times....  Don't waste your money.  If you've already brought any Ministry of Sound CD's this year then don't bother cause if you haven't grown sick of hearing the same tracks from the last year on radio then you will be after hearing this.  Reserve your listening time for something worth while.  Quality isn't a word I'd use to discribe this compilation at all..
2,Stick with the 2002 and 2003 CD's. This one lacks the kick of the others and the chosen songs don't flow well
5,"I find the music of Oscar Lopez in this CD to meet all my expectations and I would highly recommend this purchase to those seeking the music of an accoustical latino guitarist  This was my first selection by Oscar Lopez, but I have no doubt it will not be my last.  He is very talented and his music is very rewarding"
5,Attempting to construct a solid soundtrack to a movie is also detrimental to the success of the movie as all contributing artists must put forth their best work.  Babyface has written and or co-written this entire LP which he has also produced with a touch of emotion from a woman's perspective.  As all of the work consists of heavy hitters there isn't any room for change as each individually could be singles in their own rights.  More so relationship driven from heartache this has everything you may be looking for in an all woman release including pop and R&B
4,"A must for lovers of bluegrass guitar and banjo pickin' by three of America's greatest musicians. Some classic stuff and, thankfully, some pieces I'd never heard.  Very high quality recording.  Unfortunately, there's only 11 cuts and I could listen for hours"
5,"by far the best dieselboy cd yet.  the selection is really nice and the mixing is transparent.  if you like your music dark *and* jazzy, this is a perfect buy"
2,"This album shows sadly that Nancy has lost her pipes, albeit ever so slowly. She misses as many as she hits. The arrangements are good and the surrounding cast is excellent with Bob Mintzer, James Moody , Tom Scott and many others and the artwork is superb! She looks great in the photos, and maybe that's good enough reason to buy it. But the singing is poor and her choice of numbers isn't so great either. I suspect that if she would keep it light and moving along at a faster swing-type tempo, as say Sinatra did at the end, she would sound better. Still a very classy lady though. "
1,"I can't even begin to describe how much this band sucks.  Suffice it to say that you will probably enjoy this cd if you are a fan of talentless nu-metal bands like Staind and Taproot.  I bought this because I was trying to find a new band in the same vein as 90s crunch masters like Helmet and Quicksand, but I was severely disappointed.  This is a cd for people who like their music simplistic, plodding, one-dimensional, and repetitive.  Wonder what's next?--How about another song just as bad as the one that preceded it!  After the third song of lifeless droning, it just becomes annoying as the torment continues unabated.  I've listened to this cd several times in an attempt to understand what so many others like about it, but I've concluded that I won't be able to fully appreciate this band until I can learn to fall asleep and puke at the same time"
1,I suppose you will enjoy this if you really like Yo-Yo Ma at his most boring.  This is glorified elevator music and about as interesting
5,"I have had this videocassette for years and its so worn I'm so glad to finally get a CD!  Jewel's voice is beautiful and some of the classics like Joy to the World and O Little Town of Bethlehem are the best versions I have ever heard.  I could have done without the non-traditional songs which don't quite fit into the holiday arrangement or match the beauty of her voice but its well worth the purchase for Gloria, O Holy Night and Ave Maria. If you like to sing along, I highly recommend it."
2,before you buy this poor cd you have to buy cathedral-&quot;forest of equilibrium&quot; and winter -&quot;into darkness&quot; which are what this band is trying to be .be wise .smoke a lot.know what good music is
5,This is better than the album by far. All the mixes keep you craving their best song
1,"Puddle of Mudd exploded into the contemporary pop/rock scene around 2000.  This album is representative of their entire catalogue.  For those music fans who want to hear true hard rock, pick up a good copy of any early Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath.  For anyone wanting true grunge, pick up any copy of an Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, or Nirvana album.  Puddle of Mudd shamelessly (and inaccurately) self-promotes their band/sound as both hard-rock and grunge, while living up to neither.  Since most of their fans seem to be pretty young, they've been able to pull this sham off, mainly because their audience has never been exposed to any of the aforementioned bands...and honestly has no desire to listen to any older music.  The songs on this album are extremely redundant, with little variation of riffs or overall aesthetics from one track to the next.  The lyrics are horribly compiled to offer nothing more than a vocal rhythm and subpar content.  This album is a waste of both time and money for anyone interested in listening to any worthwhile rock"
5,"The Flamingos are my all-time favorite group ever. Extraordinary harmonies, impeccable timing, and intricate arrangements characterize every beautiful recording by this amazing world-class group. The Flamingos have a unique and timeless sound which has often been emulated but never duplicated, and most likely never will.  They have left an enduring legacy of music for millions of people to enjoy. May God bless them all"
4,a good cd but if your looking for a god version of these songs you must! absolutly have to hear the studio versions on the other albums. but this is a must have for the hardcore fan
1,"yeah....this cd bit.  i bought chillout sessions 4 last year, and looked forward to buying this compilation as well.  unfortunately, it didn't live up to the last one.  out of the 20 or so tracks on the first cd, i liked 2-3...and they were all on other compilations i already own.  the same was true for the second cd.  this was not worth the money.  i was very disappointed"
2,"To the person that mentioned Jim Steinman's lack of involvement with the album, I agree. Without the genius' magic touch, Meat loaf has come out with an awfully shabby album. The title song ""Couldn't have said it betterr myself"" offers a slight zing to the album. But when listening to the rest of the album, it is very disappointing. Steinman and Meat Loaf are the ultimate duo. But when one is taken away, it is noticeable. I would not reccommend this album"
1,"If you want a greatest hits package from Reba McEntire, get her first or her second one.  This one contains mostly pop tripe from when she all but abandoned country music to ""do what sells"".  This collection is phony...just like the lady herself. "
2,"This sounds more like a &quot;country gospel quartet&quot; collection.  For a much better bluegrass collection, try Rounder's &quot;25 Years of Bluegrass.&quot;   Much better gospel bluegrass CD's are Ricky Skaggs' &quot;Soldier of the Cross&quot; and The Isaacs' &quot;Increase My Faith&quot; or &quot;Pieces of Our Past.&quot"
1,this little white janet jackson wannabe is a total sellout and trailer trash with nasly moans for a voice and stiff dancing. And yet 70 million losers bought her records
5,"What can I say?  Rachelle Ferrell, Miki Howard, Deniece Williams, and Me'lissa Morgan are excellent, but this woman is the master!! None of Anita Baker's albums will disappointment, but this, I think, is the best she has to offer.  More than so on this album doe the music complement one of the beautiful voices God has ever blessed anyone with.  My favorites are More Than You Know, Fairy Tales, and Lonely"
5,"This is an excellent debut from Mindy. Her voice is beautiful and each song on here is good. &quot;Guys do it all the time&quot; is a fun slap in the face for all those &quot;macho&quot; types out there, the title song is my favourite though, but all are good, from the love songs to the fun songs. I hope she stays true to her roots though, and doesn't go the way of Leann Rimes and Faith Hill. One thing I have never understood though, is why nearly all country cds are limited to 10 tracks. This one for example is only 35 minutes long. Rock and pop cds quite often exceed 12 songs but country albums rarely even exceed 10. Anyway, thats just an observation, and doesn't take away from the worth of this album. Recommended"
1,I have been waiting for this cd for a while and I must say it was a complete disapointment for me.I am a devoted fan and I must say this production is not even close to the previous cd's.The songs are too bland and the quality of the compositions is very poor and flat.Overall a bad cd
5,"Most artists or groups suffer the notorious sophmore flop. (1st Lp off the hook, second not even close) However, I felt like they've improved off their first release. Beatwise this is one of the most head-noddin albums they've dropped. Production was flawless. Lyrics seem to have improved as well. Go cop this and support quality hip hop music. A+"
2,This is a compilation of many different styles;  look Yo-Yo can play bluegrass!  Not really &quot;Classic&quot; Yo-Yo
1,THIS BAND HAS IS ASSOCIATED WITH SUNNCOMM.  Sunncomm protects the content on a cd so it cannot be copied.  DO NOT SUPPORT BANDS THAT SUPPORT UNLAWFUL SURVILLVEILLANCE
1,"I made fun of my best friend so badly when he bought it. Honestly, I gave it a chance. We opened it and listened to it for the first time together. But halfway through the worst remix ever crafted by man, it was clear, that I would be making fun of him for his poor purchasing decision, for months to come. This is the worst remix every created. It is long and drawn out and has no merit or quality to it. Don't fool yourself into buying something you will never listen to and will hide from your friends"
5,"It is not always wise to revisit old loves, because nostalgia can be treacherous.  But not this time.  As an adolescent in the 60s, I, like many of my peers, fell in love with Dusty Springfield.  Forty years later, I listened to this collection, and I am in love with her all over again, only more so.  Her voice was very special.  From the country-style folk of The Springfields, through the romantic standards, to soulful R&B, she could do it all, and all exquisitely.  There are nuances to her singing and a depth of emotion to her voice that I missed first time round.  Listen to the unique phrasing on The Son of a Preacher Man, a song that she made her own, and the delicious seductiveness of Breakfast in Bed (which I heard for the first time on this CD) and you will see what I mean.  Her life had tragedy in it.  In many ways, the sixties were not as permissive as you might think and the British tabloid press were vicious when they caught the rumor that Dusty was a lesbian.  This helped destroy her UK career and after that she spent most of her time in the US and the Netherlands.  By nature insecure, she could not come to terms with her relative loss of celebrity and resorted to drug and alcohol abuse and even a suicide attempt.  Just when she was making a comeback following her collaboration with The Pet Shop Boys and an appearance on the Jools Holland TV show (what a hero that man is; when are we going to have his show highlights on DVD?) she was diagnosed with breast cancer, which ultimately killed her.  Among the divas of twentieth century British popular music, she is supreme, and was one of the very few to achieve real success in the US also.  It was good to hear The Look of Love on the Catch Me If You Can soundtrack.  It will help keep her voice alive for a new generation.  That track is on this CD and is just one gem among many.  They repay close listening. "
2,"From the live disc, Astronomy Domine is the strongest selection but is marred by a poor original recording and thoughtless transfer to disc.  The bass track is almost nonexistent robbing this song of its thunder. The other three tracks are good, not great, performances of what are perhaps their first important post-Syd Barret compositions.  They are definitely not the band they used to be. The studio disc is a mess.  The first part of David Gilmour's suite is the best bit, some nice blues guitar.  Like disc one, disc two sounds muddy. My overall impression is that the band was in the process of just starting to grow out of their psychedelic jam band britches but hadn't yet figured out what to put on next. Live disc=3 stars; Studio disc=1 star; Net rating=2 stars"
1,"I enjoy the band Cracker and have no issues with their releases. I just wanted to make a note to potential buyers, if you are buying used DO NOT use the Amazon seller doolicity. I have ordered from them several times and EVERY SINGLE TIME they come in as THE SLOWEST of all sellers!!! I won't endorse who I think is good but I just left the 10th negative feedback for doolicity and hope I can save many frustration when buying CD's from artist"
5,"I bought this Cd without ever having listened to a single note of the band's work.  I had read a review in Sound and Vision, then the views here at Amazon, and I took a chance.  I was not disappointed.  Every song here is an absolute gem.  The harmonies are magical, and the instrumentation will transport you.  I play this disk again and again, and I think my wife is going to hide the CD if I play it at dinnertime once more.  I promise you will not be disappointed.  Buy this disk, and simply enjoy; it's magic, gorgeous, and worth any price"
5,"Clear, sweet voices are the main attraction of this CD, with well-chosen male guests to sing those songs best delivered in a masculine voice, like &quot;Bonny Blue-Eyed Nancy&quot; and &quot;Queen of Connemara.&quot;  The selections range from lively reels and jigs and the tongue-twisting (well, maybe not if you're Celtic) &quot;An Poc Ar Buile&quot; to the haunting &quot;Broom of the Cowdenknowes,&quot; &quot;Down by the Glenside,&quot; and my favorite, &quot;Erin Gra Mo Chroi.&quot;  This is another new-to-me group that I plan to collect more of"
1,"There is no song worse to me than ""Everybody Loves Somebody Sometime"" and that one dud spoiled it for me.  I hate that song so much.    The others are okay, but this one dud - that is the one song I never want to hear nor would I ever inflict it on anybody.  It's heinous."
5,"I alway knew that Dean was a great camidian, but I wanted to find a collection of his greatest hits in song. I found it here on this disc. Dean had a great voice. No wonder the olive garden plays him so much in the background. I can even see why Regis Philbin plays him constantly in his office. This is a great disc to listen to. I did not grow up listening to this music, but over the last few years the music grew on m"
4,I do not have many Kenny Loggins CD's. I bought the &quot;Essentials&quot; CD's and then found out about this one.  I am really enjoying this CD.  The songs &quot;fit&quot; into my playlists whether I am playing only Kenny Loggins music or playing other Artists as well.  It is always good when I can mesh the music with my mood.  So far I have been able to pull out this CD and find something that matched.  I would have liked a few more songs
5,"linda rondstat has shown us once again what real popular music is all about. the songs on this cd have great melodies, lyrics, & production value. thanks linda. we who appreciate the standards owe you a large debt of gratitude"
4,"If you are a true Alanis fan, the first rule is you must own everything she has done. Second is you must love everything she has done! This is a must for any collection to enjoy for years to come"
4,"Audio Disc Breakdown:  1. FEAR OF BLISS - Some trippy rock from Alanis! This track doesn't follow Alanis' standard songwriting formula and is a bit scattered. Nonetheless, a great song. 4/5  2. BENT FOR YOU - Excellent alt/rock effort. This is the song that opens the DVD portion of ""Feast On Scraps"". Excellent. 5/5  3. SORRY TO MYSELF - This is a spine tingling ballad. Perhaps, dare I say, Alanis' best ballad. This song definitely should have been released as a single. 5/5  4. SISTER BLISTER - This one's a monster rocker! As well as the previous track, this would have been so successful as a single. Not since ""You Oughta Know"" has Alanis produced such a great rock track. Would have been a huge hit on the Modern Rock Charts. 5/5  5. OFFER - Another ballad here, however, this one falls incredibly short. While Alanis' voice is good, nothing seems to come together and the lyrics and music are to say the least, boring. 2/5  6. UNPRODIGAL DAUGHTER - Another great rock track. It's about Alanis leaving home for L.A. to start her new life. We see a hint of the ""angry"" Alanis we say on ""Jagged Little Pill"", maybe because this song is referring back to that time. 5/5  7. SIMPLE TOGETHER - I believe this song was the song sent to radio stations to promote ""Feast On Scraps"". It most definitely was a poor choice. While it is an ok ballad, it's somewhat dull. 3/5  8. PURGATORYING - This song is magical! It's a very enjoyable and definitely interesting song. There's almost an otherworldly feel to this. From watching this song being performed on the DVD of ""Feast On Scraps"", it's easy to see the magic of this track comes from the live performance. Nonetheless, great! 4/5  9. HANDS CLEAN(ACOUSTIC) - It's really nice to hear this 2002 hit stripped down to the core. Sounds great. 4/5  DVD Overview:  The full concert on this DVD follows Alanis though her 2002 ""Toward Our Union Mended Tour"" Most of the footage is from her Rotterdam show. It's loaded with hits, precious rarities and brand new tracks! Alanis has such raw, pure energy in her shows. Most notibly on tracks such as ""Purgatorying"", ""You Oughta Know"", ""Flinch"", ""Sympathetic Character"" and ""Uninvited"". This DVD shows us at times the rewarding and struggling process of songwriting in and out of the studio. Contains superb behind the scenes footage showing us Alanis' humorous and wacky side. It's also an excellent facet to understand her and her philosophy to a much greatest extent. 5/5  Overall:   I actually rate this album 4.2 out of 5 stars. ""Feast On Scraps"" is a great experience for any lover of live music! A great buy!"
5,"I believe this was one of their strongest and smoothest CD's they ever put out. Fourplay is one of Smooth Jazz's best supergroups. I have worn out this CD along with ""Elixir"", which is the next best one in my opinion. ""Yes, Please"" was the last CD before ""Heartfelt"". Although Heartfelt was good, it seemed like they are going in a different direction. I just previewed ""Journey"" and I have to say that i most likely won't be buying the CD, I'll just buy certain songs. If you want the definitive Fourplay collection, get every one of their CD's from the self titled debut to Yes, Please. You might even pick up ""Heartfelt"". If you want one of their best CD's, get ""Yes, Please""!!"
5,"First of all, I am not a classical critic, and second of all, I have heard a lot of music in my time and this set takes the cake for the best of class. This music of Samuel Barber preformed by the New Choir of Oxford College exemplifies the title of this CD, Having not purchased the CD and just listening to the sample tracks available, I am sure I have not experienced it all. But, I urge you to buy this CD and to listen to it in it's fullest extent"
5,"Jeff Golub and his crew have got a relaxed and polished style- in the light jazz vein of say Bob James or the &quot;Crusaders&quot; They move from funky tunes, thru  soulful ballads and on to rousing infectious  uptempo grooves. This is really enjoyable instrumental work, familar but  never hackneyed. The musicianship is exemplary, tight and inspired  throughout. I'd put this disc in my top ten of the past three years- highly  reccomended"
1,Mambo #5 caught my ear when listening to the car radio.  It is the only passable song on the CD.  I couldn't even listen all the way through the others.  Just awful.  I paid one cent plus shipping for it used and still feel ripped off by Mr. Bega.
2,"""Things Falling Apart"" is the remix album that followed ""The Fragile"", and is remixes of material from that record.  After the high standard set by ""Further Down the Spiral"", I had lofty expectations, and that could be effecting my opinion of this one, I largely found that this album falls short of its predecessor in all ways.  It could be the choice of material-- largely sticking to the song forms, I think the remixers missed an opportunity to really place with something atmospheric and create something unique-- I mean, did we really need three versions of ""Starf***ers, Inc""?  I find the original to be subpar, and remixing a weak song isn't going to produce a strong one, regardless of the efforts Sherwood, Oglivie, and Clouser put into their remixes.  Ditto for Hillibrandt's take on ""The Wretched""-- its not one of the stronger pieces on the record.  And where's the remixes of ""We're In This Together"" or instrumentals like ""Just Like You Imagined"" or ""Complication""?  This material has a depth and detail to it that suggest it could well receive a remix.  Now mind you, its not all bad on here, Reznor and Moulder's reconstruction, ""The Great Collapse"" (pulling in samples from at least a couple songs and layering them on top of a good beat) is very listenable, Benelli's remix of ""The Frail"" as a string piece may surpass the original in terms of delicate beauty, and the cover of Gary Numan's ""Metal"" is fantastic.  But overall, this is somewhat of a weak effort"
5,This is an excellent CD!  I honestly can't listen to the CD enough.  I've had friends listen to the CD who aren't even interested in any sort of Celtic or instrumental music and they also raved over it.  McGoldrick needs to put out another one
5,"This is an excellent CD with the wonderful music of Rampal's flute and Laskine's harp, a perfect and unique match. Whereas the CD contains many beautiful works, there are three that are sublime and deserve mention.   ""Nambu Ushioi Uta"" a Japanese folksong is a unique work as the sad willow melody is pierced by sharp flute interruptions, like an obstinate sparrow continually breaking the silence of melancholy. The piece tip-toes like an elegant silk veil floating on a branch over a night garden.  With its broken pacing, the melodies remain sad and reflective, but always interrupted by the pesty bird chirp, like a crocus on a dark mid-winter morning.  ""Defune"", a mature echoing ghosty melody builds a sad journey of experience and time. I would listen to this song over and over, allowing it to release any grief that I harbored. There is a lilting passage that builds and allows the harp to mirror or reflect the building lilting passage established by the flute. Then the piece moves toward a resolution of quite contemplation.  The CD ends with ""Sakura Sakura"" which Rampal and Laskine play for all it is worth, starting with a minimal slow paced introduction of the melody which is no sooner established than is rendered with a pastoral interpretation of the classic tune. And as the flute wavers like a songbird, a triump of music begins to build and anchors the central presentation of the work.  Now having established and adorned this rich tapestry, Rampal and Laskine begin pulling every golden and silver thread from this whole cloth to integrate minimal repetitions of the central melody finally offered to us in atonal windstorms and durges, retaining its uncanny beauty, made even more beautiful by the lack of perfection, the final sour note.   This CD is superb in that it balances the 3 tragic pieces I describe above with 8 other works of more gaity and light. I predict that this will be one of your favorite CDs for years to come"
2,well lets be real here there are two really catchy songs and they stand out.Don't Let Me be the one &amp; of course one of the baddest and rarest Bass Jams from the 80's I Can't Wait.cuz the Synths took over at will and  sadly the music hasn't recovered
5,"I cannot state more emphatically that Sunset Rubdowns album is my pick for album of the year, not just for how surprisingly good it is to anyone that enjoyed Wolf Parade's incredible debut but because it is simply inspiring from start to finish.  As a whole this is the most delightful kind of album, the one you wish everyone's side-band would put out to keep the enthusiasm going. The fact that it will remain under almost everyone's radar is not entirely bad, as it leaves it open for discovery many, many years down the road"
1,"I have never been drunk enough to listen to this all the way through, but I have made everybody hit the door, even when there was liquor left, by putting on ""Muskrat Love.""  Perfect for the thrifty college guy that wants to keep a few beers for tomorrow, or has already hooked up for the evening and wants the dorm room to himself"
4,"To begin with, whatever else one might say about this album, it has to be acknowledged that the import price for this disc, considering that it is only 32 minutes long, makes it a somewhat overpriced EP.  Meanwhile, this somewhat forgotten quasi-gem from Alice sits comfortably between the New Wave / post-Hollywood production of ""Flush the Fashion"" and his most strongly novelty-influenced album, ""Zipper Catches Skin"".  Generally, there's a stripped down sensibility musically, and less purely goofy lyrics.  Partly, this is due to the opening ""Who Do You Think We Are,"" which presents a rather oblique look, perhaps, at special forces.  The music is very stripped down--no, extremely stripped down compared to ""Welcome to my Nightmare"" or ""Goes to Hell"" or all of his later metal albums--it's as if Alice is getting in touch with his inner garage here.  Vocally, Alice provides his usual range of dark sneers, wide-eyed irony, and generally witty lyrics.  Certainly a promising start.  ""Seven & Seven Is"" (a cover) rattles along continuously with a snare drum, with jangly distortion guitars, occasional electronic flourishes, and Alice pretty much resorting to straight-up growly voice throughout. Hard though not to like an energetic song that declares, ""Oom Beh Beh Oom Beh Beh yea.""  ""Prettiest Cop on the Block,"" as the name suggests is a transvestite policeman tale.  Definitely shot through with machismo, this is no limp-wristed rendition.  ""I got a stiff reputation with a stick like a rock. My kids are confused, and my wife is in shock."" The vocals are the growls as previously--the I've-been-drinking-and-smoking-too-much gravel kind of voice.  The music is a bit uninspired, particularly the drums. The novelty of the song wears out in fairly short order.  ""Don't Talk Old to Me"" manages to vary things musically, finally. A fairly deft combination of kind of heavy-handed guitar and lyrics set next to a chorus that features keyboards and a number of layered dialoguing vocal lines.  The lyrics, of course, have a certain cleverness as an adult obviously complains about being told to give up all his toys, such as guns and cars.  There are more musical details and variation in this song than the previous ones--the particular combination of comedy and seriousness here is pretty convincing.  ""Generation Landslide `81"" is a reprise of the lyrically excellent tune from ""Billion Dollar Babies"" (the tune, in fact, that gives us the phrase ""billion dollar babies""). A military-march style snare kicks along, as simple guitar chords back up Alice's cultural rant, and adds a verse or two to the original.  One of the effects of this song is to point out some of the less inspired aspects of the rest of the disc, but that doesn't mean one isn't glad for it being here. Energetic, socially incisive Alice.  ""You Want It, You Got It"" let's out Alice's inner used car salesman, as he vocally sleazes his way through this either brilliant send up of the worst of New Wave music, or a rather unfortunate example of it. Cheesy keyboards and ham-fisted drum machine, many years later this song sounds so dated that it almost ceases to be dated.  If this song really tickles your fancy, then ""Zipper Catches Skin"" will be a treasure trove for you as this is definitely a prequel of that album to come.  Harmless cheese, one may not expect ""cute"" from Alice, but here you are.  ""You Look Good in Rags"" returns to a more traditional rock ensemble, guitar lead and all. This workaday rocker never really quite stands up, even with the semi-barbershop acapella section of ""rags rag rags"" toward the end, clipping scissors effect and all.  The non-stellarness of it does not mean that it's hopelessly boring. It's kind of good, harmless fun--it's just, one doesn't expect this sort of thing from Alice.  ""You're a Movie"" is a ridiculous cheeky monologue by a would be heroic general type. The music is thoroughly 80s, guitar tone and gacky keyboards all.  And, in fact, the chorus that chants, ""You're a movie"" is completely dead and unspirited. So what makes this pure novelty song ever-fresh, ever-delightful and really very funny are Alice's intercut remarks.  They say that in comedy timing is everything, and Alice shows that he's got it in spades here.  Technically a pretty awful song, one cannot help digging the wily wit Alice puts out.  The last track, ""Vicious Rumours"" provides that obligatory Alice song about public perception. The vocals here draw out the snideness more. One wishes (throughout the album) that the drums were set back more in the mix, and the guitars brought forward, but there's more energy in this particular rocker than most of the rest of the album.  So, overall one can hardly recommend this album without qualifications, especially if you are getting here by way of his first band, or by his later work, like ""Brutal Planet"".  As a kind of essay in cheese, and sheer low-fi production goofiness--and particularly of a sound that is glued immovably to the 80s--then you might enjoy this. Again, the import price is awfully steep for such a short disc.  A used copy seems a better way to go."
4,"HOME & AWAY: Norrisman has been around for quite a while, basically since the mid-nineties - enough time to put out a couple of albums as well as several bucketloads of singles - but never really made waves away from Jamaican shores until last year's appropriately titled HOME & AWAY. Ray Stephens' easy listening FLAMES rhythm provided the backdrop for this passionate, pleading love song (as well as Richie Spice's super EARTH ALERT, and Morgan Heritage's lush IN A GHETTO), which met with respectable international success, and now heads up this latest long player from the UK's Greensleeves label. Greensleeves are obviously giving the artist a well-deserved push here, with glossy packaging and great liner photos featuring Norrisman trodding the train yards with a guitar strapped across his back like a Jamaican Woody Guthrie, or something. It's a classy package for sure, and without a doubt, it's a classy record too. The familiar title track leads off, and is matched and even bettered by great cuts like SEH DEM BAD, I'M A FREE MAN, the ganja lover's HERBS TO YOUR NERVE, and the bubbling ARMAGEDDON ON. The reliable Lutan Fyah (another recent Greensleeves mover with his excellent PHANTOM WAR album) shows up for the decent combination tune, AFTER ALL, but other than that, it's all Norrisman all the way, and to his credit, he carries it off without so much as a misstep. Most of the production credit goes to Byron Murray and his In The Streetz outfit, and the backup is bright and lively throughout, with a very tangible - and very welcome -  old school one-drop vibe. The only real detour is the Delly Ranks-produced MOVE HARD on the RED BULL & GUINNESS rhythm, which just shows that Norrisman is as comfortable up at the edge of the bump as he is with the roots and lovers material. HOME & AWAY is a very strong release, and along with PHANTOM WAR, one of the best rootswise long players of the year so far.   Next up on the roots release schedule is Mr. Perfect's debut, GIDDIMANI. Look out for this one - it could be another contender!"
5,"I WENT ON MY LUNCH BREAK TO THE LOCAL RADIO STORE AS I USUALLY DO TO PURCHASE MUSIC.  I HAD BEEN MEANING TO REPLACE MY OTHER SHIRLEY MURDOCK CD'S THAT UNGRATEFUL PEOPLE REFUSED TO RETURN, BUT WHEN I SAW THE GREATEST HITS CD, I SNATCHED IT QUICK, FAST, AND IN A HURRY!!!!  IT HAD EVERYTHING!!!!!  WHEN I HEARD ""GO ON WITHOUT YOU, I WAS AT WORK, AND THE ONLY THING STOPPING ME FROM LETTING MY CO-WORKERS SAMPLE MY VOICE WAS THE FACT THAT I NEED MY MONEY!!!!!  MY EYES FILLED WITH TEARS BECAUSE MUSIC JUST DOESNT GET ANY BETTER THAN WHAT THAT SISTA DID TO ME AT THAT MOMENT!!!  I LOVE IT AND I CANT WAIT FOR THAT DRIVE HOME SO I CAN LET ALL OF HOUSTON HEAR IT.  IF YOU COLLECT OLD SCHOOL MUSIC---THIS ONE IS A MUST HAVE!!!!!!!  HOW BOUT' THAT!!!!!"
1,"It is tough to appreciate the spirit and enthusiasm that these tunes usually convey. Good song selection, but it sounds like this was recorded by a 30 piece high school band in their band room. I highly recommend going directly to your favorite college web site and purchasing their own arrangement and recording. No band can play any other school's song with the same emotion given to their own fight song"
2,"Looking at the liner photos makes clear that Falkner is the prettiest thing this side of N Sync (and doesn't he know it, especially in the shot of him being served what appears to be a large dose of Johnnie Walker Black by a leggy Bunny Flight Attendant).  Which raises the question: is this the recond a boy band member would turn out if he got the idea he was an ARTIST?  Not to put too fine an edge on it, let's say bluntly that this is a vanity project by a middling talent.  Falkner does everything on the CD and my reaction is so what?  His voice is mediocre; his lyrics are banal (&quot;Life can be just like a painting full of wonderful strangeness&quot;) or precious (&quot;Suspended on this stage of grace I have to remember this sound&quot;); the layers of sound he tracks down are just that -- layers of sound, with a disspiriting sameness song after song.  Give him two stars simply because he CAN do all the stuff on the record, but this guy needs to become a whole lot less full of himself and to spend a year or two listening to, say, Chrissie Hynde and John Hiatt CDs.  We'll let him come back then and try to write and play some adult love songs"
1,"I thought the music was dull, the lyrics uninteresting. The only song that made me want to listen to twice was the Daisy Prince piece.  The Liza Minelli song was painful"
1,"I bought this through Amazon for my older daughter when it first came out.  She tired of it after a year.  Currently, it is one of the dog's frisbee's"
2,"""The Day the World Went Away"" was the leadoff single from ""The Fragile"" and is of minimal value to all but collectors.  Two of the tracks on this are taken straight from ""The Fragile"" (with small adjustments, one's slightly shorter, one has some pointless crowd noise dubbed in), with the third (a remix) also being available on part two of the ""We're In This Together"" singles.  But looking at the songs themselves-- ""The Day The World Went Away"" is fantastic-- bleak, moody, with a great loud-soft interplay, a superb almost lacadaisical and very matter-of-fact vocal from Reznor, and a fantastic wordless vocal at the end.  The quiet mix is worthwhile, with a chant at the beginning and a delicate intro before moving the majority of the piece to a piano, in many ways it works better than the album mix, but its a bit overlong.  I'm thinking if the intro was trimmed it would work much better, the subtle reprise of the chant works nicely at the end of the piece.  ""Starf***ers, Inc"" is a rather popular song amongst fans, but I've always found it to be a bit dull-- the verses are nice enough, with a great beat, and there's some interesting guitar work on the piece, but the chorus is pure schlock and the lyrics are borderline embarassing.  Material aside, unless you're a completionist, you can skip this one"
2,The SACD recording of Derek and the Domino's Layla is a disappointment to say the least.  I have recently begun listening to several SACD and DVD-Audio recordings and this sound mix offers nothing new to the previous recordings.  This is one of rock's best offerings and the sound on this SACD offers no improvement to the mix of Eric Clapton and Duane Allman's guitar work.  A major letdown.
5,"I won't leave a long review but I felt I had to write something in support of this album. As you all know, the millineum brought some pretty bad music with it. The 1990's brought the best music in my life time when alternative hit the scene. I was born in 65.  I don't understand how the junk most stations play even gets on the airwaves. In a world that's pumping out cr@p music. It's good to see an artist giving me hope that the industry isn't totaly going down the toilet. A quick rundown: -Best song is #8  -Excellent songs are 1,4,6,9,10,11,12,13 -Song #2 and #5 are still ok -Songs 3,5,7 are just average. Overall the album has excellent flow, ie. the hit songs aren't the first on the album.  -Rivals NIN's Downward Spiral. Without a doubt the best or second best NIN album.  I hope NIN will continue. We need to purchase albums like this to show Trent R. that we appreciate his work. PS. Keep a look out for the new TOOL CD out in a few days. I've heard it(don't ask) and it is their best ever! A must buy. -R"
1,"This CD does not have the original artists performing the songs, which is all that really needs to be said about this CD.  I normally would have listened to cuts from the CD, but I don't have a sound card at work and  made the mistake of ordering it without listening to it.  Still, you  shouldn't have to read between the lines in the description to find out if  a CD with popular songs are being sung the way you like to hear it"
1,"peeps, if you want a good ministry album, try amazon.CO.UK!!  The club scene is MUCH bigger there and has the best DJ's in the world and so .co.uk has a much bigger choice of dance albums!  Check it out"
4,"YOU'RE NO GOOD,the #1 smash from this album is probably what made the album a #1 smash. There was only one other Top 20 hit,a cover of the Everly Brothers' WHEN WILL I BE LOVED. YNG came to the attention of Van Halen around 1978 and the band decided to cover the tune. The other songs are good. Linda Ronstadt's Asylum Records labelmate Andrew Gold plays guitar and sings background on YNG."
5,"I love this cd.  I watched the concert and was blown away.  There are very few things to complain about when listening to this cd.  I wish they had put the tracks on the cd in the order they appeared in the concert.  I also wish they could've done something with correcting the pitch on the Destiny's Child tracks.  It was painful to watch them doing it when the concert aired and it's worse listening to it while trying to drive. This cd is worth what you pay for it.  Where else could you get Billy Joel, Elton John, James Taylor, John Mellencamp, Paul McCartney and The Who on one cd"
5,"Syd Barrett's first solo album is very different from his work with pink floyd.It is much more haunting and sad than the whimsical ""The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn"",yet it still contains psychedelic elements. The lyrics are poignant, meaningful,and haunting.""Late Night"" ""Dark Globe""  ""Long Gone"" and ""Terrapin"" all have beutiful instrumentation and haunting lyrics.On ""No Good Trying"" and ""No Mans Land"",Barrett's madness comes through ,but in a way that adds an excellent tinge of psychedelica.""Golden Hair"" is a beutiful setting of a poem,while ""Octopus"" is a fun , invigorating, whimsical, and intriquing song.Not all is good though, it features the horrible songs ""Feel"" ""If I'ts In You"" and ""She Took A Long Cold Look"". They fall apart and they are out of tune.These hardly matter though,and this  is an excellent album with many things you woudn't expect from a crazy,drug addicted man"
2,"The Curse disc is perfect, I will say that but The Gift can be used for the following things, other than listening purposes... 1. Frisby 2. Mirror 3. Toilet paper 4. Shooting target 5. Tras"
5,"Andy C is the best DNB Dj in the land, and this mix confirms it. This mix is insane. The best tracks on the cd are Bandwagon Blues and my all-time favorite track HOTNESS. Andy C mixes so smoothly and vividly. And for most of you who have yet to hear Andy C's next Drum and Bass Arena CD; you're in for a treat. It far surpasses Nightlife. So, if you loved Nightlife, you'll be blown away by his next Drum and Bass Arena mix...Keep Ya Heads Rocki"
5,"Of the three Beatles Anthology volumes, this first one is easily the most exciting for Beatles fans and collectors.  The idea here is to give a new spin to the old classics, and present alternate takes, working versions, live renditions, all of which are being released here for the first time.    This volume takes fans back to the very beginning, to 1958's ""That'll Be The Day.""  What a thrill.  Then we hear home demos that were recorded in Paul's garage.  This is followed by the material recorded in Hamburg with Tony Sheridan.  We are treated to five selections from the Beatles' Decca Audition.  Even if it wasn't the greatest tape the Beatles could've made, I'm sure Decca is stil kicking themselves now for not signing the Beatles!    It gets better and better as time goes by.  The Beatles sang ""I'll Get You"" at the London Palladium in 1963, and ""All My Loving"" on Ed Sullivan in 1964.  Both of those recordings are presented here.  Other highlights include:  *One After 909 - I actually prefer this version to the one that got released in 1970. *Eight Days a Week - the tight harmony at the beginning works well.  Also the false starts were interesting. *How Do You Do It - the unreleased single. *Free As A Bird - a new Beatles masterpiece.  Die-hard Beatles fans will not be disappointed with this set!"
5,"This is a great Broadway soundtrack.  Mandy Patinkin has an amazing voice, and the singing is amazing.  Don't bother with the pathetic movie version"
1,"Crescent reminds me of how great a period of supreme artistry that Coltrane sustained during the last few years of his life.  I feel a need to inform all fellow lovers of this period of a little known album,currently out of print, called ""Infinity"" that truely ranks with his best. It was rescued from the vaults back in 1972 by Alice Coltrane who added a string arrangement which truely lends a mysterious quality and produces probably the most unique Coltrane recording of all time.  I first heard this album as a teenager and its mystic tones were a religious experence for me. There is something about the music that speaks of a man who knows he is near physical death and is searching for a path to eternal life.  Please note that I accidently gave ""Cresent"" a one star rating - I meant to give it five stars. "
1,"On April 26, 2005, this collection was re-released as part of the Universal Music Gold collection, at a much lower price (in Canada, anyway).  The material and mastering are fantastic, worthy of 5 stars, but the price, when compared to Gold, made me give the Anthology just one star"
2,"compared to their first 4 albums, this was a huge dissapointment, there are a few ok songs but overall it is very bland.."
2,"""BRUTAL PLANET""  REVIEW:   In Alice Cooper's long and successful career (admittedly with ups and downs along the way), he has proved (to me at least) that he is one of the best lyricist in rock and roll history. Albums like ""Love It To Death,"" ""Killer,"" ""Billion Dollar Babies,"" and ""Welcome To My Nightmare"" are just simply put - BRILLIANT. Alice was at the top of his game in the 70's. However, that is not to suggest that he's never released worthy material since then. In fact the quite opposite. Albums like his 1983 hidden gem ""Dada,"" 1991's ""Hey Stoopid"" and the brilliant ""The Last Temptation"" (1994) is amongst some of Alice's best work.  However, in the summer of 2000, Alice unleashed BRUTAL PLANET, which was produced by Bob Marlette (Union - ""The Blue Room"") and executive produced by the great Bob Ezrin. While there are standout tracks like the title track, ""Sanctuary,"" and ""Take It Like A Woman"" --- the album just falls flat. The new musical direction (Nu-Metal) seems too forced which is truly unfortunate because the album boasts some of the best lyrics Alice has ever written.   MUSICIANS:  Ryan Roxie ... Guitars Phil X ... Guitars China ... Guitars Bob Marlette ... Bass Eric Singer ... Drums  INTERESTING FACTS:  1. Released by Spitfire Records, ""Brutal"" Planet"" peaked at #193 on the Billboard Top 200.  2. There was a Japanese/Australian bonus track called ""Can't Sleep, Clowns Will Eat Me"". That title was actually inspired by dialogue spoken in the hit animated show ""The Simpsons"".  3. The stage show - which can be seen on the ""Brutally Live"" DVD - is a post-apocalyptic landscape of wreckage that also features the Frankenstein machine, a Guillotine, two TV`s - and in some cases - three TV's showing weird video footage all through out the show.   PACKAGING:  The album cover - which was created by Kane Roberts' company PlanetFX - is a decent and once again, the booklet does feature  the album's lyrics.  APPROX. RUNNING TIME:  48 min. and 4 sec.  FINAL ANALYSIS:  Musically the album just plods along and is devoid of any real energy. Despite being lyrically well-written, ""Brutal Planet"" is certainly the most disappointing release from Alice since his 1989 album, ""Trash"". **1/2 out of 5.     "
5,"I love this cd. Whenever we started to watch Nashville Star 2, I saw Brad and heard him sing, and I have liked him since then. I bought his cd yesterday, and I love all the songs on there except one. But other than that, it's a good cd. I love the song I Miss Me, when I heard him on Nashville Star singing that while he was playing the piano, I loved that song. But to anyone that kind of likes country music with a little bit of rock or pop or whatever, you will like this."
1,"In the early 1970's Rolling Stone magazine did a piece on Roy Buchanan, the late, and great, guitarist. Roy once turned down an offer to play with the Stones. Ry Cooder was nearby, overheard the interview, and began a rant about the Stones and Mick Jagger in particular. Ry was quoted saying, as I recall, that, though Keith didn't attend the ""Jamming With Edward"" session, the tape was rolling. (If memory serves, Ry said that Keith left the session, supposedly, according to Ry, in order NOT to appear to be riff hunting.)   Ry said the Stones ""stole"" his sound and riffs. He said ""Honky Tonk Woman"" was an example of this ""ripoff."" In my opinion the signature guitar riff of this tune is definitely Ry's style.  Ry also was disdainful of Mick's so called ""devil"" persona. He thought it absurd that a twerp (my word but I think I'm accurately depicting Ry's attitude towards Mick) like Mick could be considered ""satanic.""  Later, when Ry's disgust became evident to Mick and he prepared to fly back to the states, Ry said Mick asked him what was wrong and did he want more money.   I think Ry wanted less BS from Mick and company. "
2,i must say kim has a good voice but to be honest the only songs i like are crazy in the night and dont fall in love with a dreamer. rest of music is very date
5,"I really like all of Kalmahs previous releases, but they seemed to be lacking in some way; like they were on the cusp of something great but just couldnt push it over the edge. Well now they have. This is the best Melodic Death CD I have ever heard! They simply took the best elements out of every band out there and forged them into something amazing. The synth are a not so in your face version of Children of Bodom, The lead guitar harmonies are a beautiful mixture of Dark Tranquilites fast stacato riffing mixed with the violence and melody of old in Flames. The softer parts alude to my personal favorite 'Insomnium'. This has been the only cd i have been listening to for several weeks now just because there is no reason to listen to anything else. Kalman has perfected the genre! All hail."
5,"Last month I went to drop my car at my mechanics and my radio was playing the Cover Girls-Greatest Hits. My mechanic said, ""LADY YOU GOT CLASS!!! WHERE DID YOU GET THAT CD? MY WIFE ONLY LISTENS TO BRITNEY SPEARS"". I love that CD so much! It takes me back when I was a teenager at New York going to Hearthrob's, The Tunnel, Emerald City, and the Paladium. Boy!Those were the great days! I also have the collection of the FREESTYLE-Megamix. Worth buying when you are a true freestyle freak, lol"
1,"I bought this cd because ""Superstreet"" rated it so well in their magazine.  The beats are continous and boring.  If he had any skillz he should have used them for more uptempo beats.  But everyone who rated this seemed to like it so at least he has some fans outthere.  My recommendation don't buy it unless you like slow boring not even close to melodic beats how one could even dance to this is an enigma to me.  In other words i'll never buy another cd with chris fortier's name on it ever again"
5,Allele = Top Notch nu-metal/hard rock.   Easily one of the best rock records this year along side Breaking Benjamin and Flyleaf.   Worth 10 bucks. BUY!
5,"I admit, I rediscovered Spandau Ballet after hearing the song ""Gold"" over and over while playing Grand Theft Auto-Vice City in 2003.  So I bought this CD recently.  It's a very complete Spandau collection for the casual fans.  Die hard fans may find a missing song they think should be included but the major hits--""Gold,"" ""True,"" ""Communication,"" ""Chant No. 1,"" are all here.  I'm not too much feeling the black and white cover, but the booklet and interior design make the set a very impressive ""best of"" collection"
5,"I looked for awhile to find a colllection that included almost all the songs I remembered from my younger days. This CD pretty well does that. I have heard a lot of imitators over the years, but no  one has come very  close to her great style and sound"
4,"This is the second volume of recordings of songs by writers signed to the Beatles Apple Music Publishing company. Though most of the artists contributing to the CD are pretty obscure with a very limited recorded material behind them, there are a few exceptions.   The Iveys, who later changed their name to Badfinger, are represented with four mod-inspired recordings quite unlike the material they originally released the group. Though all very much time-pieces quite interesting material, with Pete Ham's ""Black and White Rainbows"" as the strongest track.   George Alexander of Grapefruit wrote two songs for the CD; none of them recordings by Grapefruit, but both among the strongest recordings on the CD.   Songwriting team Gallagher and Lyle wrote four songs; three of them their own demos. Quite obvious that they were already at that time great songwriters. The Hollies sounding tracks ""Technicolour Dream"" and ""Ivy Unrehearsed"" are my favourites.   The obscure band ""The U No Who"" who later turned into ""Bachdenkel"", deliver some of the very best recordings to the CD. Quite amazing that Apple did not offer the band a contract. Their title-track ""An Apple a Day"" is a very catchy song; their music both melodic and complex. Their other two at least as strong.   All in all a fine collection of music from the 1968-69 psychedelic years in British pop-music."
5,"You can't deny the incredible horn riffs put forth by this album, they're simply amazing.  You'll get goosebumps listening to this album for the first time.  Although at times some of the songs can become tedious, it is still one of the best jazz albums out there"
5,Ideal for anyone who likes listening to the music of Micheal Bolton or who wishes to lay a trap for a Michael Bolton fan
5,"Hank Snow is great on this CD.  He and his band found rhythm that will make you want to get up and dance with this CD.  This is a ""Happy"" CD"
5,"I've been a Randy Newman fan ""ever since there WUZ no Randy Newman,"" and so picture my delight when my very own kids bought me this boxed bonanza for Christmas (so I wouldn't have to). Randy Newman on the stereo on Christmas morning is about as Newmanesque a way to disturb the warmth of home and hearth as you can imagine. At one time or another I've owned every Newman album ever recorded, so I needed this collection like another hole in the head, but I have to recommend it as much for the surprisingly revealing biographical data as for the song selections. There are surprises here for even an old Newman trivialist like myself, and it was a relief to read of Randy's hardships as well as successes, since the dark side of this dark soul has too often been danced around in past articles and interviews. We learn that Randy's father, Irving Newman, MD, was an overbearing and cantankerous coot not above slugging it out with perfect strangers on public highways. We learn that the distracting eye condition Randy was born with, and the failed surgical attempt to correct it, may have helped to mold not only Newman's unique world view, but his discomfort with public attention. Interviewers (myself included) have generally conceded that ""Randy Newman just can't look you in the eye,"" but then, why should he when he has such a gift for cutting straight to the heart with his nostalgic sentiments and shark-attack wit. Of the many selections in this package, my standouts are his 1962 demo Golden Gridiron Boy, a delight to hear at long last since throughout Newman's career it has appeared as nothing more than a musical history anecdote. Turns out it is a quite competent version of that idiotic pop sub-genre of the '50s and early '60s when unrequited love burned teenybopping hearts alive to the accompanyment of snickering female vocal backups. Then comes Jesus in the Summertime, the highly unlikely mock spirtual that has the distinction of having been so offensive to so many ears that a session musician actually walked out of the studio rather than play on it. Now THAT's chutzpah! Personally, I like it, and find nothing offensive about it, other than the fact that it has the name Jesus in the title. Finally, there's Laugh and Be Happy, an unfortunately incomplete demo that features Newman at his Tin-Pan-Alley best, with a catchy ragtime riff and a delightfully mocking lyric. This number is for my money one of the best tracks ever laid down by one of our most consistently rewarding, if challenging, singer-songwriters. Thanks for the memories, Randy!"
5,"It is so refreshing to have Glen back (and better than ever.) I am addicted to this CD.  ""Cleareyed"" and ""Finally Fading"" are in contastant rotation on my iTunes.  If you liked Toad the Wet Sprocket at all, you will not be disappointed"
4,"Two months before Billy Higgins' death, the drummer &amp; Charles Lloyd say their musical farewells with the tapes rolling (courtesy Lloyd's partner Dorothy Darr, who also made a film of proceedings).  They play sax/drums duets (Lloyd mostly on alto, in fitting homage to Ornette Coleman, though he also plays excellent Traneish tenor on three tracks); they perform exotic woodwind/percussion duets, with Lloyd on Tibetan oboe or flute; Higgins plays guimbri (the 3-stringed instrument used in Gnawa music), sings gently (&amp; rather dodgily) in a variety of languages, even plays a blues on the guitar or does a 1960sish paean to love called &quot;Take a Chance&quot;; Lloyd adds short meditations at the piano.  Some of these tracks don't mean much outside the context of this session--the piano solos get a bit too samey, &amp; there's too much voice'n'guitar (though the blues is rather nice).  Others are superb--the two long alto/drums duos (one on each disc) are great stuff, &amp; Lloyd's tenor pieces are also superb (there's a nice Traneish blues on disc 2).  The more exotic pieces are often quite ravishing.  I suppose that many listeners will for sentimental reasons like having all this stuff, the unalloyed good tracks as well as those that only acquire real significance in the face of Higgins' own personal tragedy.  I'm less sentimental when it comes to what goes on my stereo: I could have wished for a carefully selected single CD of the highlights, which would have been a genuinely outstanding disc.  Four stars as a compromise rating seems about right.  This isn't a disc for the casual listener, but for those willing to bear with a few qualitative dips &amp; peaks, it'll prove a rewarding release"
5,"Dave Douglas's music is touched by genius. He seems always to be ploughing his own furrow, playing the music he wants to play and with partners of his choice. His impeccable taste and unique compostional style come from a deep  understanding of jazz and contemporary music. This recording is probably my  pick, but all come highly recommended. His sidemen know how to listen, the  empathy is astonishing, it really is a joy to hear. I look forward to  catching him on tour in England this Spring"
5,"the word &quot;classic&quot;,in my opinion ,has been way over used in describing noted records.but if there ever was one,this is it!Janis' best and one of rock n'rolls best.the right songs,the right band and janis.timeless.full tilt boogie really took these songs where the (pretty lousy) big brother never could have.if janis had lived,the sky would've been the limit.her heart and soul in every song.a truly great work."
5,"One of my favorite albums (and all-time favorite album titles).  Enjoyable even if you are not a fan of country and western music.  Ray Charles performs these songs with his own unique style and sound (IMHO - most, if not all, of Ray's performances are superior to the originals)"
5,"Gid Tanner is a legendary old-time fiddler, so much so that old-time fans are frequently seen wearing t-shirts that say ""Gid is My Co-Pilot"".  The old-time style here is, to discerning ears, quite different than the more common ""Round Peak"" style, made most famous by fiddler Tommy Jarrell, and quite obviously different than, say, Ozark fiddling.  None of the styles are any better or worse, just different, and serious old-time fans will enjoy picking apart the nuances of styles.  More casual old-time fans will enjoy this record as well, though, for both the excellent repertoire and top-notch musicianship.  If you think O Brother Where Art Thou is the real deal, I suggest picking this up and having a listen"
5,This very fine cd - from County Records of Virginia - is superb! County have once again produced a well balanced selection from the archives and have presented it to the public for their delectation. I would recommend this item to all lovers of traditional American Country Music. Don't let it pass you by
4,"Zoot Sims never made a bad album, but he did make a great number that were merely very good. This one, however, is excellent. Sims, Peterson, and Pass all solo beautifully, and the bass and drum team of Mraz and Tate are  behind them every step of the way. The two standout tracks are 'I Got  Rhythm', where Sims follows an explosive Peterson solo with full-throated  honks and excursions into his beautiful upper register; and 'Embraceable  You', when Zoot proves that only Webster, Getz, and Hawkins can challenge  him for beauty of tone. That said, there isn't a bad track on this CD, and  it will give any Zoot fan -- any jazz fan -- a great deal of pleasure"
5,I love the way she sings and the gift of her voice touches me deep within my soul. She speaks my language
2,"I wish that the sound on the CD was anywhere close to ""Flowers of Evil"", if it had been I would have given it 5 stars.  The music is really great live Mountain - maybe the best I've heard, but the sound is terrible"
5,I was rather dissapointed by the awful review's of this CD. I love the band and consider all of there CD's to be the best one's in my collection. Ville Valo's lyrics just pull you into a different reality. The bands songs mixed with the Chris Isaak and Blue Oyster Cult's covers of Wicked Game and Don't Fear (The Reaper) make the CD better than imaginable. I don't care what the other reviews say I would consider this one of my favorite CD's.
1,"Italian music from St. Laurent, Quebec Canada? I guess that is what one would expect. Sounds like a bunch of French-Canadian college students trying to audition in a faux-Italian bar. It is pretty bad. I don't know how they get ""Gloria"" as an Italian favorite. If you want Italian cafe music, don't buy this one. A waste of mone"
2,"I love trance music, that style of dance music with fast, continuous beats and rich electronic sounds, and often sweet sounding vocals, usually female vocals.  So I thought I'd like this album.  Well, I do like it musically.  It's not great, but it's good trance music.  But the lyrics ruin the album for me.  Most of the songs exude a bitterness toward love relationships or a cynicism that love will never work out.  Here are lyrical samples from the CD:  ""Maybe you're better off without me."" ""I'm wide awake, it's time to make it on my own; the dream is over."" ""We wanted love to last forever, but something's missing...I can't find words to break your fall, when 'Goodbye' says it all."" ""It gets lonely, but I have no other choice...no one sees my dreams falling all apart...I've been blinded by your lies.  I never knew love could be so wrong."" ""Tell me why you can't feel the things I do...I made the same mistakes I know I'll make again...It meant nothing to you, you'll never understand, it meant nothing to you, the touch of my hand."" ""November's here again, raining down on me, I disappear again..."" ""It seems like every [scrub?] I see is trying to get it on with me, they think it impresses me, the way they act so foolishly...I don't care, I never liked you anyway...You're a total waste of time.""  If these lyrics fit your life, and you like trance music, you'll probably like this album.     I do like the remake of A-Ha's ""The Sun Always Shines On TV.""  It's not better than A-Ha's 8-minute remix version, but it's nice to hear an old favorite with a new flavor.  This album has three mixes of the song, none of them significantly different from the other.  I also like the instrumental track, ""Blown Away."" These tracks are enjoyable, and a couple others have pretty nice lyrics, but the album as a whole I find too depressing"
5,i've always loved Pete Tong and his essential mixes.  then came this movie about the days long gone.  movie was awesome and so is this album.  every song has it's value.  day and night
1,"I bought this CD, and it won't play in my car because of the copy protection.   So I returned it.  WaYn"
5,this is the best real punk band. they are hardcore.  ilove them and they can be compared with the casualties and the exploite
2,These songs take me back and are all top hits! It should be noted that the CD will not play in some players. Some copy protected thing I guess. It would be nice if Amazon would list the players that don't work with these CDs so we could make a better buying decision. 2 stars for the player problems. 5 stars fot the music
2,"I'm a big Judy Garland fan, but found this CD lacking.  Her voice didn't have that extra force she always puts into her songs.  Some of them sounded like a bad imitation or she recorded it in her sleep.  It says &quot;original soundtrack&quot;.  Maybe it needs to be re-mastered.  It certainly won't be my favorite"
5,"On the soundtrack to the movie STAYING ALIVE,the not-too-popular sequel to SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER,there are five original Bee Gees' compositions and recordings(THE WOMAN IN YOU,I LOVE YOU TOO MUCH,BREAKOUT,LIFE GOES ON and SOMEONE BELONGING TO SOMEONE). We hear an edited version of STAYIN' ALIVE(only the movie title carries the G). The originally released 4 minute and 42 second version of the song is heard during the film's end credits when John Travolta struts through Times Square. The film was directed by Hollywood great Sylvester Stallone,and makes a very short cameo appearance in the opening credits. Sylvester's brother Frank,appeared in the film as Tony,a bandmate of Cynthia Rhodes who played one of Travolta's love interests. Frank performs FAR FROM OVER,MOODY GIRL and with Rhodes, NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP. Rhodes performs FINDING OUT THE HARD WAY solo. The almost unheard of Tommy Faragher performs LOOK OUT FOR NUMBER ONE and (WE DANCE)SO CLOSE TO THE FIRE. Released in 1983 as was another Bee Gees' production,Kenny Rogers' EYES THAT SEE IN THE DARK album"
1,"This recording is mediocre at best.  While the University of Miami Chorale is a fantastic choir, it should shy away from certain types of songs.  It doesn't have the broad range of sounds that the far better BYU Singers or Concordia Choir does.  'Water Night' is sung well, but not appropriately.  This song should be sung without vibrato or it destroys the effect of the setting.  The dissonaces that vibrato creates takes away from the beauty of the dissonances that Mr. Whitacre has written.  Unfortunately for the listener, vibrato is used in this recording and destroys nearly all of the beauty contained in this wonderful piece.  Aside from that, the rest of the CD is neither good nor bad.  Discerning listeners will hear the differences.  The music of Rene Clausen is treated well in this recording, but not understood completely by choir or conductor.   If you're looking for a recording of 'Water Night', unfortunately this is the only one on the mass market right now and sometimes beggars can't be choosers so buy at your own risk"
2,"When I was 15 and first discovering guitar, I loved this album. Listening to it now, it just sounds incredibly soulless and cheesy.Vai is technically very impressive, but the man can't write a decent song to save his life. Vai's modus operandi is to get a bunch of faceless studio musicians, lay down a generic rhythm track, and go wheedily wheedily wheedily whee for an entire album.  Technique on your instrument is never a bad thing, however, technique should be just a means to an end, not the end itself. And that's what no shred guitarist seems to understand. The fact that shred guitarists like Vai aren't more popular is due to one thing: they're more concerned about playing faster and more cleanly than the next guy rather than writing songs. There's a GOOD REASON why non-guitarists hate this stuff.  Basically, once you get past the ""Gee, that's neat"" factor, this album, and nearly all of Vai's music, feels incredibly stiff and lifeless.To be blunt, this is what John Tesh or Yanni would sound like if they played guitar rather than keyboards. Not only that, his guitar tone is absolutely awful. Very thin, high pitched, and brittle sounding.  The best thing on here is the blatant Van Halen rip-off ""The Audience is Listening"": the rest is just masturbation. Vai's best work has always been as a sideman, especially the stuff he did with David Lee Roth, because then he's forced to play actual SONGS, rather than 5 minute long, tedious guitar solos. On his own, he's just unbearable. I considered giving this one star, but I gave it 2 stars due to the fact that Vai CAN play, it's just WHAT he's playing that's the problem."
5,"Lately I've been getting into the harsher side of Industrial/EBM and Unter Null (aka Erica Dunham) is my latest obsession. I absolutely thrive off the pulsating dance beats and just love the brutality of her voice and words, which is really more like aggressive poetry rather than screaming incoherently - making 'Sacrament' - part 1 of a twin EP concept - more appealing and accessible with its melodic abrasiveness.  Track listing goes as follows:  1. Prophecy 2. This Is Your End 3. Watch You Die 4. Playing The Fool 5. Endtime (INURE mix) 6. Disgrace (unholy remix by ADAM) 7. This Is Your End (T3CHNOPHOBIA mix) 8. Prophecy (BLANK mix"
1,"I would have ordered this soundtrack except I actually took the time to check out the list of ""songs"" that were on it and to read a couple of the reviews.  Sure enough, it was exactly as I thought myself....there was only one song that I actually recognized from the movie itself, Gloria Gaynor's ""I Will Survive"", which is a good song, but not even close to all the other great songs which were in the movie itself, but NOT in the actual ""SOUNDTRACK""!  What's up with that???  Great movie, great songs, should have a great soundtrack that is available to the fans, but it does not.  Too bad.  I understand that the person who wrote the actual ""musical score"" for the movie wants his due, but the fans want ""their"" music, too.  Do the fans not have a right to what they actually expect on the soundtrack of a movie?"
5,"It's a tough call between this Red House offering and&quot;One More Goodnight Kiss&quot;, but this record remains my favorite Greg Brown album and one of my All-Time Favorites (mind you, most of Greg's albums appear on  that ATF list!). Each song takes you through the country, no matter wh'er  you live there or not. If you've ever sweated in a growing season or you've  walked a gravel road, this album's for you.."
5,"For all those who may not know, Kendall Payne was unjustifiably cut from Capitol several years ago and was out of the music scene for quite some time. She has recently re-emerged with a brilliant independent CD, appropriately titled GROWN. Check out KENDALLPAYNE.COM for details or buy it directly at CDBABY.com. This artist needs signed again and deserves worldwide exposure. GROWN is a very, very good album that without question exceeds what she brought out five years ago with Jordan's Sister. It's very well produced, very well written, very catchy and also very heartbreaking. She's got all she had on Jordan's Sister and more on the new CD, including a track that she did with Lifehouse's Jason Wade that has a very nice vibe and distinctly Lifehouse feel. Check it out, and send this artist back to the frontlines"
4,"Snoop Dogg is one of my favorite rappers. I've grown up listening to him since I was a child while he was rhyming on Dr. Dre's ""The Chronic"". I've even stuck by him when he put out bad albums (""The Game Is Sold..."") and when he dropped a decent album (""Paid The Cost...""). ""The Blue Carpet Treatment"" would probably be his best in over a decade if you ask me.  This album is full of laced beats and good rhymes. ""Think About It"" comes off real strong from Snoop laced with a dope beat. The radio hit ""Thats That..."" with R. Kelly gives listeners a nice R&B tune to listen to. As well as the other hit ""I Wanna Love You"" with Akon, another hit for this album.   As I said in my title, this is what ""Cali Iz Active"" should have sounded like. That CD was so horrible and failed to follow it's concept. This album followed what that concept should have been. Most of the guest appearances are form Cali. ""Candy"" would feature Goldie Loc, MC Eiht, E-40, and The Dogg Pound, and a real nice tune to ride to. ""LAX"" with Ice Cube is another standout tune that featured a sample from Biggie's ""Going Back To Cali"" in the hook. I'd say for some reason, my favorite song is toward the end with ""Imagine"" with Dr. Dre. and D'Angelo. Possibly because that piano laced throughout the song. Snoop would close the album with ""Conversations"" with Stevie Wonder, showing off that he's trying to get his mind right. Other guests include The Game, B-Real from Cypress Hill, George Clinton, and Kam (where the hell have YOU been Kam???).  Although this is a good CD I've heard from Snoop in a minute, it still has some rough parts. ""10 Lil' Crips"" sounded kinda weak to me. And I wasn't feeling the song ""Beatin' Up On Yo Pads"" although it's a positive song about him coaching and playing football, but it's a good song, so I'll make it my honorable mention track.  If you heard that this album was his most consistant since ""Doggystyle"", you heard correct. We're more than aware that he's not going to drop another one of those albums, but this is a real good one from Snoop. If other west coast artists drop albums like this, we might have the West Coast making a comeback. And being a fan of West Coast rap music, I am more than ready for it. If you thought Snoop fell off, well he gives doubters ""Tha Blue Carpet Treatment"".  Lyrics: A- Production: A- Guest Appearances: A- Musical Vibes: B Overall: A-  My Favorite Tracks From This Album: Think About It, Thats That..., Candy (Drippin' Like Water), Gangbangn 101, LAX, Which One Of You, I Wanna [Love] You, Psst!, Imagine, Converstions  Honorable Mention Track: Beatin' On Yo Pads  Peace Everyone!!"
5,"This collection of Sly and the Family Stone is simply THE BEST CUTS you can put on ONE CD! Sure,there are others like ""You got Me Smilin'(again)"" ""Family Affair"" ""If you Want me to Stay"" but you need more than one CD for that! These are the cuts that turned me on to this History changing music!!"
5,"Another vote for Boss Guitar for the best Wes Montgomery record of all time. These remastered series are limited, and the sound is so much better than the regular CD that you wont believe it. This is essential listening"

4,"If you're a big fan of that 'laidback '70s California pop-rock sound' (and who in the right mind isn't?), then the late Nicolette Larson's 1979 album ""In the Nick of Time"" is an album you should definitely have in your collection. This was Nicolette's follow up to her debut album, 1978's ""Nicolette"", and it's actually a better album, easing off of the sappy balladry & country/ western fluff that takes up a painful amount of space on ""Nicolette"" in favor of infectious, no-nonsense pop-rock.  Although ""In the Nick of Time"" is a bit on the short side and has a few less-than-great tracks, it's largely a splendid album.  Nicolette's fun, innocently sexy presence and her irresistible, husky vocals are on full display on a bunch of ultra-catchy tracks including a couple disco-flavored tunes with ""Dancin' Jones"" and ""Breaking Too Many Hearts"", the driving, riffy pop-rocker ""Just In the Nick of Time"", & ""Daddy"" which has a piano-and-vocal barroom-style prelude before kicking into that good ol' California sound.  Also great is the breezy, feel-good ballad ""Fallen"", & the somewhat bossa-nova-flavored ""Rio De Janeiro Blue"" (which is suspiciously, and strikingly, reminiscent of Steely Dan's ""Your Gold Teeth"", especially with that little lick that appears at 1:56 of the track). ""Back In My Arms Again"", a Motown cover, isn't exactly a great song in the first place, but it's given an agreeably energetic performance. The cover of Karla Bonoff's ""Isn't It Always Love"" is nicely done, though it's quite similar to Karla's own version & not as strong, & the album ends in limp fashion with the dorky Little Feat cover ""Trouble"" which is quite annoying. The biggest hit to come from the album was the duet with Michael McDonald ""Let Me Go, Love"" which is a splendid, soothing ballad.  As with the previous & subsequent albums, this one was produced by Ted Templeman, & it seems he & Nicolette were an ideal match. If all you have by Nicolette is her compilation CD ""The Very Best of Nicolette Larson"" on Rhino Records and you think it's all you need of her, think again--the only track from ""In the Nick of Time"" included on there is ""Let Me Go, Love"".  Originally released in October of 1979 on Warner Bros., a big thumbs up to Wounded Bird Records for reissuing this highly recommended album on CD in February of 2005--the sound quality on this version is phenomenal.  Wounded Bird commonly releases two-fers, i.e. CDs with two albums on 1 disc; it would have been perfectly logical to pair this album with her first album ""Nicolette""--they would EASILY fit on a single CD--but it's still a pleasure to see that they've been re-released, and hopefully these reissues will help to introduce new listeners and remind old listeners of the numerous gems these albums contain.  For any Nicolette fan, ""In the Nick of Time"" is unquestionably a must-have."
5,Yo its like Sean B. Dady said
2,This is one of the few remixes that left me hanging. There was no imagination. What's the point?
2,"Bob Dylan's work has been adapted to all kinds of musical styles, and you'd think reggae would be a perfect fit, since, like Dylan, it often fuses of the spiritual and the political and both Dylan and many reggae artists have a fondness for lush but not gooey romantic ballads (No Woman No Cry etc).  But this CD really doesn't work for me. I like my reggae rootsy (as far as I'm concerned, Lee Perry is God, or I guess Jah), and this sounds like slick, soulless beer commercial reggae, the kind of thing you'd probably hear at a resort pool party. Producer Doctor Dread has a very unfortunate fondness for smooth jazz sax, cocktail lounge guitar and sacharine flutes. It's all very professional, yes. These are some of the top studio musicians in Jamaica (Sly, Chinna) and they hit all the right notes. But they're just picking up a paycheck. After this session it sounds like they could well have laid down some tracks for a Jamaican Tourist Board spot.  Some of it is okay. Toots is always great, Apple Gabriel has a wonderful molasses-and-ganja voice, Michael Rose makes an interesting choice in The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carrol and Sizzla turns Subterannean Homesick Blues into a dancehall song, which works surprisingly well (and I don't like dancehall). The cover of Gotta Serve Somebody is pretty good too, partly because it was recorded separately from the rest of the CD so the backing music isn't so cold and efficient. You should probably just cherry-pick these from iTunes.  But even many of the good performances are sabotaged by that awful by-the-numbers studio sound."
2,"I've been a Merle Haggard fan all my life and this CD is about as great as he gets. But, if you want the original recordings of these hits, look elsewhere"
4,"In my opinion this is Snoop's second best album even today, behind you guessed it, Doggystyle.  That said it isn't even close to being as good as Doggystyle, but it is still a good album and after Da Game... and the slightly dissapointing Doggfather this can be viewed as a comeback almost.  Da Game.... featured No Limit production and loads of appearances by No Limit rappers, and as a result was wack, both have been cut back here.  Snoop must have put his foot down and asked to bring in his own producers for No Limit Top Dogg, including of course Dre, for the first time since Doggystyle.  There are also less No Limit rappers (any is too many though) featured, but surprisingly few appearances by his old West Coast homies.  Anyway best track is easily B*tch Please, which is a classic in any era, Snoop's verses are tight but Xzibit is really the star of this track, as he makes what was really his mainstream breakthrough.  My other top tracks are Buck Em, Just Dippin (both Dre produced unsuprisingly), Betta Days, Down 4 my Nig*az and Trust Me.  Snoop also displays his impressive storytelling abilities on Snoopafella, where he basically re-tells Cinderella from his perspective.  Most of the other tracks are at least good, and the production for the most part is tight, though the album is not without filler (Gangsta Ride, In Love With A Thug).  Overall this is an impressive album from Snoop, yes it is not Doggystyle, I don't think there ever will be another one.  People have the tendency to mark Snoop albums against Doggystyle, rather than on their own merit unfortunately though. I'd give it 4 stars, recommended"
1,"I can't even believe alkaline trio even let that be put on a cd, that is terrible"
1,"Sadly, one of the greatest rock songs of all time finds itself on one of the most boring rock albums of all time.  To add insult to injury, the notes on the CD cover proudly boast of 'a full eight months recording' time, which had been 'preceded by a year and a half of reflection and writing'.  We're talking 26 months here, surely time enough to produce a decent album.  Instead, they produced their only good song, which I'll say again, is an acknowledged classic, only hated by true Eagles fans, as most true fans hate the classics of their favourite bands.  If an unknown band had tried to get a record deal at that time on the basis of the rest of the filler, I seriously doubt they'd have been successful.  For good use of studio time see what can be done with just 30 HOURS of it on Led Zeppelin I"

2,"America was formed by Dan Peek, Dewey Bunnel and Gerry Beckley, three US military brats living in London. America generally sounds like either a third rate Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young or Barclay James Harvest (who were all ready a second rate Moody Blues) without any new ideas of their own. This 1975 compliation does however have the advantage of collecting all of their hits without wading through some of the painful filler on their individual albums"

5,"Wood / Water breakouts with a new maturity on this departure from the usual emo - core sound the band has cultivated over the years. A band that has been a cult favorite presents an unyielding indie - pop classic that begs to be listened to over and over. The old fan may be thrown for a loop at first listen but after several listens, the depth of the writing and complex arrangements become a staple of your CD player. Buy this CD"
1,"I ordered two copies of this CD, one for me and one for my daughter.  It will not play on my CD player, a Technics model.  We have never had anything like this happen before.  My spouse took the CD to a neighbor's home and was able to play it on his player.  On the strength of that, I gave my daughter her copy.  I have no idea whether she has tried to play it or not.  My guess is that she won't until next Christmas.  She is overworked and that won't be a high priority.  In case you are wondering, our CD player continues to work well, playing all our other CDs"
1,"I never write reviews for the cds I buy, but felt the need for this one.  NFG seemed to be maturing with Catalyst, but sadly went back to writing the same thing they always wrote.  I tried listening to the cd a lot to get hooked, but it's weaker than their self-titled.  They grew for the next two albums into something bigger and better, and then lost it all.  This album is super poppy, which is ok, but the lyrics are some of their worst.  I know some might disagree, and that's fine.  I just wanted to warn people, if you liked the direction they were going in catalyst, then you'll probably see this one as a step backwards.  Sorry NFG!  I still love you!  In a manly hitting each other sort of way"

5,"&quot;The Best of the Heartbeats&quot; is  a classic!  The romantic lyrics, the perfect harmony, and the wonderful lead singer, &quot;Shep&quot; all make this CD appealing to listeners of all ages and  tastes"
5,"Jimi Hendrix is arguably the all time Master of the Guitar.  He has yet to be outdone in spite of the decades since his passing.  While I enjoy the sort of Hendrix tunes played frequently on the radio, many songs just aren't heard unless one owns the album.  South Saturn Delta is one of my personal favorites.  If you enjoy First Rays of the New Rising Sun, or Axis: Bold as Love, any Hendrix fan would appreciate this collection as much if not more.  Play on Jimi"
4,"_In the Fishtank_ is an ongoing venture of an independent record company that allows the free exchange of musical ideas between (usually) two bands. Ultimately, the _Fishtank_ delivers exactly what it promises: a veritable fusion of the bands in question to create a sound that in itself is unique, but could also realistically (though far-fetched perhaps) fit in with any of the individual artists' other recordings. The bands involved with this volume of _Fishtank_ are Isis and Aereogramme, two bands that have some overlapping qualities, but aren't exactly the same by any means. This is the first and only _Fishtank_ volume I have heard as of yet, but it is apparently a great success on more than one level.  ""Low Tide"" starts with a tender, echoing melody that sprouts like an elaborately blooming plant. The reverberating music seems to lean more towards the style of Isis, but the singer of Aereogramme handles the vocals. My first impression was that the vocals sounded a bit like Maynard James Keenan's quivering falsetto. Just a bit. Well maybe a bit more than a bit. Either way, they sounded good. The track builds up with a pulsing bass line and industrial rhythm then calmly dissipates into the vast void of the sea. ""Delial"" gets off to a heavier start, and the hollow vocals of Isis' Turner become shrouded in a driving rhythm that evolves into an abrasive screech.  The third track, ""Stolen"" is more relaxed, with an extremely peaceful orchestration forming the bulk of the song, which trails off into an ambient mix of synths and natural sound effects.  The _Fishtank_ concept is a good idea, and it provides a bridge of discovery for fans of both bands involved. For having only two days to produce the songs, I'd say both bands did a great job. I would also say that both fanbases will enjoy this, and for the price, it is another good impulse buy if you're looking for something new. Actually, I recommend getting all three albums in the Isis/Aereogramme trilogy that I have reviewed, along with _In the Absense of Truth_ and _Seclusion_, and listening to them in succession with the _Fishtank_ in their midst. All else aside, this volume has prompted me to seek out the others"
4,coolio's latest album is alright but some of the songs just didn't make much sense
2,"Let me start off by saying that I am a fan of operatic metal. I love Therion, Theatre of Tragedy, Tristiana, Lacuna Coil, Nightwish, all of the bands that any self respecting music fan should listen to. However, I should have seen this one coming. I must say, witohut a frickin doubt, this is the cheesiest album that I have ever had the displeasure of listening to. I shelled out 15 bucks for this album and I wish that I saved my money and bought a knife and stabbed myself in the frickin eardrums, and then bought a bucket of sulfuric acid and drowned myself in it. The band overall has good musicianship, (and their singer is hot), yet they write sub par music with cheesy medieval themes. THe band has potential, and it might help if the f***in music video wasn't a sing along with the words at the bottom of the screen. Please, if you are considering purchasing this album, dont make the same mistake I did, and buy Therion's Lemuria/Sirius B. Trust me, you'll be glad you shelled out the extra 5 clams"
1,"I know you're excited, and you want everything to be perfect and planned down to the tiniest detail, and you're working on [probably] the biggest budget you've ever had to work with, but PLEASE save the $__.__ and buy yourself a new 8-hour lipstick instead. Then go to the library, and oogle over how many of these ridiculous CDs they have for you to listen to for free. Trust me, once you decide on your songs, you'll never listen to the CD again"

2,"Based on my affitnity for the blues/rck genre and the 5 star rating of Joe's playing I picked up the CD/DVD combo(Amazon) and was, I hate to admit it, dissappointed. Granted, he can play and has good chops, but for me, something was missing. Maybe that intangible. The fire that comes through  the amps. Not that his playing was not emotional or inspired form his point of view, but for me it was lacking. I need to watch it again to see if I feel the same way. Like the a previous two star reviewer, I would have enjoyed seeing this guy in a local bar or someone's basement and would walked away satisfied. But when you start playing with the big boys, this guy comes up short"
4,"This is the first Branford I heard (back in 1990) and I've heard a lot of him since.  I sometimes find his stuff hard to get into, but his sound is so pure and the music so honest and driving that I keep coming back to it.  Also, and this is definitely worth mentioning, his band is hot and Jeff &quot;Tain&quot; Watts is an astonishing drummer.  In any event, Contemporary Jazz, The Dark Keys, Bloomington, The Beautyful Ones, and especially the recent Footsteps of our Fathers are all quite stunning albums, but they require comfort with free and intense music.  If you already dig 60's Coltrane and Ornette, go for it.  If not, and you want to jump in and hear why people think Branford is so good, Crazy People Music is a great place to start.  You get the fiery intensity of the later albums, but the tracks are easier to digest and the melodicism of the themes (and the solos) is more accessible to those less familiar with his style.  I wouldn't start any earlier in his career, because you get his more &quot;bop&quot; influenced style, which he has evolved past (though he still has that sweet tone).  Trio Jeepy is another place to start, but I think it too, though a fine album, doesn't give a complete sense of his mature sound.  I gave this four stars, because it's not his most amazing work, but I do love it and have come back to it regularly over the last twelve years.  If this gets its hooks in you, you'll like the later albums; if this sounds overwhelming and, well, crazy, you'll probably find the later albums only more so"
4,"I've followed Harry for years and have always enjoyed his albums because each one has a slightly different sound from the rest.  This latest CD is light, has gentle compositions, and is also swingin' fun.  It puts me in the mood for dancing under the stars or curling up by the fire.  I think it's about time Harry did a CD like this"
2,"I remember listening to a radio station that was giving away as many records as you could name in 10 seconds.  The caller gets on and says, ""Chicago 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 etc.  I guess Hot Streets would have slowed the process.....Anyways Hot Streets is further document of Chicagos gradual descent into easy listening oblivion and oh what a dreadful place that is..."
5,"Listening to this brilliant series of tunes is like taking a long breath of fresh air.  It truly touches the soul. I bought the CD on &quot;spec&quot; after hearing a couple of tracks about 5 months ago. Smart  move!   Over time, it has become the A, number one listening choice for  almost everthing I do. There is true beauty and depth in each track.  It is  well worth the money spent.  I'm looking for anything else Luis and the UN  band might have recorded.  Don't hesitate. you won't be sorry"
2,"This recording of the new works by Theofanidis and Higdon is first rate. Great performances, and nice to hear along side the Copland, which stands out as the real masterpiece. Mind you, Theofanidis and Higdon are obviously really talented composers.  I like new music. I like beautiful music. And I don't usually mind if the new music I hear is beautiful or ugly, has a tune, or not. What matters is that I am pulled in, and not lulled in with cliches or pandering.  The Theofanidis seemed to be much more interesting  to listen to than the Higdon. His sense of orchestral color is very strong. But overall, their music is very pretty, and somewhat boring. Get this to hear that great Copland: it is the piece that on this CD that pulls you in to listen. I know this piece is not the new piece on the CD, but it really stands the test of time against the more recent works"
4,"MY feeling of Europe '72 is this: Love, love, love disc 1. Every song is performed with energy, great jams and one of my favorite Tennesse Jed's ever. Disc 2 on the other hand bores me a bit. Truckin' is great, but the Prelude&gt;Morning Dew is boring to me. But the bonus material (starting with a beautiful and etheral Looks like Rain) redeems it. So not a perfect live disc, no other official releases truly shows the creative live peak musically and songwriting-erly (is that a word?) the boys were in 1972, in the midst of their prime"
1,"Nothing hear, just the same aimless blabbing and complaining about how the streets currupted a young man. Whoa, if i could only make a song about my messed up childhood and make billions, I would be richer than these wannabe softees out int the hip hop scene."
5,My mom bought this years ago and I still think it's wonderful music for Christmas.  Definitely buy this album.
5,"This release by ""20th Century Masters"" is part two of their Loretta Lynn Greatest Hits compilation.  This one covers the second part of her career, and like Vol. 1, the sound and recordings are clear and original.  There are 12 songs here, beginning with ""Wine, Women, and Song"" and ""Fist City"", and ending with ""I Lie"".  In between, there is a duet with Conway, and the controversial ""The Pill"".  Yes, there could've been more songs included, or even more popular songs chosen instead of those provided here, but this is a solid offering that will not disappoint"
1,"After i heard the new Bone CD i had much faith in this new release from Layzie, although his previous efforts were all , very admittedly, bombs.  And unfortunately this new release was no change for Layzie Bone. It seems as if a Layzie with out the Thugs is not a good deal.. With no ""hardcore"" or ""Club Worthy"" songs , his CD lacks anything truly listenable...honestly, his lyrics don't even represent his talent on his solo releases...Will Somebody please tell Layzie to not release solo albums!! He is tarnishing his reputation as a rap artist!"
5,"This is one of the best albums of the last 25 years and certainly one of the best I have ever heard. If you like good music like the Beatles, Kinks, Rolling Stones, Wilco, Fountains of Wayne, Beck, Coldplay, Prince, or Radiohead, then you will probably not be disappointed by this CD"
2,"I'll probably never run out of music to discover. It seems that no matter how many stones I turn, no matter how exhaustive my search is, there will always be atleast a few gems I'd somehow overlooked. For me, XTC are one of those gems. I picked up Black Sea at the local record shop and it completely knocked me out. Maybe it was those huge drums, or the way everything felt like it was pulling apart at the seams. Regardless of what it was, I had to have more. Over the course of the next few weeks I proceeded to buy Drums and Wire followed by English settlement. Again, both were completely stellar albums, especially D & W.  Then there was Skylarking. It was supposed to be THE XTC album, their masterpiece. People compared it to the likes of Pet sounds and proclaimed it one of the best albums of all time. I'm sad to say it didn't live up to the hype for me. In fact, I find it to be downright mediocre. For me this is where they dropped the ball and failed to pick it back up. I'll admit that I miss the more raw, punk like energy that was found in early XTC, but that's not why I dislike this album. I actually enjoy alot of mellow, lavishly produced music, but Skylarking just sounds...bland. None of the songs seem to stand out and the production is borderline soft rock. Every time I listen I hear less of what made me love XTC in the first place and more of why I can't stand Phil Colins. Even the songwriting itself is weak, lacking strong hooks and any sort of weight to help the music rise out of the syrupy muck that Todd Rundgren laid out. I just don't see what all the fuss is about."
5,"""I get pulled over by the cops, I be so drunk I'd be out dancing to their lights thinking I made it to another club."" ""...Turn the music up!! Hey what is this - a leather bar? I am not into this you fags!""    Hicks delivers on stuff like this every second line. The Dangerous album is a riot. Get Hicks if you have never heard him. He is probably one of the best undiscovered comedy acts of the 20th century, died from cancer shortly after his peak"
5,"A brilliant work, and no this review isn't of much help really, but I'd like to forward a theory about the guitar solo in the prog rocker Roots of Coincidence: PM had been listening to Tribal Tech guitarist Scott Henderson in the mid 90's as Scott moved away from compositional jazz-fusion toward fearless, bluesy, attitude-driven free-form guitar, decided Scott was having way too much fun at it - and with songs like ""Canine"" on TT's Face First who could argue? - thusly deciding to stake his claim on this invigorating new ground. It's good, interesting, but fleeting and disjointed, and Scott does it better. Still, what PMG here, on Imaginary Day as elsewhere, are able to render as musical generalists, by selecting from the full pallette of sonic colors and using each to maximum effect, ah! This, the artistic specialists and the attitude-driven often by contrast find elusive"
5,"I was around 16 or 17 when this record was released, and it was another Masterpiece by the Kings of Metal! This release, like the three before it, is part of the foundation of Manowar's Kingdom. This is one of my favorite Cd's of all time. It has some of the Heaviest moments in Manowar history, it's raw, stripped down, and heavy. This is what True Heavy Metal is all about. If I were going to give somebody a few CD's  to give them an idea of what Manowar is really about, it would be the first 4 CD's, because they truly are a great period for the band. During that time period, information about Manowar was hard to come by  here in the United States; the media ignored them, and the critics panned them, and neither had a just cause for doing so - Manowar's musical abilities far outweighed any of the bands that were getting coverage. Joey DeMaio is still the most original  bassist around, Eric Adams' voice is simply unbelievable (I've studied voice for the last 6 years - trust me, the guy is incredible). Scott Columbus is simply my favorite drummer. I began playing drums well over 20 years ago, and John Bonham was quickly replaced by Scott Columbus; and we finally come to Ross the Boss - there is not another guitarist around who has the style that Ross has.   The first 4 releases were recorded in Analog - that's why the releases that came out after this had a much different sound, the band began utilizing Digital Recording equipment for the following releases. For me, this CD was the end of an era, because Manowar's sound changed and became a bit more polished and less raw, and it wasn't until they released Triumph of Steel that they regained a lot of the rawness that the digital recording medium of the late 80's seemed to kill.   That said, I would highly recommend this CD to anyone wanting to get a taste of what Manowar was really about."
1,"I was disappointed that the ""Open Your Eyes (Baloobalot Hot House Piano Dub)"" by Rhythm Scholar was not on this CD.  It's really the only Donovan worth listening to.  Skip this and get something by Ochwat & Sam or Spanky My Monkey instead"
2,"To be honest, I must have hit a button by mistake which caused me to order something I really hadn't intended on buying.  There was no way to cancel it on-line so I figured I'd give the CD a listen, since I had Nellie's first CD, which I love.   I must say, I was disappointed.  Just seemed like every song sounded the same.  Maybe it will grow on me, the more I listen to it, but kinda doubting it"
1,"In my opinion, this is one of the worst things Reba has ever done.  Most of the songs are the typical pop flavored stuff that country music has become these days.  Its too bad and its an irony too because back in the 1980s she revitalized the traditionalist movement along with George Strait and Ricky Skaggs.  Why did she change??  To record stuff like this???  Awful"
1,This CD I regret to say is not up to Reba's standard of performance.  She's done much better. 
1,"Wow...I thought this album was going to be ""Too Damn Hot""...it is ""So Damn Not"" that it's frightening.    The tunes are weak, the Doctor's playing is OKAY but not inspired and Bernstein's guitar playing is beyond lame.  I've seen Bernstein at a club uptown and he was decent at best (better comping, not a great soloist) but this album doesn't display the best of either of these wonderful musicians' capabilities"
1,Arrrrgggghhh! This was the worst Geto Boys offering I have heard to date! Obviously Scarface wasn't enough to save this &quot;album&quot;. Why wasn't Bushwick in on this one? Most of the songs were performed by Willie-D and  I'm sorry but Willie-D can't rap! There isn't one single song on  this album that I would refer to anyone! This GB product deserves to be put  in the trash. I'm a true Geto Boys fan and I say to other GB fans out  there: DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!
5,"If you want to relive your days in the 60' use this CD to bring back old memories of what you were up to then. Fantastic, even better than before enhanced by CD quality"
5,"I bought this for my dad, (a Willie fan) but having a chance to listen myself found it to be a charming, innovative amalgamation of simple, sincere, sometime sinister, musical thought based on a recurring theme. A "" stand alone"" accomplishment from an American icon"
2,"There were multiple recordings of some of the same songs on this ablum. I can see doing maybe one song, two different ways. However, there was one song done three different ways and another song done twice which almost sounded the same"
5,"Although not a document of a working band, this is clearly a record Dave Douglas wanted to make. Following in the tradition of his sextet in honouring the compositions of particular composers, he has drawn together  the sympathetic talents of James Genus, Bill Carrothers and Billy Hart to  pay tribute to Joni Mitchell. Hers is music he obviously loves, the  reconstructions sounding like jazz standard song repertoire. The other  music uses Joni Mitchell's ear for a great tune as a springboard for Dave's  thoughtful, instantly appealing compositions. Beautifully recorded, this is  a one-off; don't miss it"
1,"You know this guy did appeal to me at first, but if you have this CD youve heard American Bad Ass, right? Listen to Metallicas &quot;Sad But True&quot;. He ripped off the guitar part completely. H e tries to be metal, hardcore rap, and country at the same time. Fails miserably. He is a talentless wigger. Wait...thats too nice. I hope he commits suicide"
5,"This is, perhaps, The Rolling Stones' masterpiece. After the disaster that was ""His Satanic Majesty's Request"" the band clearly decided to stop slavishly copying trends (and, one might add, following in The Beatles' footsteps).   Brian Jones appears only sporadically, it's his last album with the band. The Stones brought in Jimmy Miller to produce, after having learned the hard way that they work best when they have someone besides Mick and Keith at the mixing board. Nicky Hopkins' contribution to this album can't be understated. Rumor has it that Ry Cooder participated in the sessions.  ""Sympathy For The Devil"" kicks things off. For an inside look at the evolution of this iconic song see Jean Luc Godard's ""One Plus One"" (aka ""Sympathy For The Devil""). This song was scary and groundbreaking back in 1967 - now that we've all heard it 1,000+ times it seems far too familiar. In my opinion this is one of Mick's best lyrics.  ""No Expectations"" is a beautiful song, with lovely piano work by Hopkins. The lyric is a bit trite, but it works. Believe it or not this was the first single - it's perhaps the weakest song on the album.  ""Dear Doctor"" is really, really funny. The Stones were fans of country music, but here they take on the form as a cliche. ""For the gal I'm to marry / Is a bow-legged sow / I've been soakin' up drink like a sponge."" This is a hoot.  ""Stray Cat Blues"" - another reviewer stated that this is a homage to fans of the band. Jeez, I hope not! This is very creepy stuff. Mick's growls in the intro are absolutely filthy (""Yeah, just don't care...""). He sings this like an utter pervert, which is the point. ""Well I can see that you're 15 years old / But I don't want your ID."" By now it's obvious to the listener that The Stones have reinvented themselves - where did this sound come from? It's unlike anything we've heard on previous Stones albums.   ""Jigsaw Puzzle"" - many fans don't care for this song. It's a bit of a throwback, somewhat reminiscent of ""Something Happened To Me Yesterday"" and a few others from the previous incarnations of the band. Mick's lyric is a bit overwritten, but the final verse in particular is quite good. The band jams out well here - Keith, Wyman and Hopkins play off one another brilliantly, particularly in the coda. It's a fine side-ender.  ""Street Fighting Man"" - some of this was recorded in a living room. The basic drums are Charlie banging on telephone directory books. Some of the guitars were recorded on a cheap tape deck. The sitar is Brian; more amazing Hopkins piano here. This was, I believe, the start of Keith using the famous ""open G"" tuning he has employed since. A solid song, but I've always thought it a bit over-rated.  ""Prodigal Son"" - country blues, based on the Bible story. Mick's lyric is perfect, as is his vocal delivery. No contemporary British band could sound as authentically American when doing this style of blues.  ""Parachute Woman"" - more blues, but now we move from the Delta to the Big City. Bill Wyman has often referred to this is his all-time favorite Stones track. The sound is (purposefully?) muddy, and it feels perhaps a bit off-hand at first listen - but give it a chance. This is powerful stuff.    ""Factory Girl"" - an underrated gem. It's a beautiful song with a lilting melody, a fun yet poignant lyric, and a wonderful performance by all. ""Waitin' for a girl who's got stains all down her dress / waitin' for a girl and my feet are gettin' wet / she ain't come out yet / waitin' for a factory girl"" - that's as fine a depiction of working class life as I've yet come across.   ""Salt Of The Earth"" - the first verse is Keith Richard's first lead vocal on record. This is a stirring song, an apt followup to ""Factory Girl."" I wasn't at all surprised that this was a song Mick and Keith chose to perform at ""The Concert For NYC."" The vamp in the last 1/3 or so of this song is brilliant musicianship.  If one is familiar with The Rolling Stones only as a ""hit"" group, this album could be disappointing - there's no obvious Top Ten hit here. But if you appreciate music, and if you know anything about the history of this group, you will appreciate the fact that this was a groundbreaking album.   There isn't a bad track here. Each is brilliant in its own way. And, of course, this was the first of five great albums produced by The Stones - ""Beggar's Banquet,"" ""Let It Bleed,"" ""Get Yer Ya Ya's Out,"" ""Sticky Fingers,"" and ""Exile On Main Street."" They had never before reached these heights - and never would again.  The Rolling Stones are regarded by most fans and critics as contemporaries of The Beatles and Bob Dylan (""The Holy Trinity"" of the 60's) on the strength of the five albums noted above. They had a lot of hits before ""Beggar's Banquet,"" but if that was all they'd done they would be regarded as equals to The Animals or The Yardbirds, etal. They became rock royalty when they produced ""Beggar's Banquet."
2,"Slayer released Diablos in Musica in 1998.  This is a decent thrash album, but definitely not up to Slayer's standards.  Yeah, some people think Slayer sucks and they say they are over-rated.  These people are entitled to their opinion.  That being said, Diablos really is Slayers weakest album.  Maybe Tom Araya was able to sing in 1988, but his singing 10 years later just ruins the music.  His normal vocals are ok, but when he sings or tries a spoken word section, it really shows that he should stick with what he knows (if only James Hetfield took my advise; his voice makes me want to puke now).  Songs like Death's Head, Stain of Mind, Love to Hate are probably the worst Slayer songs they wrote up to this point.    This is the Slayer album I listen to the least.  There are song good songs:  Bitter Peace, Overt Enemy, Scrum and Screaming From The Sky.  Too bad the rest of the album is rather boring. "
1,"I did not expect a primer on Indian music.  I expectd, instead  examples of songs in different styles.  This CD does do that to a limited extent, but Ravi Shankar spends too much time instructing the audience.  The music that is presented seems rough and un rehearse"
1,"I bought this record assuming the songs would be as poignant and memorable as those on II. Instead, I found the music to be busy and impersonal, and I thought the lyrics (once again in comparison to those on II) sucked. Its often said that Up on the Sun demonstrates the Meat Puppets coming into their own 'sound', and that its a vast improvement over II. I fail to see how their work on II was any less of a genuine expresssion of the bands vision than this frankly dull piece of work"
5,"A half century ago, I was a junior in high school. We used to have these gatherings called ""assemblies,"" where the principal would collect the entire student body in the auditorium (no excuses allowed!) for an event of more than passing importance. At this late date, I can only remember a small handful of them: the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, President Truman relieving General MacArthur of his command. Oh, and one where two fellows from Ampex came to our high school to give a little demonstration of something called ""stereophonic sound,"" using, needless to say, an Ampex tape recorder.  And the music for this demonstration? It was the brief opening prologue (""Sunrise"") from Richard Strauss's ""Also Sprach Zarathustra,"" in this very same Reiner/Chicago Symphony Orchestra recording. This was a ""sneak preview to end all sneak previews,"" inasmuch as the monophonic LP (""New Orthophonic,"" I believe it was called) hadn't even been released at that early date. And, needless to say, this impressionable teenager was suitably impressed. So much so that, in the years to come, I acquired three LPs of the performance: the original monophonic LP, then the Living Stereo LP a few years later, and eventually, when the stereo LP had seen its better days, the Dynagroove rerelease (something I'd just as soon forget). I never did go the reel-to-reel route, and, when CDs eventually made their appearance, I opted for other performances of these two Strauss works rather than the earlier conventional Living Stereo CD release. But I always did have fond memories of that particular reel-to-reel tape demonstration back in '54; it was a direct copy of the 30ips master tape, and not the 7.5ips ""consumer"" version that came out shortly thereafter.  With BMG now releasing half-century-old Living Stereo classics as hybrid SACDs (10 at present, with surely more on the way), it was easy for me to select this recording as one of the first to sample. I was more than pleasantly surprised; just listening to the ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" prologue had the effect of turning the clock back 50 years; truly a trip down Memory Lane!  In a phrase, I wasn't disappointed. Even listening to the conventional CD layer, it was easy to get the sense that there I was again, listening to the 30ips master tape. Even with headphones, I heard no evidence of tape hiss; just beautifully balanced stereo sound with a tremendous sense of not only left-to-right spatial array but depth as well. (This is particularly evident in ""The hero's battlefield"" segment of ""Ein Heldenleben,"" where the initial muted trumpet fanfares sound as if they are coming from well behind the orchestra.) Throughout both massive tone poems, the music is well-served by RCA's ""minimalistic"" microphoning, with just two mikes picking up the sound field, and every single instrumental voice (and there are many of them) can clearly be heard. (Sir Thomas Beecham, that evergreen source of bon mots, reserved one of his best for ""Ein Heldenleben"" when he wrote that ""I once spent a couple of days in a train with a German friend. We amused ourselves by discovering how many notes we could take out of 'Ein Heldenleben' and leave the music essentially intact. By the time we finished we had taken out fifteen thousand."")  As for Reiner's interpretations, perhaps the simplest way of putting it is that there is no time in the last half century that I can recall when these two performances were NOT included in EVERY ""essential recordings"" discography (even when the sound quality was not as it is here, in the hybrid SACD release). Reiner had a way of not oversentimentalizing these two works, as if they had been the products of one of the world's greatest egos, which, in fact, they were: Strauss made no bones about himself being the hero of ""Ein Heldenleben."" Reiner keeps things moving along, lest they bog down for the empty rhetoric that they can often be in lesser hands.  A century ago, when Strauss had been the most famous composer who was also a conductor and Gustav Mahler had been the most famous conductor who was also a composer, audiences couldn't get enough of the Strauss tone poems. (I think, in fact, that the record will show that Mahler conducted Strauss's tone poems more frequently than he did his own symphonies!)  And a half-century ago, when I had been in my musical adolescence, so to speak, I too couldn't get enough of them. But they haven't worn all that well in the intervening years. Now, considerably older and modestly wiser, I can only take them in infrequent doses. (Perhaps I've simply taken Strauss at his word when he described himself as ""a first-rate second-rate composer."") And, fortunately for this now-jaded me, these Reiner performances, long perfect in everything but sound quality, have arrived with, finally, sound quality that matches the performances.  I have every expectation that future ""essential  recordings"" discographies will continue to include these performances, now with this newly-refurbished sound quality that is the match of any.  Bob Zeidle"
2,"This album was a disappointment. I was looking forward to Muddy's covers of &quot;Caldoinia&quot; and &quot;Kansas City&quot; but it wasnt what I thought itd be. Dont get me wrong, Muddy himself was fine, but he gets  overshadowed by the musical collaborators. There is an overuse of harmonica  and organ, and the annoying presence of ACCORDIAN! Accordians and Waters do  not mix. This over-instrumentalization leaves the album sounding lame and  folky and not bluesy. If you're looking for Muddy's later work, try  &quot;Blues Sky&quot;, with Muddy working with Johnny Winter and his back  to basics production"
1,"I tried not to give it any stars, which is what it deserves.  I have a difficult time understanding why Mr. Eastwood continues to write the soundtrack to the films he's involved in.  There are composers like Harry Gregson-Williams, Elliot Goldenthal, James Newton Howard, David Julyan, Mark Isham, etc... that can create something meaningful and 10 times more advanced than what ""Dirty Harry"" can create.  Would the director and executives of another major motion picture accept a soundtrack of this quality?    I hated Mystic River's soundtrack as well.  I think he got lucky with Million Dollar Baby.  Not much music that might have ruined the acting, and no inspirational music when she is winning all the fights, unlike the Rocky movies.    I am very aware that he doesn't posess the education, training, and experience that all of the major Hollywood composers do.  But he should stick to acting and directing.  He has proven himself to be very good at both of those with the awards he has recieved in his lifetime.  I think he is just trying to show off at how much he can contribute to a movie.  And his ""music"" is nothing noteworthy at all, in my opinion.     While his attempt to write another score is surprising, it leaves so much to be desired in a film like Flags of Our Fathers.  It's a tremendous film, with an interesting story, great characters, great acting, and authentic battle scenes, much like Saving Private Ryan (John Williams).  They have a meaningful well-made film ready for a composer to add thier ideas and talents to, and make a great movie-going experience.  And then we get the same boring nursery rhyme style melody and chord progression over and over and over again.  And then on top of that, it's rudementally orchestrated between guitar, piano, and trumpet with those long droning strings.  Granted, not much to work with for Lennie Niehaus who orchestrated it.    I got so sick of it on just one viewing only.  And the scene when the son is looking at the pictures and the medal, as stupidly simple as that melody is, I think it's completely intrusive in that scene.  It ruined a moment that could have been very moving with anything different musically, or maybe no music at all.  I believe everyone has a job when making a movie, and when one person is doing too much, the quality suffers.  And that's if Clint Eastwood was an educated composer, which he isn't.  No one can deny that, not even him.  As I mentioned before there are so many composers out there that could have made that film even more moving and powerful.  I think that the executives looked the other way and let something like this happen because of a big name like Clint Eastwood.  Film music is an evolving art form constantly struggling to get the recognition it deserves.  And with good moives being made that are horribly scored in this way, it's not helping the film music world at all.  It is admirable for someone to try new things and contribute in ways not thought of before.  But when they don't have any talent, they shouldn't be allowed to do it.  I am an aspiring film composer taking classes, going to movies, and buying soundtracks to learn as much as I can about it.  It gives me a moment of pause when decisions like this are being made about major films.  I know it's just Clint Eastwood attempting this, but what if more actors and/or non-composers try doing it?    Please, no more soundtracks Mr. Eastwood!  You do what you are good at and leave the music to the established, experienced, and well-known composers of Hollywood.  Bryan Arata             "
5,"Listening to 'Mastered the Art' is the acoustic equivalent of running your hand over shag carpet that hasn't been vacuumed since the seventies - it reveals a surprising accumulation of hidden textures and diverse beats, from Spanish-style acoustic guitars and menacing orchestration to xylophones and Galaga samples (you know the tractor beam sound just before your ship gets taken up). 'Mastered the Art' is a gigantic mixed-media canvas that subsumes all the brilliance of his previous albums while adding authentic variation and depth. Like any original work of art, 'Mastered the Art' is difficult to categorize - it represents the leading edge in the ongoing revolution that is combining hip-hop, jazz, groove, and funk into unique and powerful musical expressions. Greyboy is an accomplished composer and this album is a masterpiece. Now if only he'd publish the complete list of his 8-track collection. . "
4,"If the Astralwerks label that released this 1973 gem were clever they'd re-release it with a bright yellow sticker on the cover that says: ""FEATURING: 'SUPER 16', AS HEARD IN THE NEW QUENTIN TARATINO MOVIE KILL BILL VOL.1!!!"" Then watch the sales of NEU! 2 surge its way up to the top of the Billboard album charts, purchased by young hipsters salivating for any and all obscure references incorporated into the cult movie flick.  Okay, that may never happen, but still, it was quite a treat to hear the brief snippet of ""Super 16""'s turntable sludge ooze from the speakers of Tarantino's movie. ""Super 16"" might serve a few seconds of quirky soundtrack music, but as representation of the superb, and breif, discography of NEU!'s body of work it does the band a great disservice. Hearing this track rekindled my interest in NEU!'s music again, and to write this review.  NEU! 2 is perhaps best approached as two halves, the first half, which consits of the first 4 tracks: ""Fur Immer"", ""Spitzenwualitat"", ""Gedenkminute"", and ""Lila Engel"" (as of this writing Amazon's tracklisting is incorrect) . This is the heart of the album, with the driving ""Fur Immer"" connecting the dots between Kraftwerk's motor beats with alternative rock riffing.  ""Lila Engel""  pounds agressively like there's no tomorrow, years before it became fashionable in punk music.  Did I mention this music was originally released in '73? Awesome!  The second half consits of the remaining 7 tracks which, reportedly due to budget restraints, were recorded with minimal material. The band's solution was to drag or speed up pieces of their own music in various configurations using a turntable (complete with needle drops and vinyl scraping). The woozy ""Cassetto"" feeds music through a dying cassette player until its last, wretched gasp. This section of NEU! 2 is remixing in its most primitive form. Although it's an amusing idea to recycle pre-existing material in this fashion, the approach wears itself thin quite early, and hardly justifies any repeat listens.    I would say that NEU! 2 is second best behind the band's self-titled debut (Rating: 5 stars), and tied with their 3rd and final(?) effort NEU! 75, where NEU! were beginning to sound too self-conscious, IMHO.  NEU!'s music has become better with age and surpasses any music out here that is being labeled ""alternative"" these days.  It's good enough for Tarantino, and it's good enough for you! BUY IT!  Favorite tracks:  ""Fur Immer"", ""Lila Engel"",  ""Super""  Final Rating: 3.5 out of 5."
5,"This album is without any doubt one of the most original CDs I have ever heard. The success in which Kearney mixes musical styles is astounding. What makes this album so enjoyable besides the catchy melodies, good lyrics and his voice is the top notch production given to each of the tracks. There is so much here that one most listen to the album a good 3 or 4 times before you start to truly appreciate the depth of this work."
1,"Quel manque de considération pour les fans qu'on considère ici comme des moutons capable d'acheter n'importe quoi au prix fort. Alors que Sony dispose d'une centaine d'heures en haute définition son et audio, on nous propose une nouvelle compilation chère, avec un seul inédit et une pochette bien baclée. Bref l'éditeur va nous découper les titres live ou inédits comme du saucisson pour exploiter les pauvres fans. Pour les plus jeunes qui découvrent, Amazon propose d'anciennes compilations bien plus complètes   .

1,"Que dire de Mika? Le personnage à 2 neurones qui se courent après... Ok on ne lui demande pas de faire des phrases, c'est entendu. Ceci étant dit il en fait. et c'est pathétique. Bon alors sa musique et ce CD? Ben c'est comme quand il parle... il ferait mieux de fermer sa bouche tant c'est pathétique. Bof et re bof... musique de kidult décérébrée?... peut-être! MDR"
2,"Dès le premier titre , on est charmé par une voix veloutée et des arrangements à l'ancienne ; violons en nappe, guitare jazzy... Mais passée cette surprise agréable, on déchante pendant que Melody chante. On finit carrément par s'ennuyer. Le titre 2, bien que plein de bonnes intentions, ne rivalise pas avec ""Girls from Ipanama"". Le titre 3 ""Who will comfort me"" pâle copie de ""Fever"" manque vraiment d'originalité, et là Melody surfe limite avec le plagiat de mélodie. Bref, on s'ennuie ce qui n'enlève pas la qualité de la voix pas non plus extraordinaire (loin de la voix de canard de Duffy) mais ça ne suffit pas : la note tenue en fin de titre 5 est vraiment limite amateur. On sent peut-être un peu trop les ficelles ""New Orleans"" cuivre, trompette avec sourdine, parfois à la Count Basie, pour faire genre. Ca sent vraiment le formatage à plein nez vu la courte durée de certains titres qui auraient pu être développés (Exemple avec le titre 4).  Le titre 6 , plein de nostalgie, très bien réalisé, avec de jolis sons de violons, de cymbales, nous redonne espoir mais ne suffit pas à sauver l'album. Melody aurait pu nous épargner le titre ""Les étoiles"" où elle chante en français. On lui est reconnaissant mais cela frise le ridicule au niveau de la prononciation à la Birkin : heureusement ou malheureusement, il n'y a pas beaucoup de paroles mais beaucoup de jaccassements. En résumé, c'est correct mais on s'ennuye. De loin je préfère les 2 premiers albums de Diana Krall (Moins excellente dans ses derniers albums) Ce type de production montre que tout le monde veut surfer sur la vague ""Old School"" et nous la recycler ; mais à part Amy Winehouse qui, dans une production impéccable se détache du lot, il manque ici la magie qu'on ne peut expliquer. Alors autant écouter les originaux..."
2,"j'ai écouté ce disque par curiosité. c'est bien fait, belle voix, beaux arrangements,belle production. du travail de pro, quoi. à partir de là pas une once d'émotion, aucune passion, rien; c'est froid et aseptisé. à la mode. mode qu'on aura oubliée dans quelques mois. voilà l'industrie du disque après les succès de norah jones et diana krall nous sort leurs clones par cargos entiers. au moins ce style de ""musique"" à un ""avantage"" elle s'oublie aussitôt le cd terminé.  garçon, une ella fitzgerald s'il vous plait et ensuite j'écouterai bien billie holliday et pour terminer joni mitchell me parait parfait."
5,"Surprenant oui, même si la Madonne reprend les mêmes pour pauffiner ""Music"". On pourra critiquer ce pseudo-manque de créativité. Il n'en est rien. ""American life"" reprend le style (perfectionné) sous forme d'un album concept (tel ""Ray of light"" ou ""Erotica"", présentation risquée qui avait très bien marché pour le premier, mais raté pour le second), et en cela détrone un ""Music"" affaiblit par une hétérogénéité spontanée mais non aboutie.  C'est vrai, dans ses paroles, elle raconte des choses que tout le monde sait, mais c'est la première fois que le tout sort de sa bouche. Ayant suivit ""l'artiste"" sur 18 des 20 ans de sa carrière cette confession est une vraie mane. Car oui, si on passe outre la controverse politique (sans doute trop calculée), on retiendra que, même pour des gens tels quels, des gens qui ont foncé, tête baisée dans leur travail, l'amour est possible et l'emporte, à la fin.  Madonna, guitare à la main, qui chante l'abandon de l'ego et l'amour à 1 homme. J'en ai la chair de poule..."
5,"Sera t-elle encore là ou l'on ne l'attend pas ? La réponse est incontestablement ""OUI"". Sur ces deux précédents albums, la Madone a su dressé notre oreille aux sons des musiques et des voix électroniques. Que pouvait-on attendre de plus d'une nouvelle collaboration de la star avec Mirwaïs ?….. et c'est sur ce point précis que Madonna nous met K.O. ! Ce nouvel album ne ressemble aucunement a ce que nous avions pu entendre par le passé. Cet opus est  un nouveau voyage qui vous prend aux tripes et qui ne vous lâchera pas jusqu'à la dernière chanson. Le talent musical de Mirwaïs et le lyrisme de Madonna ont mis au monde un album a la fois si simple, et pourtant si sophistiqué…. Et c'est là ou se trouve le secret de cette grande réussite : Chaque morceau de l'album est une partie d'un monde ou l'on s'exalte, ou l'on rêve de n'être qu'un cocktail de sons…. Le disque s'arrête… Je vais de nouveau l'écouter !"
2,"Lorsque Muse a sorti son  , le choc a été grand: pop, rock, lyrique, un trio anglais retrouvait la force du   de Radiohead avec le lyrisme de   de Jeff Buckley. Dans les albums suivants, on finissait par se rendre compte que Muse tenait plus de Queen et de ses volontés de démesure, parfois avec bonheur (  reste un album très sympathique, quoiqu'en dessous de Showbiz) et parfois pour notre plus grand malheur (  est vieux dès sa sortie et fatigue). Au total, deux mauvais album et deux bons, dont un excellent. Ce Resistance est donc l'album qui pouvait faire pencher la balance d'un côté ou de l'autre... et c'est vite vu: Muse a définitivement plongé du côté grandiloquent. Ce qui était plus sympa sur Absolution devient ici assez soulant, d'autant que cette fois-ci Bellamy et sa bande ne se contentent pas de se rapprocher de Queen, ils singent carrément le groupe de Freddy Mercury, sauf que c'est moins bien et que ça finit par être sans intérêt. Entre Uprising (et sa guitare qui fait penser à du Blondie période Call Me) et le final Exogenesis (symphonie rock assez plate), Muse essaie de nous pondre des chansons basées sur ce que le groupe fait depuis déjà des années, mais en en rajoutant 3 tonnes. Résultat, le sentiment de voir appliquer une recette et celui de voir une grosse production enrobée les chansons pour cacher leur misère, tout cela ne donne pas très envie d'écouter l'album en boucle. Il y a bien des mélodies intéressantes, mais l'ensemble est tellement grossier, qu'au final on préférera réécouter Showbiz."

1,"Après un premier opus excellent, quelle déception! Premier morceau dans la veine du premier album puis le reste plus difficile à apprécier. Lassitude et ennui en cours. Après trois écoutes complètes, j'ai laissé tomber.Quelques morceaux pourraient décoller (""Pick Up Off The Floor"")mais pour le reste, je n'accroche pas. Peut-être le coup de coeur reviendra sur le prochain album, mais ce deuxième album ne restera pas sur ma platine. Allez hop, je vais réécouter le 1er album pour oublier cette déception."
5,"Le Knopfler nouveau est arrivé et le bonheur est au rendez-vous. Ce nouvel opus est captivant et s'ouvre de la meilleure des manières avec l'entraînant ""Border Reiver"" qui annonce la couleur celtique de l'album avec une superbe intro. L'ensemble brasse une grande diversité de styles au risque de manquer de cohérence. On trouvera notamment un blues classique (""You Can't Beat The House"") et un Rock ""Les Paulien"" dans la veine de Dire Straits (""Cleaning My Gun"") intercalés entre les ballades aux sonorités Irlando-ecossaises.  La deuxième partie monte en puissance émotionnelle et comporte des pépites inoubliables telles que la somptueuse ""So Far From The Clyde"" sublimée par la Les Paul.  De facon générale, la performance instrumentale de ""Get Lucky"" est à mes yeux la plus intéressante depuis ""Sailing to Philadelphia"" avec de très beaux soli dans le plus pur style Knopflerien. Seul bémol : l'insipide ""Hard Shoulder""   A la lecture de quelques commentaires précédents, certains s'échinent à vouloir retrouver du Dire Straits dans ""Get Lucky"" et ne jugent qu'à travers ce prisme réducteur dénué de pertinence aujourd'hui; on parle tout de même du sixième album solo de l'artiste !"
1,"Bon point : la pochette ressemble à celle des derniers albums de Johnny Cash !  Sinon : apparemment c'est un album à écouter en plusieurs fois, mais qui a envie de subir ça plusieurs fois de suite ? Je l'ai écouté en entier mais je n'y ai pris aucun plaisir. Je ne comprend pas à qui ses paroles s'adressent. Les joggeurs du dimanche par exemple, à quoi sert cette chanson ? Je ne comprend pas qui ça peut toucher. Pour moi cet album est tout sec et ne me laissera aucune impression durable."
1,mais que faites vous avec ma commande reponse souhaiter au plus vite pas contente du tout
2,"Bah çà alors, au moment de saisir la pochette que vous avez sans doute sous les yeux, je dois avouer que j'ai eu un moment de doute....alors comme çà il ne serait pas mort ? quel sacré farceur ! Non, vous avez bien compris que ce n'est certainement pas avec Michael Jackson que j'ai confondu l'individu sur la pochette, mais bel et bien avec la star des nuits 80s parisienne, le novo dandy destroy   et c'est vrai que la ressemblance est frappante et sans doute voulue. Clubber invétéré, ami de tout ce que la nuit compte de créatures... nocturnes, une culture musicale encyclopédique et pointue et (même si je ne connais pas particulièrement la vie de Guetta) une consommation honorable de produits divers et variés permettant de tenir toute la nuit sur le dancefloor, il n'y a pas à dire, les points communs ne manquent pas entre David et son   de prédécesseur. Mais, tandis que l'un officiait dans l'alter-littérature branchée et élitiste au possible, l'autre avec une régularité sans faille déverse une musique sans âme débitée au kilomètre dont le seul but est bien évidemment de faire bouger les popotins. Sur ce One Love (s'il ne s'est pas pris les pieds dans ses dreads, Bob doit se retourner dans sa tombe) David nous donne pour la énième fois la recette miracle pour pondre de la musique à gogo et en vendre des charters entiers: un gros boumboum bien régulier et des guests qui viennent brailler dessus des paroles pleines de peace, love et harmony, assez peu raccord avec le pillonnage que l'on entend derrière. Pour les guests, là on est servi, c'est bien simple, il n'y a pas un titre où il n'y en ait pas ! Donc çà braille à qui mieux mieux, bien raccord avec l'ambiance défonco-bourré qui reigne sur la piste, çà tape bien dans la tête, non c'est du bel ouvrage... Fut un DJ qui se faisait appeler Manu le Malin, pas de doute cependant, le plus malin de tous c'est bien tonton David et sa tatie de moitié qui ont su faire de leur nom un label de qualité et de crédibilité à coller sur toute la sombre daube qu'ils produisent... voilà c'était mon avis qui n'engage que moi !"
1,"ouais !!!! ca ressemble, mais comme canada dry ca n'est pas ca. Le premier titre est un plagiat de summertime , et le reste de la ""varietoche"" aux accents bluesy et jazzy pompeux. Si vous en avez marre de zazie ou autre chanteuse nullissime franchouillarde bobo,achetez: ca sera mieux. Si vous aimez fitzerald, holliday, vaughn ,etc etc ecoutez votre discotheque pour l'instant il n'y a pas mieux et ""de loin"""
2,"j'ai écouté ce disque par curiosité. c'est bien fait, belle voix, beaux arrangements,belle production. du travail de pro, quoi. à partir de là pas une once d'émotion, aucune passion, rien; c'est froid et aseptisé. à la mode. mode qu'on aura oubliée dans quelques mois. voilà l'industrie du disque après les succès de norah jones et diana krall nous sort leurs clones par cargos entiers. au moins ce style de ""musique"" à un ""avantage"" elle s'oublie aussitôt le cd terminé.  garçon, une ella fitzgerald s'il vous plait et ensuite j'écouterai bien billie holliday et pour terminer joni mitchell me parait parfait."
2,"On craignait ce second album de notre ""chavette people"" préférée, entre épuisement de l'inspiration et fatigue du ""concept"". On n'avait pas tort, mais la déception principale de ""It's not me, it's you"" vient de là où on ne l'attendait pas : d'une production d'un mauvais goût insigne, superposant les couches de synthé jusqu'à l'écœurement physique de l'auditeur, retrouvant même la vacuité du son des 80's à force de surligner de beats synthétiques cette pop trop sucrée. Oui, malgré 4 ou 5 bonnes mélodies tenaces (on est loin du sans faute de l'album précédent !), malgré les textes souvent pertinents, voire brillants, ce disque est une déception cruelle, la réalité crue des banlieues londoniennes étant désormais soigneusement dissimulée derrière des effets ""bling blings"" qui n'honorent pas Lily Allen !"
4,"Je ne supportais pas son titre ""smile"" et j'ai été très agréablement surprise par cet album frais, dynamique, ironique et facétieux à l'image de Lily ! J'aime le 2nd degré des airs de goguette style ""Marie-Ti et Gilbert Carpentier"" que l'on retouve dans sa musique (et dans un de ses clips).J'ai hâte de la voir sur scène aux Vieilles Charrues !"
4,"Je l'ai vu á Paléo, il était super!!!! Le CD est pas mal ;)"
5,"Je viens juste de lire les commentaires et apparmmenrt soit on aime soit on desteste ..... Et moi j'adore . Je vous dirai donc que sur cet album tout fonctionne à merveille. les rytmes, les mélodies, la voix de la chanteuse.... c'est simple je découvre et je suis fan. A ECOUTER"
1,"Quel dommage... Un si beau texte, et un resultat si monotone et ennuyeux... Nous n'avons jamais eu le courage ou la patience de l'ecouter integralement..."
1,"J'ai toujours détesté cet album car :  - Les compos sont boiteuses, - Des synthés vilains sont partout ( J.P Jones doit joué autant de claviers que de basse sur ce disque ), - La voix de Plant est irritante Il y a quelques trucs comme ""Hot Dog"" ou ""Evening"" (Qui est meilleur sur Knewborth) qui sont pas mal"
2,"Voila une belle illustration du fait que Madonna, loin d'anticiper les modes comme souvent dit, ne fait en fait qu'accrocher ses wagons au train en marche (ce n'est pas un reproche du reste, juste une constatation et une mise au point). 1993, un petit lutin venu d'Islande fait souffler un vent de fraîcheur sur la pop avec son  , subtil mélange inédit de pop, de dance, de jazz et de world music (du trip-hop quoi...). Le disque est produit par Nellee Hooper (ex-Soul II Soul, qui gravitait autour de la galaxie Massive Attack). Il lui faudra donc Hooper à la Madonne pour son prochain CD. Et tant qu'à faire, Björk aussi. Björk qui résistera aux sirènes avant de lâcher malgré tout un titre (""Bedtime story"", de loin le morceau le plus électronique du disque, et le meilleur), tout en refusant de rencontrer l'Américaine. Pour le reste, Madonna, aidée par plusieurs autres collaborateurs, poursuit dans la veine du précédent album ( ), en plus ""cool"" mais encore moins orienté ""dancefloor"". Quasiment tous les morceaux sont en effet des ballades sirupeuses ou des titres ""downtempo"" un peu mous du genou et le disque sera à nouveau un échec. Une première moitié des années 90 difficile donc pour la star mais qui a le mérite d'en dévoiler une autre facette, plus introspective, avant un redémarrage en fin de décennie (albums   et  )."
5,"encore une fois , madonna vous offre un album reussi a tout point de vue, le son moderne , les paroles emouvantes ( dans mother and father par exemple).cette edition contient un poster de la madonne ainsi qu'une planche de timbre, le tout dans un superbe coffret.je ne peux que vous conseiller cet album ,il est a la hauteur de ce que sait faire madonna et cela depuis plus de 20 ans ."
5,"N'étant pas fan de la madone je suis agréablement surpris par ce nouvel opus qui me semble plus abouti que son prédécesseur ""music"" un peu trop machinal à mon gout,ici les cordes ainsi que la guitare ont un role plus important et c'est tant mieux. La plus grande surprise de ce disque est sans doute le très folk ""x-static process"" qui prouve que la sobriété va très bien à madonna."
1,"Evidement je ne suis pas trés objectif , n'etant pas du tout un fan de Madonna ni des musiques style rap,hip hop,dance,RnB (petit apparté pour dire que ce que l'on nomme de nos jours RnB n'a plus rien a voir avec le rhytm and blues original , celui des maitres Marvin gaye,Otis Redding ou aretha Franklin, aux Usa le terme designe maintenant la black musique qu'elle soit funk, soul, disco,rap, hip hop et en France , on entend par RnB les nouvelles musiques populaires noires americaines issues de la culture hip hop/rap).Ayant -peniblement -ecouté des extraits de ce disque, je n'arrive toujours pas a comprendre le succés de Madonna:une fois de plus elle copie un style dans l'air du temps, sans aucune originalité ni créativité, on a l'impression d'ecouter le meme morceau du debut a la fin, caractéristique d'ailleurs de ces musique ou tous les artistes produisent la meme chose a la chaine. Mais puisque ca se vend , pourquoi chercher a se differencier; Madonna va en vendre des millions sur son nom...sans doute un des  plus sur-evalués de l'histoire de la musique populaire(avec Michael Jackson et quelques autres).Mais avec une major derriere,une grosse machine commerciale et mediatique , une vie sulfureuse-soit disant,car là encore c'est du marketing- et des medias qui ne vont pas chercher plus loin que ce que ces majors leur donnent, on peut faire prendre les vessies pour des lanternes..."
2,"bien dommage que cette belle intégrale soit entachée de défauts techniques majeurs (bug dans ""l'Ile des morts"", déjà signalée par des acheteurs, je ne suis pas allé voir dans ""Aleko""...)"
4,"même si tout là dedans n'est pas du meilleur Callas, à ce prix,on se précipite: c'est le prix de trois CD vendus hors intégrale.On peut offrir un   cadeau formidable à plusieurs amis différents, sans se ruiner.Petits bémols: j'aurais préféré payer un peu plus pour avoir un cartonnage rigide,et surtout, un CD-Rom pour le MAC n'aurait pas été du luxe!"
5,"Wish you were here est à écouter en le replaçant dans son contexte : il suit Dark Side Of The Moon. Une fois que l'on sait cela, l'hommage des 4 Floyd à leur membre fondateur devient plus émouvant. Ils sont devenus des stars du rock, il est devenu fou. Pourtant les paroles de Waters commencent à sentir le souffre. Désorientés par le succès de Dark Side les 4 se retournent sur leurs débuts sans que leur créativité faiblisse. Au contraire cette nostalgie désabusée de leurs débuts semble les motiver. Le mixage fait la part belle aux nappes de toutes formes qui façonnent le son de cet album en laissant la première place méritée à la guitare de David Gilmour. Le jeu de ce dernier coule comme du miel dans les oreilles. Les Floyd sont toujours au sommet en 1975, ils commenceront à faiblir avec Animals (1977)dont les musiques ont du mal à suivre les paroles (presque trop) cyniques de Waters."
4,"Considéré comme une oeuvre magistrale, The Wall à tout de même quelques défauts, si on les considère comme tels. En effet l'omniprésence de Waters en fait presque un album solo dans lequel le bassiste à oublié le talent de ses comparses et les transforme en musiciens de studio (3 titres seulements sont co-écrits). De plus la noirceur des textes égocentriques fini par lasser. Il reste quand même de grands moments qui prouvent que Pink Floyd était au dessus de la mélée."
5,"Peut être l'album du siècle. Plus on le connaît, plus on l'aime. Ce groupe avait bien compris qu'un album est d'abord un tout dont chaque chanson dépend des autres. Voilà pourquoi un best of de Pink Floyd est une aberration. Alors si en plus chaque morceau est un monument... Le thème de Breathe qui revient pas mal dans l'album procure un bien être paradisiaque. On The Run rappelle qu'ils font parti des précurseurs de la musique électronique (ainsi que tous les bruitages). Les 2 morceaux vraiment rock sont excellents : Time et Money qui malgré sa réputation d'intrus dans l'album, a largement sa place. Dans cet album il y a peut être aussi la meilleure chanson jamais entendue : The Great Gig In The Sky. C'est en tout cas la plus émouvante que je connaisse. L'analogie avec un orgasme est également frappante. Us And Them est presque aussi touchante avec un refrain d'une puissance rare. Enfin l'apothéose avec Brain Damage (the lunatic is on the grass) et Eclipse qui clôture triomphalement l'album."
1,"Le groupe Hype du moment devant lequel tout le monde se prosterne. Ils me font penser un peu à Beck. Vous vous rappelez de Beck ? le mec qui devait changer l'avenir de la musique pop ! Il est où , hein maintenant Beck ?  Là c'est un peu la même démarche: ouahh et si j'appuie sur ce bouton , ça fait quoi ? Yeah Dude ! très Syd Barrett ! Et sur celui-là ? Whaouu trop King Crimson!!  Au final une voix plus que banale à la Supergrass qui passe son temps à vouloir imiter le Bowie d'Hunky Dory :  Le fameux premier single ""révolutionnaire"" évoque Blur époque girls and boys . Le son est sans réelle épaisseur .  Quant à la pochette ..... Brice de Nice version purple rain....  La deuxième chanson emprunte sans vergogne au Melody Nelson de Gainsbourg et tente un refrain façon kinks .  Le troisième est un horrible morceau disco ( on avait déjà Franz Ferdinand , merci du cadeau .....) .  Les trois derniers morceaux sont complètement imbuvables (normal c'est du sel de mer...ah ah ....).  Pour un duo vraiment original , prière de s'orienter vers The Kills et pour les expérimentations sonores on est vraiment très loin de ce que font Christophe et Trent Reznor en studio.  Ps :faîtes un petit tour sur Youtube, vous verrez sur N'IMPORTE QUELLE VIDEO que le groupe n'assure pas une cacahouete en live et semble même s'ennuyer ferme sur sa propre musique!! Si ces deux jobards sont censés incarner le futur de la pop , NO FUTURE !!"
1,"Les chef d'oeuvres musicaux existent, c'est certain sinon il n'y aurait jamais de note maximale. Mais à l'autre bout de la chaîne alimentaire, on trouve d'autres production de qualité : les nanards. Soit de la musique particulièrement nulle, mais en même temps particulièrement drôle. Ceux-là récoltent entre 2 et 3 étoiles, voir 4 si je suis dans un bon jour. Mais, tout en bas de l'échelle de richter, il y a les navets. Soit des albums suffisamment nuls pour ne pas prétendre arriver à la cheville du plus mauvais Neil Young, d'un autre côté suffisamment ennuyeux et prétentieux pour n'éveiller en vous la moindre sympathie. Là se pose Definitely Maybe. C'est ...posé, prétentieux, banal et convenu au possible. Aussi passionnant qu'écouter les cours de la bourse et plus prévisible que l'addition au supermarché. La voix du chanteur donnerait de l'urticaire à n'importe quel homme un tant soi peu mélomane. Seules 3 choses sont à sauver :  la ballade sucrée Live Forever, le tube radio Supersonic qu'il faut avoir écouté sous peine de passer pour un ermite au fond de sa caverne et surtout, surtout, une production en béton. La production est énorme. Du coup ce groupe a cru sans doute l'être aussi. Grossière erreur. Bref, une oeuvre horripilante dont on ferait bien de m'expliquer l'intérêt car il m'est complètement passé au dessus de la tête."
5,"A la recherche de la perfection, le groupe de Bristol ne s'est pas perdu. Les 10 pistes musicales  vous mènent tout droit au rêve, à la mélancolie ou à la folie.  Des vibrations à découvrir en se laissant porter par les rythmes ensorcelant et parfois déroutant de génies des sensations. Du Portish-plein la tête qui vous fait triper et hop vous êtes bien. Merci Porti..."
5,"Coming between Rubber soul, the first album in which they started to change their style, and Sergeant Pepper, this album was very important in the Beatles' career. It included three great songs (Taxman, Love you to, I want to tell you) by George Harrison, showing his progress as a songwriter. Even so, all the really important songs here are by John Lennon and Paul McCartney."
1,"J'ai une infinie admiration pour le chanteur que l'on voit à peine sur la pochette, caché sous sa giga chakpa avec ses grandes lunettes dans la pénombre... Ben justement, c'est pareil en écoutant l'album ! Où est-il ? Sa voix trafiquée, torturée, triturée, reste enfouie sous le bruit (ne parlons pas de musique). Certes, c'est un projet électro, cohérent et très bien produit. Mais pour quoi faire ? Tuer l'émotion ? « Inventaire » était plus désordonné mais assez concluant. « Caféine » est bien moins stimulant. C'est souvent du réchauffé : ""Entre nous et le sol"" n'est qu'une resucée de Britney Spears en français. Ailleurs, ""Sensitized"" est piqué à Kylie Minogue qui avait elle-même pompé (!) sur Gainsbourg.  Zazie apparaît aussi peu inspirée : entre ""yaourt et lavabo"", elle semble chercher ses mots et fait bégayer Willem sur ""la demande"". C'est marrant ; sans plus. Puisque le rythme prime définitivement sur le texte, le cadavre exquis en franglais ""trash"" parvient quand même à se distinguer. Même le single ""Berlin"" ne semble pas aussi efficace. Seul le premier titre dont on a faussement isolé l'intro pour faire une piste de plus, ""l'homme en noir"", laisse entrevoir ce qu'aurait donné le projet s'il avait réussi. Car toute la saveur et la personnalité du grand interprète se retrouvent ensuite dissolues dans une soupe électro qui lorgne sur les productions anglo-saxonnes sans jamais parvenir à leurs chevilles. Au final « caféine » ne laisse qu'un goût amer de ratage. Café bouillu, café foutu. Tant pis. Allez, Christophe ! Sans rancune, j'attends le prochain service avec impatience !"
1,"Coffret société de conso!! 20 CD de musique baroque en version démodée.... Je donnerais un conseil, pas aux mélomanes (je ne me le permettrais pas) mais aux amateurs : toujours privilégier la qualité à la quantité! La quantité c'est pour les amateurs ou les ""mastuvu"", qui souhaitent remplir leur CDthèque de CD dont les interprétations sont déjà dépassées pour pouvoir montrer à leur petits copains péteux d'auvergne qu'ils ont de la musique baroque dans leur placard! 1 grande oeuvre baroque, à réécouter dans ses moindres détails, interprétée dignement, procurera 10 fois plus de plaisir que ce coffret! PAr curiosité, j'avais investi dans cette daube, et l'ai rendu plus vite que mon ombre!!! Conseiller ce coffret, c'est ou bien ne rien comprendre à la Musique, ou bien ne pas savoir comment occuper sa journée!"
5,"Les sonates de Haydn, c'est le terreau sur lequel à poussé l'œuvre pianistique de Beethoven. Rien que pour cela elles sont intéressantes. Il existe des intégrales passionnantes comme celle de  .  Pour une sélection, deux indispensables : -  , mais c'est un Haydn vu par un interprète excentrique, c'est plus vraiment du Haydn, moi j'adore cette liberté, surtout quand le résultat est aussi bon. - Alfred Brendel : Avec lui toute l'influence de Haydn sur Beethoven est mis à jour. Cet immense interprète plutôt cérébral joue à la perfection ces sonates et nous fait découvrir tout le génie de Haydn. Introverti mais pas trop, tout en nuances, l'écoute est magique tout au long des 4 CD et plus on l'écoute plus l'univers de Haydn nous apparait passionnant. Brendel est en quelque sorte un guide et un professeur, merci a lui pour m'avoir fait découvrir toutes ces merveilles (et pas seulement Haydn) Ecoutez l'andante avec variations, à chaque fois je crois entendre l'immense Beethoven ! Haydn + Brendel = l'entente parfaite (l'osmose)"
5,"Donnez à une soprano, un orchestre et un premier violon de très haute voltige un programme qui leur va comme un gant, et voici le résultat! Tout est justesse et émotion, avec une bonne dose d'italianità. S. Piau allie fougue et raffinement, et c'est divin. Un indispensable pour tout amateur de musique baroque."
1,"Reservé à un public averti nous prévient on sur la jacquette de ce cd...oui, averti qu'il va trouver là une bouillie electro/dance/hip hop / rap sur 38 morceaux identiques et un veritable concentré de la soupe pré-machée jetable que nous balancent à flots continus les télés (Mtv, virgin etc) et   commerciales à cible du jeune et influencable public afin de bien le formater à leurs produits.Une musique vidée de tout son sens, aussi glacée que ces starlettes de pacotille clonées,   avant d'etre chanteuses  ou artistes, et  repetitive et creuse , denuée de toute créativité , donc bien à l'image de  . Un petit rappel de ce que veut dire ""ereneubi "" s'impose je crois..  ce que l'on nomme de nos jours RnB n'a plus rien a voir avec le rhytm and blues original , celui des maitres Marvin gaye,Otis Redding,Wilson Pickett ou aretha Franklin, aux Usa le terme designe maintenant la black musique qu'elle soit funk, soul, disco,rap, hip hop et en France , on entend par RnB les nouvelles musiques populaires noires americaines issues de la culture hip hop/rap. Je demande donc solonellement aux editeurs et diffuseurs de musique de trouver un autre terme pour ce courant musical et de ne plus salir le vrai Rythm&amp;Blues en y associant son nom.. Quant aux malheureux qui pourraient etre tentés  par ce produit je ne peux que les diriger vers ces 3 petits bijoux issus des grands labels du Rythm &amp; Blues , , ; ils devraient voir la différence et ne pas le regretter.."
1,J'aimais beaucoup les originaux.... Des monuments de la SOUL !! Très déçue par ces reprises.. Chapeau à la Maison de Production qui s'en est fichue plein les fouilles et SEAL idem !!
1,Quel est l'intérêt de ce type de disque si ce n'est relancer une carrière?... Et ça marche ! Je conseille d'écouter les originaux au lieu d'écouter un artiste qui a comme originalité d'en manquer et de nous refaire des interprétations à l'identique.. Sauf que n'est pas James Brown qui veut...
2,"Pochette inspirée de Lolita , Katy Perry à 25 ans , n'en a déjà plus l'âge. On lui est quand même reconnaissant de ne pas avoir eu le culot d'intituler comme Pink son nouvel album Funhouse (les rockers de Detroit me comprendront...) Oh certes , c'est bien calibré FM et on ne risque pas de la voir monter un jour sur scène avec Iggy Pop ( quoique... il a bien pris les Palstiscines en première partie de son concert ) ou Alan Vega ( quoique... le chanteur de Suicide est fan ..... de Céline Dion ....) Bon bref , vous m'avez compris !!! Réplique tardive US à Lily Allen avec qui elle partage un physique identique et le même timbre de voix (cf ""you re so gay"" ) , la donzelle chante correctement sur les 5 titres qui valent la peine d'être retenus. Mais ces titres restent très plaisants malgré des paroles complétement débiles et faussement provocateurs ( J'ai embrassé une fille / j'ai aimé celà / J'espère que mon copain ne m'en voudra pas / ) . Pourquoi ? tout simplement parce que musicalement et vocalement , Katy Perry s'est largement inspirée de Gwenn Stefani à l'époque où elle faisit un Rock péchu et enthousiaste avec No Doubt( et non pas racaille de Beverly Hills avec son dernier album solo....). Il suffit d'écouter ""Im still Breathing"" pour se demander si Stefani ne chante pas dans les choeurs. Bref un produit innofensif , idéal pour ceux qui aiment la pop teenage décaféiné . Les autres jetteront une oreille sur les Ting Tings ( un peu) plus interressants."
5,"Je ne comprends pas ces mauvaises critiques ?! Madonna a pris un risque avec cet album et en travaillant avec des producteurs R&amp;B alors que ce n'est pas son style de musique . Cet album se releve finalement plus intelligent et ambitieux que la pochette -immonde- pourrait le laisser penser. l'ensemble est cohérent et dansant, et chose surprenante, elle chante mieux que sur les derniers albums ( morceaux : She's not me, miles away, voices, dance 2 night)  . Même si on reste dans le commercial, Madonna ose, et aprés 25 ans de carriere, elle ne reste pas enfermée indefinimemt dans un style; et c'est tant mieux !"
1,"Akon si dit être héritier de Michael Jackson alors qu'il ne sait pas chanter juste, il ne sait pas écrire, il ne sait pas composer, il ne sait même pas danser ... Honnêtement que ceux qui apprécient Akon me disent ce qu'il sait faire, parce que j'ai beau écouté je ne trouve pas !!! Et sinon pour information dans la presse spécialisée on en parle pas, pourquoi ? Simplement parce qu'il s'agit d'un pur produit marketing destiné à ceux qui n'y connaissent rien en musique, un conseil écoutez Sly and the Family Stone, même les titres les plus connus, et vouz verrez que même 40 ans avant la musique était déjà plus évoluée, et au moins on ils savaient chanter juste ... Et pour info le r'n'b était une musique très populaire dans les années 50, si vous croyez que le r'n'b est une musique apparue dans les années 80 ou 90 c'est qu'il faudrait développer un peu votre culture musicale !!!"
5,"X-Tina est de retour et je dois avouer que ça fait bcp de bien !!!! Après le très réussi ""Stripped"", ""Back To Basics"" tient les mêmes promesses dans un tout autre style qui lui va également à merveille: une voix puissante et magnifique mise en valeur par des musiques rétro ... Christina Aguilera ... le retour !!! Que la France ne la boude pas cette fois ... sinon c'est passer à côté d'un phénomène !"
5,"Du fait que Shakira est une Colombienne d'origine libanaise elle porte dans son sang un mélange de culture qu'elle restitue magnifiquement en musique. Fille prodige, elle écrit et met en musique sa première chanson à 14 ans. Ses précédents albums était en Espagnole et essentiellement composés de rock latin. Aujourd'hui elle innove en chantant en anglais pour la première fois et en ajoutant un son plus pop à sa musique dans le but certain de conquérir le reste du globe ! Et çà marche ! Ses cheveux (initialement noirs) passent de rouges à blonds !  Armée d'une voix exceptionelle (rare sont les chanteuses capables comme elle de jouer et de moduler avec leur voix), d'une beauté evidente, et d'une musique nouvelle elle se lance dans la conquète du marché internationale. Shakira est une vrai artiste par le fait qu'elle écrit la plupart des textes et la musique de ses chansons (""Objection"" par exemple a été intégralement écrite par la belle). Avec le support de Gloria Estefan rien ne peut l'arreter ! Son chef d'oeuvre ""Laundry service"" (""Blanchisserie"" en français) est composé de 11 chansons en Anglais et des versions espagnoles de ""Whenever, Wherever (La version espagnole se nomme ""Suerte"") et de ""Objection"" (La version espagnole se nomme ""Te aviso te anuncio""). Il contient aussi la reprise en anglais d'un des meilleurs titres de son album précédent : ""Ojos asi"" (qui se nomme ""Eyes like yours"" en anglais). C'est une chanson aux accents très orientaux, irrésistible ! Si ""Whenever, Wherever"" parait un peu commerciale, il n'en est rien du reste de l'album qui est davantage à l'éffigie de ""Underneath your clothes"" et du fameux ""Objection"" pimenté de tango. A noter le superbe ""The one"" et l'excellent ""Poem to a horse"" sans oublier ""Ready for the good times"" qui sonne très dance !"
1,"Dur, dur d'écouter cette BOF quand on a adoré la première. Déprimante, et sombre, beaucoup moins ""punchy"" que la première voici ce qu'elle m'a inspiré. Pas vraiment envie de la réécouter, même si certains morceaux sont vraiment pas mal. Peut-être que le film me donnera plus envie, mais bon je n'en suis pas sûre. Dommage ..."
1,"Je me suis procuré le dernier Laurent Voulzy, c'est une catastrophe! Une vraie faute de goût... Les rares moments ""nouveaux"" sont d'insipides rengaines. Comptez 38 mn de karaoké nul, Voulzy a un accent anglais digne d'un élève de 4ème (il faut qu'il arrête de chanter en anglais, définitivement!), et 7 mn de liant sans âme ni mélodie, le tout avec un son 80's du plus mauvais goût. C'est navrant et c'est encore un rdv manqué! Et dire que je l'aimais tant le lolo...! PS: le DVD avec le scopitone archi-revu de Rockcollection, c'est tout ce que la maison de disque a été capable d'offrir aux fans?"
1,"Ne pas revenir sur la qualité intrinsèque du son. La mauvaise foi doit rester dans la poche prévue à cet effet. Ne pas nourrir les quolibets faciles, ceux qui consistent à ressortir les bonnes vieilles vannes au sujet des varièteries faciles de notre Lolo... Changer les âmes avec des fleurs, okay, même Neil Young n'aurait pas osé en 1970. Outre ces considérations dont on s'interdit l'exagération, revenons sur le caractère involontairement drolatique (voire provocateur) de l'énième faux come-back de notre Schtroumpf-à-lunettes-Antillais-de-coeur. Il s'est encore fichu d'nous ! Mais si ! C'te blague même pas drôle ! Même pas repenti de sa farce du début du siècle, souvenez-vous, ""la fille d'avril ne se découvre pas d'un fil"", ce genre... après son album de cover tout aussi culotté dans la catégorie ""il nous a ENCORE bien eus"", le revoici avec un disque fier de n'en être pas un nouveau (on a fini par s'y habituer) ! Ainsi, RECOLLETiON recolle (sic) des morceaux qui avaient dû être sacrément abîmés puis oubliés dans un tiroir... Notre Lolo a dû se dire qu'il y avait prescription, qu'il pouvait cesser de dissimuler ses anciennes compositions non-utilisées dans ses archives de secours ! ""30 ans, Rockollection !"", lui a dit son attachée de presse. Allez Lolo, dis oui ! Je ne sais pas encore si le plus inconditionnel de notre Lucien national saura lui pardonner ce troisième mauvais gag consécutif, mais une chose est sûre : c'est là que réside sa prise de risque. Pas grave, on va se venger en écoutant ""Bubble Star"" et ""Bopper En Larmes"", comme pour protester contre cette facilité de trop qu'est ""Recollection"". Et pourtant, qu'est-ce qu'on adore l'écouter parler aux émissions TV ! Tu vois, Lolo Mac Carnet, on t'en veut pas tant qu'ça..."
1,"Sans doute faut il etre  tres jeune pour trouver un interet a ce disque, mais si vous avez plus de 8 ans et appreciez ce genre de productions, votre cas est grave! Christophe est mignon et plait aux trés jeunes filles ,  et justement ses textes sont destinés aux pré ados, quant aux musiques, elles sont d'une banalité affligeante et je ne parle pas de la voix, insupportable plus de dix secondes!On a vraiment l'impression d'ecouter en boucle la meme chanson du debut a la fin, ideal pour supermarchés ou ascenceurs...Et dire que dans sa bio  on peut lire  que ses idoles sont stevie wonder , marvin gaye et otis redding, lol. Encore un sous produit issu de comedies musicales niaises et qu'on essaie de nous vendre pour un artiste!Non, vraiment cet album est un fléau..à conseiller a vos ennemis.."
2,"Je suis un fan de Nathalie Dessay pour ses enregistrements de Mozart, d'opéras français: Lakmé, contes d'Hoffman... Ici, je ne ressens pas l'émotion attendue."
2,"Avec un piano? Par ailleurs, je ne savais pas qu'il fallait rajouter de la poésie aux oeuvres de Bach tant elles en étaient dépourvues... Les clavecinistes actuels ne sont plus des activateurs de machines à coudre mais des artistes dont les instruments sonnent merveilleusement. Cependant, s'il y a encore des amateurs pour ce genre de disque que l'on peut désigner pudiquement comme faisant partie de la ""grande tradition""... pourquoi pas! Essayez Suzuki et son clavecin, vous verrez comment on arrive à phraser avec finesse et poésie avec l'instrument d'origine."
1,"Cet objet marketing laisse plus que songeur.. ce n'est pas seulement le fait que M. Jaroussky semble de tromper de registre (après tout pourquoi pas, soyons aventureux). Le répertoire choisi ne fait tout simplement pas honneur aux talents de M. Jaroussky (manque d'intérêt souvent total, une bonne surprise cependant: le Hahn). Une chose de remarquable toutefois: Jérome Ducros est un pianiste et un accompagnateur formidable que l'on aimerait entendre plus souvent!"
1,"ou comment le marketing fait prendre des vessies pour des lanternes.Philippe Jaroussky a tout à fait le droit d'enregistrer ces airs, mais de là à prétendre que l'on ressuscite l'art d'un des plus grands chanteurs du 18ème! Il faudrait un volume sonore, une palette de couleurs vocales, un mordant et une agilité dans la voix que le chanteur est bien loin de posséder. C'est un disque prétentieux servi par un chanteur en définitive médiocre. C'est terriblement agaçant(comme les autres enregistrements  du même artiste) mais heureusement les chanteurs sérieux qui font antidote à ce type de disques ne manquent pas. Eva Podles, Horne, Baker, Montague, Cencic ont gravé quelques uns des titres sur lesquels s'époumonne Jaroulssky avec sa voix fluette.On pourra comparer avec profit."
5,"La musique de Bach a beau être profondément liée au XVIIIe siècle, elle contient parfois de façon latente une vertigineuse puissance romantique. La Chaconne étant l'emblème de ce romantisme latent, Brahms, Busoni et, plus tard, Lutz ont entrepris, chacun à sa manière et de façon très différente, de la transcrire pour le piano: Brahms a choisi la fidélité et la simplicité, Busoni le déploiement quasi symphonique et Lutz les innovations harmoniques. Edna Stern interprète chacune de ces transcriptions de façon assez admirable en préférant la profondeur du son et la largeur des tempi à la pure virtuosité. Pour clore ce disque remarquable, Amandine Beyer interprète de façon très convaincante la Chaconne dans sa version originale pour violon baroque. Un enregistrement passionnant."
1,"Fan de Muse depuis le debut, j'ai étais vraiment deçu par cet album. C'est de la soupe pour vendre vraiment indigeste.Si vous voulez les decouvrir, acheter leur 2 premiers albums qui valent vraiment le coup."
5,"Un pure plaisir de retrouver Emilie Simon dans ce coffret magnifique !!! Un grand changement au niveau musical, moins timide et poétique qu'avant mais il y a toujours la touche Simon, le plus important !!!!"
1,"Un opus qui signe la fin d'une époque? Cet album est de loin le plus mauvais du groupe, on y retrouve des sons des albums precedent mais sans âme, du copié mal collé, un virage mal négocié, limite kitch de mauvaise qualité. A déconseiller."
2,"Après un dernier album pas franchement révolutionnaire, on attendait Placebo au tournant. Placebo, emmenés par l'androgyne Brian Molko, idole de ces jeunes demoiselles, semble faire du surplace depuis quelques années, se cantonnant à rester dans ce qui fait recette, une pop énergique très accessible. Mais voilà, à force de tourner, la mayonnaise finit par avoir un gout douteux. Hélas, Meds est bien loin du compte. Autant Sleeping with Ghosts comprenait quelques bons titres, autant Meds en est dispensé. L'anécdotique est le maitre-mot de ce nouvel album très décevant. Les ultra-fans apprécieront peut-être mais les autres, passez votre chemin. Tournez vous plutôt vers les premiers albums, bien plus convaincants."
5,"Découverte dans une vidéo du chorégraphe Philippe Découflé, la sublime chanson ""la musique adoucit les moeurs"" m'avait immédiatement séduit par sa trompeuse simplicité et sa limpide musicalité...  Réentendue, plus tard, dans Iris du même Découflé, j'avais pu apprecier la magique et lumineuse noirceur d'""Infidèle"", sur laquelle planait la divine ombre de la grande Kate B. Cette voix avait tout ce qu'il faut pour attirer mon attention... singulière, étrange, moderne... Ces textes ,superbes cousins des univers que j'affectionne (Camille,  Albin De La Simone, etc.)... L'album est à la très grande hauteur de cette première impression : une grande artiste est née, puissante, vocale, musicale, audacieuse et nouvelle, vraiment...  Un univers expérimental jamais élitiste ni excluant, ""Claire"" comme de l'eau de roche, lumineux, évident et envoutant...  Indispensable !"
2,"d'abord il y a la voix de Luz Cazal qui ne peut laisser indiffèrent personne. C'est une voix sensuelle,expressive,émouvante.Toutes les chansons de ce cd sont agréables à écouter,très belle musique très bonne orchestration.C'est un parcours sans faute, que du plaisir du début jusqu'à la fin."
5,"Que dire à part que les deux album sont géniaux, que j'aime autant la musique que les paroles. Certaines me font mourire de rire et d'autre me font pleurer à chaque fois que je les ecoute... Vraiment s'il y a bien un chanteur francais de la nouvelle génération qui merite une place d'honneur c'est bien Vincent Delerm!!!! franchement cette voix... douce et envoutante me fais vibrer à tout les coups. A quand le prochain???? merci en tout cas de nous aporter autant d'émotions."
1,"Après le com sans titre et le titre sans com, je voulais écrire un jour une chronique sans titre ET sans commentaire afin d'illustrer la forme absolue de néant artistique que représenterai une « oeuvre » ; ce dernier album de l'ineffable Pascal me semble le produit adéquat...""                                   ."""
1,"Un premier préalable doit être posé. Je n'ai rien contre Grégoire. Rien pour, non plus, d'ailleurs. Il existe et il vend des disques. Il faut faire avec, ou plutôt sans. C'est ontologique comme dirait Michel Onfray, qui est son alter ego en philosophie. On ne peut donc pas plus lui en vouloir qu'on en voudrait à une palourde, une courge, ou un protozoaire d'être ce qu'ils sont. Quoiqu'à la réflexion, les deux premiers cités présentent quelque intérêt, gustativement parlant.  Deuxième préalable. Grégoire vend des disques. À qui ? Quand on examine les commentaires sur ce site, ils sont majoritairement négatifs, voire très négatifs. Où sont ses adorateurs ? Il ne manque pourtant pas de critiques dithyrambiques pour les plus consternantes productions musicales, cinématographiques ou littéraires dont l'époque est prodigue. Bien. Je n'ai pas écouté le disque de Grégoire. J'ai autre chose à faire. Et il y a tellement d'autres choses à écouter. Même raisonnement que plus haut. On n'a pas besoin de manger du surimi pour savoir que ça va être infect, ou d'aller voir Camping 2, par exemple pour savoir que ça va être le degré zéro du cinéma.  Le problème est très simple. Le dénommé Grégoire est une erreur. Une erreur de casting, comme il y en a dans absolument tous les domaines, à tel point qu'on peut se demander si ce n'est pas la nouvelle donne. Au hasard, Jean-Pierre Pernaut est-il un journaliste, Amélie Nothomb, un écrivain, Djamel un comique, la techno de la musique, le Breton un homme comme les autres... ? Grégoire n'a manifestement, je ne vais pas parler de talent, ce serait faire injure à ceux qui en ont, aucune aptitude musicale ou d'écriture. Il est le produit d'Internet (où on en trouve des milliers comme lui, parfois même en pire), du relativisme culturel (tout vaut tout), du narcissisme ambiant ( tout le monde a du talent, tout le monde doit s'exprimer, blogs, Facebook...etc, surtout ceux, et ils sont nombreux, qui n'ont rien à dire), de l'indigence intellectuelle de ses contemporains. Dans un an, il sera totalement oublié, et on sera passé à autre chose.  Merci qui?"
2,Ce n'est pas l'album que j'attendais malgré quelques morceaux qui ne m'ont pas laissé de marbre mais pas autant d'émotions que dans les précédents.Dommage.Je pense que cet album n'aura pas le même impact que le précédent.
1,"Ce CD comme, de plus en plus, est protégé par un système destiné à empêcher tout acheteur de disposer à sa guise de ce qu'il a légalement acheté (en faire une copie pour son autoradio, le passer en mp3 pour son baladeur, etc.). En conséquence, je n'acheterai pas ce CD aussi bon fut-il."
2,"Contrairement aux autres commentaires, la seule chanson qui sort un peu du lot pour moi est ""it's over"". Le reste me paraît fort pauvre après quelques écoutes. L'album précédent était à mon sens bien meilleur. On retrouve ici des chansons ""pop"" sans âme, je suis très déçu, j'attendais bien plus de ce disque après les très bonnes dernières prestations live de ce début d'année."
1,"J'ai essayé de comprendre l'effet Didier Super, j'ai écouté, j'ai regardé les vidéos, j'ai re écouté, définitivement je ne trouve pas ça interessant, c'est raciste, pauvre, ecoeurant, vulgaire, j'ai lu des articles de gens qui pensent qu'il y a plusieurs degrés, ... je les cherche, si seulement il revendiquait quelque chose, ou si la démarche avait du sens, meme pas. Il y en a pour trouver ça super, ... oui ils doivent avoir raison, on se rapproche du vrai ! CD à bannir"
2,Déçue par ce CD que nous avons attendu avec impatience. C'est une suite de chansons sans relief et monotones rien à voir avec D'eux... Il se vendra bien sur à beaucoup d'exemplaires mais franchement on s'attendait à mieux.
5,"Mettez d'urgence cet album dans votre panier ! Thomas Dutronc nous offre du trés haut niveau. C'est frais, mélodique et aboutie. Un grand guitariste mais surtout un vrai et grand artiste. A mon sens il va devenir aussi essentiel dans l'histoire de la musique Française que son illustre pere ..."
1,"A quoi sert de ressortir un disque vingt cinq ans plus tard avec des reprises tartes, des nouveautés sans saveur, et un prix destiné à rembourser les dettes de Bambi. Deux objectifs : compenser les vides de l'imagination ( raté, ça se voit ) et remplir les caisses sans travail ( amoral, et, nous esperons, raté, sans en être bien surs) A éviter, comme toute arnaque."
5,"J'ai découvert Mika - comme beaucoup de personnes? - via le Grand Journal, et j'ai adoré dès les premières notes. L'album nous fait vivre un grand moment de bonheur: capable de nous faire passer de l'exaltation(Relax; Grace Kelly) à l'émotion (Happy ending; Any other world) en dix titres...  Les références à certains ""grands"" ne sont pas volés : he's really ""got a little Freddy""! :-) Mais le talent est là. Je suis une grande fan de musique, mais j'ai rarement des coups de coeur aussi forts que celui-ci! Seul petit regret: que ce soit juste un peu trop court..."
5,"Cet album est une vraie merveille. La musique est féerique, la voix de Simon Buret nous transporte à des années-lumières de notre petit monde. On entre dans une nouvelle dimension à l'écoute de ce disque: un univers mélancolique mais tellement pur! A écouter et à réecouter à l'infini!"
2,"J'aime beaucoup Calogero, j'ai beaucoup apprécié ses précédents albums mais là... que dire ? Déjà, j'ai eu l'impression que l'album ne comprenait qu'une ou deux chansons déclinées de façon un peu différentes mais très similaires. Quant aux paroles, aïe, certains titres sont à la limite du ridicule avec des jeux de mots incroyablement stupides et indignes de la musique de Calo (ex. : ""Sur ma console je m'envole Et pour de faux, je vis des hauts"". ). Moi, ça ne me fait pas rire... Ma conclusion ? On dirait un album réalisé sur entre potes sur un coup de tête. Genre, des idées lachées en qq minutes lors d'une réunion dans un café (Game Over, Pomme C, etc.), qq heures de boulot (je suis gentil...) pour écrire ça sur une serviette en papier et on enregistre... A n'acheter que si vous êtes absolument inconditionnel."
1,"Depuis près de 30 ans Prince a fait du bon du moins bon, du très bon du mauvais, de l'excellent du très mauvais, du génial du nullissime, mais avec 3121 il commet l'un de ses pires opus. Cet album est une suite de titres parfaitement produits mais dénués de la moindre originalité. Des chansons d'une mièvrerie ahurissante, des morceaux comme on en entend toute la journée sur toutes les radios et toutes les télés pour ados. A l'écoute, 3121 ressemble beaucoup plus à une Bande Originale de clip qu'à un album.  Peut-être 3121 est-il l'album du come back commercial de Prince mais, pour moi, ce n'est pas l'album de son Come Back artistique, et qualitatif."
1,"Limp Bizkit semble ici affaibli. Beaucoup de ballades, peu de métal, du rap tout mou et tout basique... Ils ne sont pas au meilleur de leur forme. A déconseiller ceux qui chez Limp Bizkit aimaient la pêche, la rage et les riffs rebondissants qu'ils possédaient autrefois. Les fans de Nickelback y trouveront ptett leur compte ;-)"
5,"Un très très beau moment d'écoute, tout en sensibilité et en sérénité, un cd qui plaira ux fans mais aussi aux nouveaux arrivants, même mes enfants, bercés dans la musique plus électro et bouboum adorent ! c'est un disque pour les long trajets en voiture, pour les soirée d'hiver au coin du feu, pour regarder la pluie tomber sur les carreaux pour mettre un bon fond musicale lors d'une soirée d'été, pour s'éveiller, pour s'endormir, pour passer un moment intime avec l'être aimé. Un album qui nous rappelle à chaque phrase que la musique est l'art universel."
5,"Enfin un artiste de R&amp;B français qui se démarque des Willy Denzey, Wallen, Jalane et autres Leslie... Son album est vraiment magnifique, avec des bijoux comme ""Parce qu'on vient de loin"", ""Seul au monde"" ou ""Sans rancune"". Les textes sont vraiment tous très prennants de réalisme et nous permettent très bien de comprendre le passé dramatique qu'il a vécu. Avec Afrodiziac, Corneille est sans doûte un des trop rares artistes à faire du R&amp;B français de ""grande classe"".  Cet album est incontestablement un des plus réussis de l'année, et Corneille n'a pas à rougir face à la concurrence américaine Bravo Corneille !"
4,"Beaucoup de gens pensent que division bell n'est qu'une fade réminiscence de ce que fut PF. Il est vrai que l'exubérance délirante du temps de syd barret et de roger waters est loin. Néanmoins, peu de groupes restent capables de produire des ?uvres de cette qualité après plus de 30 ans d'existence.  Ce disque offre un rendu très homogène et donne à entendre une musique qui s'insinue délicieusement en soi sans jamais décevoir. Il n'y a pas de morceau de bravoure, mais il n'y a pas de faiblesse. Les albums passés de PF n'évitaient pas toujours une certaine grandiloquence, et surtout recelaient de grandes irrégularités qui faisaient que le meilleur côtoyait parfois le pire. Avec le trio actuel et l'influence évidente de david gilmour, l'objectif est différent. L'ensemble est très cohérent et admirablement peaufiné. Les mélodies qui n'ont l'air de rien, sont très prégnantes et ne sont pas sans rappeler, en moins flamboyant, le lyrisme de "" dark side of the moon "" qui reste le chef d'oeuvre du groupe. L'élégance et la fluidité du jeu de guitare de gilmour font souvent merveille et s'accordent très bien avec les claviers élégants de richard wright. Il faut enfin souligner le grand respect que PF manifeste pour son public. La dernière vidéo du groupe "" pulse "", reprenant certains des titres ici présents, est une pure merveille et tarde vraiment à voir le jour en dvd.  En fin de compte, et malgré l'éclatement de la formation, pink floyd reste à ce jour le plus grand des groupes en activité, issu des années soixante et il faut souhaiter qu'il nous livre encore quelques productions de ce niveau. Rien que pour cela, le disque mérite bien 4 étoiles."
2,"Après leur séparation en 1982, leur vrai-faux retour en 1994, le procès Eagles-Don Felder, nos Rock Stars à la (pré) retraite nous offrent une résurrection inattendue à l'occasion de la sortie de ce (double) album en octobre 2007. Mais prés de 2 ans après la sortie de ce disque attendu, une fois passé l'étonnement et la curiosité, que reste t'il  de cet album ? La réponse est : pas grand chose, les chansons passent et trépassent. On ne garde pas de souvenirs impérissables  de ces 2 rondelles, d'ailleurs les auteurs s'en sont-ils un peu rendu compte puisqu'ils ont aussi annoncé qu'il n'y aurait pas d'autre nouvel album du groupe dans le futur. Poutant l'album commence bien avec  ""no more walks in the wood"", un morceau a capella avec son enchainement de voix à nous coller la chair de poule. Le single ""how long"" (vieux titre écrit en 1972 par JD Souther !) tente de nous faire le coup de ""take it easy"" ou de ""already gone"", mais en beaucoup moins bien. ""Busy being fabulous"" est un bon morceau, signé Henley/Frey, comme à la grande époque, nappe d'orgue, refrain mémorable : du pain béni pour les radios US. Ensuite ça se gate avec les très mièvreux ""what do I do with my heart"",""I don't want to hear any more"" &amp; ""do something"", de la variété pur jus, ça continue avec les très ordinaires ""guilty of crime"" &amp; ""fast company"". Heureusement Don Henley se rattrape avec ""waiting in the weeds"" et l'album s'achève par ""you are not alone"" qui arrive à nous séduire avec ses élans folk et nous fait basculer 30 ans plus tôt, à la douce époque des intros de guitare en picking.   Le second CD commence plutôt bien, ""long road out of eden"" est certainement le meilleur titre de l'album : intro arabisante, solos de guitare inspirés et la voix magnifique de Don Henley qui se pose sur des arrangements grandioses. Les Eagles enchainent ensuite pêle-mêle un instrumental très Knoppflerien, un rock sympa ""somebody"", un morceau semblant sortir d'un best of de Santana ""last good time in town"", ""business as usual"" et ""frail grasp on the big picture"" ne sont pas très inspirés et  sont plombés par une longueur excessive et une lassitude quasi inévitable. Glenn Frey nous sort une petite ballade ""I love to watch a woman dance"", aux légers parfums irlandais, sympa mais pas inoubliable. le CD s'achève avec ""it's your world now"", pimenté à la (mauvaise) sauce mexicaine, le titre le plus faible de l'album qui sombre dans la variété de la pire espèce. Au final, cet album est un faux grand retour des Eagles, il aurait déjà gagné à être simple au lieu d'être double, et fait plus penser à une commande lucrative de leur maison de disques qu'à un besoin artistique de s'exprimer."
5,"lE RETOUR DES EAGLES ! Alors bien sur on peut dire qu'apres le depart tonitruant des 2 premiers titres, on tient la , un Eagles pur jus qui va faire mal ! Puis apres effectivement on dégouline peu à peu dans le sirop...Au début je me suis dit : Merde ! raté Puis finalement j'ai mis le 2eme album avec ses chansons hors format et j'ai adoré. Je l'ai écouté en boucle pendant 1 mois. Excellent. Je suis revenu peu à peu au premier et ce que je prenais pour du sucré manquant de guitares trempées dans l'acier, j'ai commencé à l'aprécier. Alors non ce n'est pas Desperado ni the long run C'est tout simplement un double album d'un groupe mythique en 2008 ! Et c'est déjà ENORME par rapport à la production merdique de R'nB, RAP et autres Techno inaudibles qui innondent nos bandes FM ! EAGLES est tout simplement GRAND"
2,"Les exigences de la promo font faire de drôles de trucs quand même. L'autre soir, à la fin de l'émission ""Ce soir ou jamais"" sur France 3, Vitalic devait jouer un morceau de cet album (le premier single ""Poison Lips""). Sur le plateau, il y avait aussi Laurent Garnier et David Guetta (Vitalic, Garnier, Guetta... Jeu : cherchez l'erreur), qui évoquaient leur métier de producteur/DJ et leur carrière respective. Garnier dû donc lâcher qu'il trouvait cet album ""brillant"". Alors qu'à mon avis il n'en pense pas un mot. Enfin, Garnier ou un autre d'ailleurs, car il semble évident que ce disque est une véritable ""plantade"". Ce son saturé et compressé est malheureusement devenu la norme, en France (label Ed Banger, Justice &amp; Co), mais aussi à l'étranger (Boys Noize, Digitalism...). Sans compter le côté électroclash, complètement cramé lui aussi depuis le temps. On ne saurait donc que trop conseiller au Dijonnais de quitter cette voie du ""rentre dedans"" pour aller explorer des contrées sonores plus personnelles (comme le font Garnier ou Joakim par exemple), sous peine de voir sombrer les derniers espoirs placés en lui."
1,"Evanescence. Ah, cet Evanescence. Une véritable révolution musicale pour certains, une vraie arnaque commerciale, ne devant même pas porter le nom de métal pour d'autres. Moi, pour ma part, j'entendais tout le monde me parler d'Evanescence. ""Va l'acheté, c'est du superbe gothique féminin"", ""Va l'acheter, les mélodies sont superbes"". Après tous ces conseils, je décidai donc d'aller l'acheter, et là...quelle déception!!"
5,"Cet excellent album est néanmoins l'un des moins bons de Jean-Michel Jarre. Contrairement aux autres, il n'y a pas d'unité et les morceaux ne s'enchaînent pas. De ce fait, il n'y a pas vraiment d'ambiance et l'ensemble est loin d'arriver à la hauteur d' ""Equinoxe"" (souvent considéré comme son meilleur album). En outre, beaucoup de ceux ayant vu le concert aux pyramides ont du être déçu par le morceau ""Bells"" qui n'a pas le relief qu'avait celui du concert et dans lequel il faisait merveille. Cela dit, il reste ce fait indiscutable que la beauté et la fusion des sonorités le placent une fois de plus dans le peloton de tête de la musique électronique."
1,"Inconditionnel d'Enya depuis ses débuts, là, j'avoue que je suis grandement déçu. Comme le dit Xophe 13, cet album n'apporte absolument rien. Aucune surprise, du vu et revu. Beaucoup d'ennui en écoutant ce CD. Enya est en perte de vitesse, à moins que cet album ne soit qu'un petit coup de pub pour s'acheter une voiture neuve. A ne pas acheter, c'est certainement son plus mauvais..."
2,"J'ai d'abord acheté Lunatico : un grand, grand CD. Adhésion totale. Puis La Revancha del Rango (qui était sorti avant). Déception. Plus techno, plus formaté FM, moins fin, moins musical, sacrifiant plus à l'air du temps. Un bon point pour Gotan Project : ils vont dans la bonne direction."
2,"J'ador Scarlett johannson et son timbre de voix mais, je dois bien avouer que j'ai été déçue par l'album !"
1,"En tant que fan de Tom Waits, je me suis infligé l'écoute de quelques morceaux de cet album et je dois dire que c'est un massacre. Tom Waits a été repris à de multiples reprises ( très rarement passables..) mais Scarlett Johansson devrait continuer le cinéma et arrêter tout de suite la musique ou reprendre des morceaux d'artistes moins géniaux."
2,"J'ador Scarlett johannson et son timbre de voix mais, je dois bien avouer que j'ai été déçue par l'album !"
2,"Si MJ ne voulait pas de cet album (il aurait préféré ne sortir que les chansons inédites), sa maison de disques a eu bien tort d'insister. Les remixes sont affreux! Pourquoi massacrer ""Earth Song"" qui l'une des plus belles réussites de Michael? Quant aux cinq chansons inédites, elles valent le coup. ""Blood On The Dance Floor"" et ""Ghosts"" sont des titres de premier ordre, tandis que les trois autres complètement de manière sympathique cet opus bancal."
2,"Je ne suis pas contre la musique de Michael Jackson, ni contre sa personne, mais Thriller est un disque d'une qualité variable. Alignant de magnifiques chansons tel que Thriller, Beat It et surtout Billie Jean, Michael Jackson nous offre la des perles n'ayant pas a rougir aux meilleures composition des Beatles. Mais nous avons d'un autre coté des compositions tres peu reluisantes tel que The girl is mine ou les deux dernière de l'album qui sont tout simplement mauvaise! Mais le pire de l'affaire ce ne sont pas les composition mais le terrible ""blanc"" qu'a provoqué cet album depuis pres de vingt-cinq ans! Le clip ""Thriller"" nous a offert MTV et l'abum par lui meme nous a offert une terrible industrie du disque qui ne se soucie maintenant que du chiffre d'affaire au detriment de la qualité de l'artiste ou d'un album. Thriller n'est pas un mauvais album, personne ne peut dire cela, mais son matraquage et son immense chiffre d'affaire va marquer un net coup d'arret pour la musique, que ce soit le rock ou la soul music...il y a un avant et un apres Thriller. Ecoutez le donc parce que vous aimez Michael Jackson ou parce que vous etes curieux, mais pas parce que il s'est vendu a trente-cinq millions d'exemplaires! Bye"
5,QUEL BONHEUR POUR UN VIEUX SHNOCK DE 55 BALAIS DE S ECLATER AU PACHA ET DE RETROUVER LA PLUSPART DES MORCEAUX SUR CET ALBUM
5,"Si vous appréciez le rnb et l'electro, le dernier album des Black Eyed Peas est à écouter. La créativité vocale des différents membres du groupe est particulièrement travaillée sur cet album. Les rythmes endiablés s'enchainent laissant alternativemant Will.i.am et Fergie se répondre comme un couple amoureux par solo vocaux. Beaucoup de bruit s'est fait autour du morceau Boom Boom Pow mais l'album en entier recèle de morceaux pouvant devenir de véritables tubes. Pour n'en citer que quelques-un (et le choix est difficile...) Amoureux : Meet Me Halfway, I Gotta Feeling, Alive,  Dansant : Rock That Body, Imma Be, Electric City L'album de l'été 2009 sans aucun doute si ce n'est l'album de l'année 2009."
5,EMINEM est de retour apres presque 5 ans d'absence du a des probleme autant familiale que personelle . . . Mes franchement sans le vouloir il faudrais qu'il face sa plus souvent !! Pour les fan d'eminem et donc pour moi se CD na que des TUBE .... AU TOPE EMINEM APRES 5 ANS AU TOP DU TOP MEME !!!
4,"Etonnant, tout un album de bossa novas. Soit des titres  tels que ""the boy from Ipanema"", soit des titres ""bossa novaisés"" : ""too marvellous for words"" ou ""walk on by"" nous sommes dans un monde brésilien.  Avec Wilson, Clayton et Hamilton plus Paulinho da Costa aux percussions la belle Diana nous livre un album d'une douceur tropicale qui, par moments, est prète à nous fermer les yeux pour une sieste méritée.  Sa voix de velours et son savoir faire nous maintiennent éveillés pour le plaisir de l'entendre. A écouter au soleil, dans une ambiance tropicale."
2,"C'est doux, mélodieux, les musiciens jouent sans fausses notes, la belle chante sans conviction Où est passé la musique, je ne sais pas Mais en tout cas ce n'est pas un disque de Jazz, tout au plus un CD de variétés idéal comme musique de fond à écouter pour s'endormir sans réveiller les voisins Bien décevant ce que le mercantilisme peut faire à une artiste qui avait tant de talent Snif"
1,"je vien d'écouter ""under the bridge"" des all saints"", reprise massacrée des red hot, ca devrai etre interdit de reprendre un des + belles chanson des red hot et d'en faire une telle... je cherche mes mots... horreur."
4,"Superbes melodies qui vous entraine des les premieres notes , textes simples et efficaces Bravo!"
5,"J'adore cette album, je l'ai depuis un moment et je ne me suis jamais lassée de l'écouter! Des musiques entrainantes pour dire des choses dures et graves, une voix envoûtante, un mélancolie à fleur de peau...  Une très bonne combinaison pour cet album inoubliable de De Palmas."
2,"Oui évidemment c'est bien fait c'est charmant et il y a toutes les notes. On sent que tout le monde joue très bien de son instrument, très bien vraiment. Mais plus personne ne prend du risque. Un grand art de la berceuse idéal pour les amnésiques."
1,"...l'étendard rock ...à ses derniers temps une mauvaise tendance à etre porté par des groupes qui ne veulent qu'etre des ""rock star"" à l'americaine ...genre nickelback justement mais aussi likin'park ou les mièvres Staind ...Ceux qui croient que la qualité va de pair avec le nombre d'album vendu se bourre le doigt dans l'oeil et se revele etre passablement naif... En écoutant nickelback j'ai la réel sensation d'écouté une collision musicale entre nirvana et metallica...mais en ne prenant finalement que les clichés rock 'n roll de ses 2 groupes , sans en extraire l'essance meme...c'est finallement un autre groupe supplémentaire qui vent ses albums comme des petits pains à un jeune public americain(et mondial mondieux!) qui est carrément anesthésié par la vision quotidienne de MTV... "" How you remind me"" est l'exemple typique de rock FM  fait pour marcher avant tout, et ensuite pour etre belle ensuite (un vrai artiste ne devrait avoir aucun critere commerciale qui influence sa 'zic) en fait nickelback se revele bien plus proche de Bryan Adams , Bee Gees (periode disco), dire straits etc...bien plus proche dans son approche commerciale de la musique...(evidemment leur style musicale n'a rien a voir avec les groupes pré-cités)... ...Dur d'affirmer quelque chose comme ca ...mais je crains que si Cobain était encore vivant ...la decouverte macabre d'un groupe comme Nickelback qui se serait influencé par Nirvana l'aurait probablement emmené  a l'acte irréparable qu'il effectua en finallement en avril 1994... Je ne suis pas fan de nu-metal(nickelback n'est en fait ps du nu-metal)mais je trouve que il y a de plus en plus de daube et decheterie commerciale dans ce mouvement il n'y a guère que Deftones, Slipknot ou Korn (je ne suis pas fan nan plus mais...)qui merite toutefois d'etre respecté pour la sincerité de leur musique(le fric n'a rien a faire dans le rock) et leur qualité(reconnu par les critiques musicales spécialisés)... apparement ses valeurs ne se retrouve definitevement pas chez Nickelback ..."
1,"Rien dire, sauf que cette chanteuse n'a rien apporter à chanson française, même A.Souchon avoue de ""n'avoir pas trouvé l'inspiration pour d'écrire pour Sheila"", on  comprend pourquoi! rien d'intéressant dans sa voix, dans sa façon d'être sur scène, bref, écouter Shiela, c'est gnangnan... la meilleure chose qu'elle faite dans vie ""d'artiste"", c'est de quitter la chanson en 1989, et la plus mauvaise: c'est d'y revenir  Alors pourquoi avoir sorti ce cd? ps: cité moi s'il vous plait un seul ""single"" sorti entre 2000 et 2008"
2,"Chanteur d'un seul tube et arrivant cependant à faire des albums, on peut douter du bonhomme. Il a trouvé son style, genre bad boy qui fascine les filles. Cela étant, ça reste un simple chanteur de variété...."
1,"eh oui déçu par cet ouvrage. Je n'aime que le 4è titre. C'est un album bâclé qui n'ouvre aucune perspective. Le travail est correct mais U2 a tellement habitué ses fans à mieux qu'on ne peut vraiment pas adhérer à ce disque ou alors juste pour se dire qu'on écoute le dernier U2 et que ça ne peut qu'être bien car ils devraient être une valeur sûre. Après tout ils n'ont plus rien à prouver, le meilleur est définitivement derrière eux. Un groupe peut-il rester doué toute la vie ?  Changez d'horizon, essayez les montagnes !"
2,Décevant par rapport aux commentaires des internautes. J'en attendais plus mais je le trouve assez soporifique et monotone.
1,"En voila un qui mise uniquement sur la provoc' pure et dure pour en faire son ""fond de commerce"" et se faire de la pub .. Pour moi aucun intêret car insulter les femmes n'a rien d'artistique, c'est plutot PITOYABLE ... Mais bon tant qu'il y aura des ados un peu ""bas de plafond"" en crise d'identité et en manque de pseudo idoles soit disant ""rebelles"" à qui s'identifier, on aura toujours ce genre d'opportuniste ...

1,"Oui, HONTE à celui qui peut ecrire de telles insanités, HONTE à ceux qui les produisent , Honte à ceux qui les diffusent! -Saint Valentin: ""j'te teje et le lend'main j'te r'baise/je suis là pour te mettre 21cm/ tu seras ma petite chienne/suce ma b*** pour la Saint -Valentin"" -Sale pute :""j'veux q'tu creves lentement, qu'tu tombes enceinte et qu'tu perdes l'enfant/on verra comment tu suces quand je t'deboiterai la machoire (!!)/j'te f'rai tourner dans ma villa romaine"" Alors je le dis de suite ,qu'on ne vienne pas me dire que je sors des paroles de leurs contextes, qu'il y a second dégres là dedans , que c'est une licence poétique et que je n'ai rien comprit où je sors vraiment de mes gonds .C'est déjà fait d'ailleurs, et c'est d'une colére froide que j'ecris cette chronique .  Aurelien , tu te crois où, au Moyen age? Aprés tu appelles à quoi , à la lapidation? A couper les mains de la femme adultere? A là   ? Es tu conscient de ton irresponsabilité? Crois tu que dans les quartiers où on écoute tes trucs, il y ait besoin que l'on jette de l'huile sur le feu, alors que les filles n'y ont jamais été aussi devaluées?Et quant toi tu te fais une autre fille tu frimes t'es un Don Juan, un tombeur; mais elles ce sont toutes des ""putes "", c'est bien ca ta mentalité? D'ailleurs il y en a marre de ces rappeurs machistes, les gars je vous rappelle qu'à la base le rap était une révolte contre l'oppresion, des noirs par les blancs dans les ghettos; et vous vous venez mettre la meme segregation envers les femmes (mais en meme temps faut pas toucher a vos meres et vos soeurs..)? Regardez ces clips désolants de ces rappeurs Us avec leurs grosses voitures, leurs grosses teubs et toutes ces filles lascives à leurs genoux.  Beeeuuurkk! Ces deux chansons ne figurent pas sur cet album, mais je ne peux que dire le dégout que m'inspire ce gars, et appeler au boycott de ce triste individu.. et qu'on ne vienne pas m'accuser d'etre un censeur. Aurelien Cotentin je te condamne à etre attaché à un piquet sur la scene ,sous les insultes et tomates pourries ,pendant tout un meeting des ""chiennes de garde"", peut etre cela te ferai t'il réfléchir, encore que pour cela il faut un cerveau.."
5,"Si Led Zep vous rebutte à priori (les concepts mystico-celtiques fumeux, les pochettes douteuses, le coté ""Spinal tap"", le hard viellot...), essayez cet album. C'est un des tous meilleurs albums de l'histoire du rock : une variété de style incroyable, cheque morceau est un hit, chaque orchestration est à tomber par terre, la voix de Plant n'est jamais mièvre, Kashmere est un morceau d'anthologie. Le plus curieux, c'est qu'au départ cet album était un recueil de fonds de tirroirs qui n'avaient pu trouver leur place sur les albums précédents... d'ailleurs la remastèrisation a fait du bien a certain morceaux un peu granuleux. Et au total c'est le chef d'oeuvre définitif de Led Zep. Tellement définitif qu'ils n'ont plus retrouve l'inspiration ensuite et qu'ils ont commence a tomber comme des mouches... Un chef d'oeuvre, intense. Un vrai plaisir a ecouter sur son balladeur, dans la foule."
2,Selon moi Presence est un des pires albums de Led Zep.Meme si il contient Achile Last Stand (qui est une bonne chanson) je trouve le reste de l'album assez ennuyant.Nobody's Fault But Mine pourrait etre une tres bonne chanson si elle ne saurait pas aussi répétitive.Et je trouve que Tea For One est un peu trop copier sur Since i've Been Loving you (Led Zeppelin III) Alors pour finir si vous ne connaissez pas Led Zep et que vous voulez vous achetez un album ne prenez surtout pas celui la!
5,John Mayall au sommet de son art et Mick Taylor égal (ou supérieur?) de Green et Clapton
5,"I grew up in the Woodstock era and was actually stationed in nearby West Point after my Viet Nam tour.  So this collection or documentary ""The Road to Woodstock"" directed by Bob Smeaton also holds a piece of me history.  I must say I almost did not watch this film as the front have was a packed with sound bites of people doing just what I did in the first paragraph of this review; they spent too much time telling how great they were and then some antidote about Jimi.  Hang in there you will be carried away. This is as close to live as you are going to get. Jimi is one of those performers that when let lose can perform rings around his formal recordings. Some times I think it is an acquired taste. I have to confess besides his adaptation of ""Starspangled Banner"" I was taken back more by ""Hey Joe"" written by Billy Roberts. Of course everyone has their favorites. No mater how you look/listen to it this production deserves a place in your collection."
2,"Meme pour un grand fan de Stevie Wonder, ce disque est décevant. C'est l'un de ses derniers albums (peut etre meme le dernier ?) sorti en 1981. Meme la présence du titre 'Free', reprise à tout va dans les publicités, ne sauve pas le niveau trres moyen de ce disque."
5,Ca fait meme pas 2jours que j'ai recu l'album que je l'ecoute en boucle ! ! ! cet album est genial ! ! !On ecoute des groupes inconnus en france. Je suis une grande fan des freres scott(one tree hill) et je recommande a tous les grands fan d'acheter cet album ! ! !
5,"Quel disque ! Quelle voix rauque mais mélodieuse ! Gros son soixante mais bien revisité. Mettez en boucle ""Mercy"" et ""Stepping stone"", fermez les yeux : vous êtes dans un club anglais (gallois)à l'ancienne, enfumé et bruyant, mais bercé d'une voix très moderne."
1,"Joy Division ?? Qui entend Joy Division là-dedans ? A part les roulements de toms au début de ""From the stars"", pompés sur ""Atmosphere"", la caisse claire de ""Heart and soul"" en intro de l'épouvantable ""Farewell to the fairground"", je ne vois pas. Oui, leur batteur a bien écouté Stephen Morris... Ici on est plutôt chez Human League, Danse Society, Duran Duran, peut-être... des groupes de deuxième zone, suiveurs de la new wave anglaise du début des 80's. Degré mélodique zéro (deux notes maximum pour les couplets, en aller/retour, Ian Curtis faisait ça aussi, mais c'était Ian Curtis), pas la moindre originalité instrumentale, production indigente, vulgarité FM. Au mieux, une pâle copie des injustement oubliés The Sound (""A place To Hide"", décalque laborieux du style inimitable d'Adrian Borland - comme il nous manque, celui-là), au pire, A-ha (souvenez-vous, l'atroce ""Take on me"", c'est la même voix) ou des chutes d'INXS.  Si vous aimez le genre new wave revival, allez plutôt chez Interpol, autrement inspirés, ou les honnêtes Editors (eux, au moins, ont un très bon chanteur), ou bien ré-écoutez  ,  ... mais ici, circulez, y a rien à entendre. Pas l'ombre d'un frisson, l'amorce d'un semblant de singularité, d'intensité. Et les écoutes répétées n'y font rien. A éviter."
4,Je trouve que cet album est différent des précédents.Je n'ai jamais été particulièrement fan de Madonna mais elle a su allier dans ce nouvel album différents style de musique qui sont vraiment agréable à écouter!
5,"C'est un album qui ravira tous les amateurs de musique dance électronique : ""Hung up"" et ""Sorry"" sont sans conteste mes deux chansons préférées, devançant ""Isaac"" qui mériterait d'être davantage connue. Les morceaux sont entêtants, et donnent envie de bouger.  Bref, à posséder absolument."
1,"J'y arrive pas. Je serais une des rares personnes à ne trouver aucun talent à cette femme d'affaire dont je ne sais toujours pas pourquoi elle fait autant parler d'elle. C'est daté ""années 80"" dans ce qu'elles ont de plus pénible (du bon gros synthé, des boites à rythme sans aucune finesse et cette voix acidulée sans aucune nuance...) Mais bon, devant la Vox Populi, je m'incline et je reconnais que c'est ""cette chose"" aussi la musique....Le plus curieux avec la Madonne, c'est que toutes ses consoeurs que l'on accuse d'être les descendantes directe de son ""style unique et innimitable"" sont systématiquement plus douées qu'elle : Cyndi Lauper, Britney Spears, Gwen Stefani et autres Christina Aguilera. Comme si elles avaient transformé le mauvais gout de Madonna en talent réèl."
2,"J'ai été très étonnée de l'avis 100% favorable d'une grande partie d'internautes sur cet album qui me parait totalement loupé. A part 2 ou  3 titres qui me plaisent vraiment beaucoup (""Deeper &amp; Deeper"", ""Bad Girl"" et ""Rain""), le reste est en trop, c'est lourd et ne correspond pas du tout aux précédents albums qui eux, au moins, étaient géniaux. Cet album est un changement de style radical très décevant, et je dois dire que j'ai pris une grosse tarte quand je l'ai écouté, surtout quand on a entendu avant des chefs-d'oeuvre comme ""True Blue"" ou ""Like a Virgin"". Il est truffé d'allusions sexuelles plus ou moins marquées, franchement à quoi ça sert ??? Pourtant, j'ai essayé de l'écouter attentivement à maintes reprises mais c'est vraiment indigeste."
4,"Je comprends que les ""fans"" du groupe aient été désorientés par ce dernier CD, mais je le trouve vraiment très agréable à écouter, surtout quand on sait dans quelles conditions il a été élaboré... Alors que d'ordinaire je ""scanne"" les debuts des morceaux des CD que je viens d'acheter, ici, dès ""future proof"" (peut être la meilleure chanson du disque?) j'ai été ""happé"" par cette ambiance à la fois sombre, mystérieuse, crépusculaire, mais aussi tranquille, avec une certaine forme de maturité. Et avec Sinnead O'CONNOR, l'émotion est aussi au rendez vous (""a prayer for england"" par exemple). Il n'y a pas la ""pêche"" de MEZZANINE, certes, mais les morceaux s'enchainent bien, les sonorités synthétiques et les voix sont très belles, et à part le dernier quart du disque qui s'étiole un peu, je trouve ce CD bien abouti et l'écoute souvent. Mais attention : il requiert de la disponibilité et un minimum de qualité dans votre équipement sonore pour l'apprécier pleinement."
2,"Curieuse que cette période Evita dans le parcours de Madonna. Elle voulait jouer le rôle depuis une bonne dizaine d'années. Le résultat fut décevant par rapport à l'énergie et aux talents déployés. Le film était pompeux et académique, Alan Parker n'ayant fait preuve d'aucun point de vue, d'aucune lecture personnelle sur le sujet. Madonna, il est vrai, a bien tiré son épingle du jeu, mais il était triste de voir sa performance ruinée par une mise en scène paresseuse et ô trop combien pesante."
5,"Du lourd, du trés lourd ! Madonna ne fait pas dans la demi mesure (une fois encore). 14 ans après son retour à ses racines R&amp;B (""Bedtime Stories"" 1994), la Queen of Pop nous offre un album à la carure impressionante! Ce qui surprend d'emblée c'est la façon dont l'icone s'approprie tous les styles musicaux avec un incroyable naturel (là où d'autres artistes y dilueraient leur personnalité musicale). Un retour en force donc, n'en déplaise aux esprits chagrins dont certains n'hésitent pas à se prétendre ""anciens fans déçus"" pour mieux cautionner leur médisance gratuite (la seule lecture de tous leurs posts négatifs est révélatrice) ! Mais les faits sont là: un album brillant avec un premier single qui cartonne aux USA et à travers le monde (N°1 quasiment dans tous les pays !!!). Du jamais vu pour un(e) artiste qui fête cette année ses 25 ans de carrières couronnés par son intronisation au Rock &amp; Roll Hall of fame ! Longue vie à la Reine !!!!"
4,"Alors qu'on se le dise franchement : fan de Madonna depuis des années, on ne pourra effectivement pas dire que ce sera son meilleur album (qui reste selon moi pour le moment Ray of Light). Cependant, on ne pourra pas reprocher à la Madonne de s'enfermer dans un style qui pourrait lasser ! Elle aurait aussi bien pu se dire : Confessions a marché honorablement, on prend les mêmes composantes et on recommence. Et c'est cela qui est intéressant : c'est qu'à chaque fois, on redécouvre qqch de nouveau dans son répertoire. Rappelez-vous American Life : cet album ne ressemblait à aucune autre de ses réalisations, certes il est restait un peu en demi-teinte mais au moins, c'était nouveau. Et pour ce nouvel opus, c'est la même chose : on découvre la Madonne dans un nouveau registre : du R'n'B up-tempo ... Sur le concept, pourquoi pas ? Alors, on aime ou pas, après tous les goûts sont dans la nature.  Je pense qu'il me faudra plusieurs écoutes pour me faire à cette idée car c'est vrai qu'à la première écoute, j'ai eu du mal à accrocher. Mais finalement, c'est assez plaisant, une fois de plus ça donne envie de bouger. Ce qui me gêne un peu plus, c'est le style que Madonna s'est donné pour la promo de ce nouvel album. Elle, qu'on croyait être redevenue raisonnable, et ben c'est râté. Je pense qu'à un certain âge, il faut quand même savoir se mettre un peu sur la réserve. Surtout que le style beaucoup plus sage adopté depuis Ray of Light jusque American Life ne lui allait pas mal du tout.  A suivre ....."
2,"Je pense sincèrement que ce dixième album marquera la fin de la carrière de Madonna. Cette artiste à la voix douceureuse, pourtant à l'origine de succès planétaires, de ""Holiday"" en 1982 à ""Frozen"" en 1998, signe son propre arrêt de mort en composant, en compagnie du musicien et producteur franco-afghan Mirwais, des textes satiriques comme ""American Life"", une critique du style de vie nord-américain, et ""Hollywood"", une attaque adressée directement au siège de l'industrie du spectacle qui l'a rendue si riche et renommée."
2,"Autant le second album m'avait agréablement surpris, tant par son originalité, que par les accopagnements, autant celui-ci est mou, convenu, délivrant une musique propre, apsetisée, mais dépourvue de fougue, de flamme. Rien n'en ressort vraiment après deux écoutes. C'est sympa, c'est tout."
5,"Malgrè toutes les qualités et la virtuosité d’Eric Clapton, je n’accroche jamais à ses albums (fans absolus, veuillez m’excuser). Mais ici le charme du unplugged opère et c’est avec énormément de plaisir que j’ai découvert ce disque ! L’atmosphère y est très buesy et intimiste et je préfère nettement Eric Clapton avec une guitare acoustique. A ceux qui ne sont pas fan non plus, soyez curieux, ce unplugged est une grande réussite qui pourrait bien vous étonner !"
5,"Les hasards de la vie ont fait que j'étais resté près de trente ans sans réécouter ce chef d'oeuvre... Quelle vie gâchée!  Je crois qu'on s'enferme dans un débat un peu verbal quand on accole à ce titre l'étiquette de ""psychédélique"", compliment empoisonné le plus souvent. La ""soul music"" n'est pour les Floyd qu'un terreau, une base de départ. Planera qui voudra, moi ce CD me fait penser à Joyce, que je découvrais d'ailleurs à la même époque: même féroce nostalgie, même rage de l'expression, absence superbe et délibérée de tout ""message"", c'est le lyrisme à l'état pur, induit à partir des bruits les plus banals de la vie quotidienne et organisé autour de la recherche d'un sens qui se dérobe... Jamais les Floyd ne cèdent à la tentation de la virtuosité pour la virtuosité, ni à celle de l'emphase. Je crois qu'il faut prendre très au sérieux le titre, qui suggère la recherche d'une sorte de matrice originelle dont tous nos rêves et de tous nos fantasmes, ou du moins beaucoup d'entre eux, seraient issus. Confrontés au vertige de la régression, les Floyd s'en sortent brillamment, grâce à leur umpressionnante palette de moyens musicaux, leur capacité de distanciation et aussi cette pointe d'humour qui est comme leur marque de fabrique. Vraiment un sommet."
5,"Je fais souvent le même rêve bizarre et à chaque fois, je suis réveillé par le fracas des réveils et des pendules qui sonnent tous en même temps, et mon coeur bat si fort que je crois qu'il va exploser. Dans ce rêve, je me trouve isolé au milieu d'un désert de graviers noirs s'étendant à perte de vue, sous une voute céleste sans étoiles, un désert à peine éclairé par les lampadaires qui ne devraient pas se trouver là. Puis j'aperçois une vague lumière au loin, qui se révèle être celle de ma chambre; à la fenêtre, je me vois, hurlant à la lune, une lune sardonique, pâle comme la mort, et je me mets à courir dans la nuit... Dans la réalité, les réverbères me parlent souvent, et me racontent des histoires souvent très longues et très confuses. Des histoires qui sont sensées me faire redescendre sur terre, une terre que je vois aussi parfois dans mes expéditions immobiles, non pas bleue et lumineuse mais sombre, comme éteinte, morte... Heureusement, les drogues que l'on me donne atténuent les voix qui ricanent dans mon cerveau et rattrapent mon esprit quand il entame un grand saut en forme de long jet blanchâtre dans le vide intersidéral...  Les réverbères me ramènent aussi parfois, quand je m'éloigne un peu trop dans la plaine du Silence aux pylones-pyramides clignotant dans les ténèbres. De l'autre côté, c'est l'inconnu. Il paraît que c'est trop dangereux pour moi d'aller là-bas pour le moment, car il y aurait des gens... De toutes façons, je suis bien ici, en compagnie des lampadaires intelligents, dans cette nuit perpétuelle qui m'enveloppe et me rassure, sur cette face de la lune où je me suis réfugié depuis ce qui me semble être maintenant une éternité. Eclipse totale... I feel good, on the dark side of the moon..."
2,"Wings s'affaiblit et ce n'est pas london town qui prouvera le contraire. L'album est fade, brouillon, ça s'enchaine mal, bref à éviter, même le concept du disque (enregistré sur un bateau au large des iles caraibes) est mauvais. On sent que le voyage, n'est qu'un pretexte pour se concentrer sur une des activités favorites (de l'époque) du couple MCcartney, l'usage de cannabis à haute dose. Celà s'entend tout de suite et ce n'est pas les titres pourtant pas si mauvais comme ""london town"", ""with a little luck"", ""I'm Carrying"" qui sauveront l'album du nauffrage."
5,"Si Alice In Chains a toujours été un groupe entouré d'une sorte d'aura mystique, particulièrement depuis la mort le 20 Avril 2002 de son chanteur, Layne Staley, alors « Dirt » en est définitivement sa plus sublime représentation. Deux années auparavant, en 1990, le groupe sortait « Facelift », son premier véritable album, sur lequel il trouvait petit à petit sa voie en affichant clairement des influences metal le démarquant du reste de la scène dite « grunge » . Et puis il y avait cette voix... celle d'un homme semblant porter le poids du monde sur ses épaules, ces parties de guitares imbibées d'originalité et de noirceur, cette ambiance... Le fait est que deux années plus tard, le groupe allait décupler chacun de ces ingrédients et accoucher de ce qui allait devenir sa référence ; le bien nommé « Dirt ». Un album infecté, malade, sinueux et torturé, suintant le mal-être et la dépendance... un album qui n'en devenait alors que plus poignant à vivre. Alice In Chains portait là à son paroxysme tout ce qui les différenciait de la masse ; les guitares torturées de Cantrell, la voix accablée de Staley, l'harmonie de leurs deux voix, les textures basse/batterie, les textes poignants et criants de malaise que ce soit dans l'exorcisme des relations père/fils d'avec un vétéran du Vietnam pour Cantrell sur le sublime « Rooster » ou les digressions narcotiques au goût funéraire de Staley sur une bonne moitié du disque. Ce « Dirt » touchait le fond, un fond qui le hissait à des sommets de beauté. « Rooster », « Dirt », « Angry chair », « Down in a hole », « Would ? »,... impossible d'établir une liste des perles qu'il renferme tant elles sont nombreuses... à noter également l'apparition de Tom Araya de Slayer sur le délirant et complètement décalé « Iron gland ». A mon sens l'un des rares albums à ne pas usurper le titre d'indispensable."
1,"Encore pire que le précédent opus de ce tribute band. Seul peut-être High Hopes sort du lot, quoiqu'il en soit c'est une bien pâle imitation de Pink Floyd. Quel dommage que le Groupe ne se soit pas arrêté après The Final Cult laissant chacun à sa carrière solo respective. Ce n'était vraisemblablement pas suffisamment lucratif pour Mister Gilmour dont les albums solos sont navrants de platitude."
5,"Cet album est un pure joyaux, rarement un live n'a dégagé autant de puissance, de force... Malgré les années passées, il n'a pas pris de rides et de nombreux groupes actuels peuvent s'accrocher s'ils veulent rivaliser. Avec N. Young the rock never sleep........."
2,"Je me suis laissé tenté par une soi-disant version SACD HYBRID (qui passe sur tout lecteur CD - mais dont on ne constate la valeur que sur le matériel approprié) parce que je fus agréablement surpris par les rééditions SACD HYBRID de Dylan (même sur un lecteur normal, l'effet est superbe et saute aux oreilles). Mais cette réédition CD japonaise de 2002 utilise DSD (Direct Stream Digital) qui est soi-disant le même procédé de conversion que SACD (Super Audio CD). Et bien au niveau du son c'est une grosse déception, relativement à l'effet attendu. J'avais ce superbe album en K7 auparavant, et le son était dix fois meilleur, c'est vous dire. Peut-être que la version remastérisée de 2007 est meilleure (et deux fois plus chère, aussi), je n'en sais rien. En tout cas je déconseille celle-ci. On aimerait aussi que les commentateurs s'attardent sur ce genre de considération pour aider les futurs acheteurs dans leur choix. Je connais l'histoire de l'album, merci. Inutile de répéter ce que les magazines nous disent déjà."
4,"C'est vrai, aprés un chef d'oeuvre comme Ziggy Stardust, c'était dur de faire aussi bien. Mais Bowie et son groupe n'ont pas changé, ca reste dans la meme veine, en un peu plus dur. Ce qui manque le plus c'est l'étincelle de magie de Ziggy. A mon avis, ca vient de la démarche trés ouverte musicalement de l'artiste, qui en mélangeant un peu tout (Ballade, Rock, Punk, piano déjanté et pré-Disco ) fait perdre son homogéneité à l'oeuvre. La fin de l'album est en revanche une trés claire annonce de son virage vers les sons plus ""Disco"" de Young Américans.  En conclusion c'est quand meme un album à avoir ne serait ce que pour les quelques chef d'oeuvres comme ""Alladin Sane"" et ""Driving saturday"" etc.... (De plus en regardant les autres commentaires, je me dis qu'il y en a pour tous les goûts car chacun a des avis différents sur les chansons majeures de l'album !)"
5,"La longue et célèbre intro des guitaristes donnent le ton : Ce concert sera fichtrement bon ! Lou Reed est un ange noir et ce soir là il est en osmose parfaite avec ses musiciens. Dick Vagner et Steve Hunter sont particulièrement inspirés et se complètent à merveille, servis par une rythmique imperturbable. Les climats sonores s'enchaînent et le rock n' roll urbain de Lou Reed suinte de toute part, à l'image des quartiers glauque de New York que l'artiste semble bien connaître ! Je possède cet enregistrement en version vinyle, en cassette et depuis peu sur Cd, c'est dire ! Bref, ce disque est réellement remarquable. A noter également que le pourtant moins célèbre ""Live"", même époque et même groupe, est de la même trempe..."
1,"""Dark Horse"" n'est pas un bon album. Si vous avez vibré devant le chef-d'oeuvre qu'est ""All things must pass"" vous aurez du mal à croire que c'est le même homme qui a composé ""Dark Horse"".  Pour être plus précis, on peut dire que les deux seuls morceaux dignes d'intérêts sont l'instrumental ""Hari's on tour"" qui ouvre l'album, et la ballade ""It is he (Jai sri Krishna)"" qui le termine. Le reste est tout-à-fait plat. Le pire est peu être l'interprétation de George Harrison sur ce disque : il chante avec un voix sèche, écorchée : clairement, on à l'impression qu'il a enregistré alors qu'il souffrait d'un beau mal de gorge. Vous comprendrez que ce n'est pas franchement agréable à entendre... Passons donc sur cette oeuvre médiocre de la carrière d'Harrison; après tout, c'est le lot de tout artiste - même le plus grand - que de connaître un jour l'échec."
2,"Cette compilation bénéficie d'une bonne idée : la présence de trois titres des Beatles joués pour le Bangla Desh Concert. En dehors de ça, on retrouve quelques titres incontournables, mais trop de morceaux historiques ou indispensables sont manquants !! où sont passés ""Bangla Desh"", ""Dark Horse"", ""You"", ""Beware of Darkness"", ""Sue me Sue You Blues"", ""Not Guilty"", ""This Guitar"", ""Crackerbox Palace"", ""Awaiting On You All""?  Tous ces joyaux seraient-ils en réserve pour un volume 2?"
2,Il est grand temps que les annees 80' s'arretent. mauvais millesimes pour Paul Mccartney.
2,"En fan de glam, j'ai été très surpris par ce disque de ""plastic soul"". Si ce disque fut le premier disque de blanc a entrer dans les hit-parades noir, il n'a pas su me seduire. Mais bon, sans doute je m'attendais à trop de ce disque... Ce qui est certain, c'est qu'il rompt totalement avec les précédants albums que j'adore pourtant!!!"
5,"Cet album est un des incontournables d'Elton John car il prophétise (presque)tout ce que celui-ci a fait de meilleur : toute la première carrière d'Elton est là. The Cage et Bad Side of the Moon annoncent les grands moments rock (Saturday Nigh's alight for Fighting, The Bitch is Back, etc.), No Shoes String on Louise annonce le côté country d'albums comme Tumbleweed Connection ou Honky Château, des titres commes The Greatest Discovery ou Sixty Years On annoncent les chef-d'oeuvres d'orchestration (Tiny Dancer, Levon, etc.), The King Must Die annonce la grandiloquence de Have Mercy on the Criminal, etc. Elton John est donc un album émouvant pour tout amateur du maître des années 70, et indispensable pour tout amateur de rock orchestré. En outre, il contient Your Song : le mythe. Rien ne vaut d'écouter la version originale de ce tube.  Un sommet à ne pas manquer."
5,"Nous sommes en 1967... tu peux imaginer ça toi, aujourd'hui... 1967... Ce disque... le disque ultime, le seul, l'unique. Quatre génies créateurs comme le rock n'en a jamais produit d'autres. Non je ne parle pas d'obladi-oblada. Le Velvet parle de nos terreurs, parle à nos terreurs. Deux guitares rouillées qui grincent des dents, un violon qui nous vrille le cerveau, une batterie qui n'en est pas une. La douleur, le mal, nos perversions, nos désirs, nos angoisses, nos névroses sans espoirs. Le velvet est tout ça à la fois. Ce disque faisait peur, il fait toujours peur. Quels parents ont envie que leur fille écoute une chanson qui s'appelle Heroin... même 34 ans après : ""When I put a spike into my vein And I'll tell ya,  things aren't quite the same  When I'm rushing on my run And I feel just like Jesus' son"". Quels parents ont envie que leur fille s'initie aux ""Shiny, Shiny Boots Of Leather""?  Ce disque a paraît-il suscité tant de vocations qu'il existe plus de groupes s'en réclamant qu'il ne s'en est vendu d'exemplaires à sa sortie.  Et puis il y a ""The Black Angel's Death Song"", et ""European Song"" et ses chaises rouillées qui grincent sur le béton froid de nos cauchemars. Et puis il y a ces cathédrales de cristal que sont les chansons chantées par Nico. Et puis... et puis... vous ne l'avez pas encore acheté?"
4,"Beck signe un album troublant, mélancolique qui risque de surprendre et faire fuir certains fans. On est loin des titres dansants, funkys, légers des précédents albums. Beck livre une partie de lui plus sombre. Les musiques apparaissent plus dépouillées, beaucoup de guitares acoustiques, des cordes et des batteries (fortement imprégné de sonorités 70's)qui évoquent le Virgin Suicide de Air . Beaucoup de références musicales dans cet album: une magnifique relecture de l'album Melody Nelson de Gainsbourg (Paper Tiger),des chansons qui évoquent Nick Drake, John Cale... Cet album en déroutera certains mais va surement conquérir de nouveaux auditeurs plus attirés par le songwriting dépressif !!! A vous de vous faire une idée mais j'espère une bonne idée !"
1,"Aujourd'hui, on buzz pour tout et surtout n'importe quoi...Faites quelques unes et quelques articles laudateurs, et les ventes suivront, peu importe le contenu.    MGMT en est un exemple éclatant: sur leur album, ils n'y a que deux vraies chansons, ""Time to pretend"", le single qui fait illusion, et ""Kids"". Problème: cette dernière aurait pu être excellente si elle n'avait pas été délayée sur 5 minutes de façon complètement inutile.    Pour le reste, c'est le règne du n'importe quoi. Les titres sont invertébrés, plutôt lents pour la plupart et les garçons abusent d'effets sonores en tout genre. L'écoute laisse l'impression qu'ils n'ont retenu du psychédélisme que la défonce. Du coup, l'auditeur devient assez vite somnolent.    Evidemment, les pauvres n'y sont pour rien dans le tourbillon médiatique que l'on crée autour d'eux. Les journalistes, qui renvoient trop vite à Syd Barrett, devraient se rappeler que ce dernier, déja barré, savait écrire lui.    Don't believe the hype."
1,"Le groupe Hype du moment devant lequel tout le monde se prosterne. Ils me font penser un peu à Beck. Vous vous rappelez de Beck ? le mec qui devait changer l'avenir de la musique pop ! Il est où , hein maintenant Beck ?  Là c'est un peu la même démarche: ouahh et si j'appuie sur ce bouton , ça fait quoi ? Yeah Dude ! très Syd Barrett ! Et sur celui-là ? Whaouu trop King Crimson!!  Au final une voix plus que banale à la Supergrass qui passe son temps à vouloir imiter le Bowie d'Hunky Dory :  Le fameux premier single ""révolutionnaire"" évoque Blur époque girls and boys . Le son est sans réelle épaisseur .  Quant à la pochette ..... Brice de Nice version purple rain....  La deuxième chanson emprunte sans vergogne au Melody Nelson de Gainsbourg et tente un refrain façon kinks .  Le troisième est un horrible morceau disco ( on avait déjà Franz Ferdinand , merci du cadeau .....) .  Les trois derniers morceaux sont complètement imbuvables (normal c'est du sel de mer...ah ah ....).  Pour un duo vraiment original , prière de s'orienter vers The Kills et pour les expérimentations sonores on est vraiment très loin de ce que font Christophe et Trent Reznor en studio.  Ps :faîtes un petit tour sur Youtube, vous verrez sur N'IMPORTE QUELLE VIDEO que le groupe n'assure pas une cacahouete en live et semble même s'ennuyer ferme sur sa propre musique!! Si ces deux jobards sont censés incarner le futur de la pop , NO FUTURE !!"
4,"Avec cet album, Oasis essaye de renouer avec le succès des deux albums Morning Glory et Definitely Maybe. Malgré 2 ou 3 chansons plutôt moyennes pour un groupe de ce niveau, l'album est bon, voire excellent. L'album est toutefois court (10 chansons) mais Noel Gallagher a toujours une inspiration étonnante et Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants restera comme un des 3 meilleurs albums sortis en 2000."
2,"On attendait peut-être trop de la part d'Oasis. Le très grand groupe de rock qui a composé Definitly Maybe et Morning Glory n'est plus que l'ombre de lui-même. Restent deux ou trois morceaux potables pour entretenir quelques fans, mais cet album est presque plus insipide que le précédent. Un réveil s'impose..."
4,"Ce best-of a été l'occasion de rappeler au public que les années 90 ont connu un groupe équivalent au grands groupes des années 60 et 70 et que le rock n'est pas mort bien qu'il ai perdu un véritable génie ( sur qu'il aurait detesté ce que je dis )en la personne de kurt cobain. Cependant, il manque dans ce best of les morceaux qui rendent la musique de NIRVANA tant rageuse et belle, comme negative creep, aneurysm, school, scentless apprentice..."
5,"Le dernier disque de My Bloody Valentine, un des premier groupe à expérimenter l'utilisation du sampling et du vibrato des Jaguars et autres Jazzmasters comme un instrument à part entière, ajoute le flou à ses morceaux dans une mélancolie profonde et touchante."
5,"Si vous aimez Bob Dylan, il vous faut ce cd. Si aimez les chansons fleuve de 10 ou 15 minutes parlant d'une fille aux yeux tristes des Lowlands, il vous alors carrément ce cd. Bref, un bon cd."
5,"George Martin dit qu'Abbey road est son album préféré...Difficile d'être plus royaliste que l'arrangeur des Beatles ! Une suggestion : écoutez bien le tout dernier titre Her Majesty, c'est nettement plus subtile et plus drôle que la charge des Sex Pistol. Les fab four avaient mis la barre très très haut en tirant leur révérence :-)"
5,"A tout prendre, autant ce Let It bi là que le Naked de Paulo. Pourtant, je me souviens de ma déception lors de l'achat de Let it Be, (faut dire que derrière le champagnissime Abbey road ça faisait tout bizarre) d'autant qu'il coutait bonbon dans son emballage de luxe cartonné, son livret avec plein de photos des séances d'enregistrement. Les arrangements sont ce qu'ils sont, et malgré les ""tambours et trompettes"" de Phil Spector, qui soit disant alourdissent l'ensemble, je le préfère ainsi que dans la nudité du Naked (ta mère). De plus on entend des bribes de conversations, des morceaux certes inachevés, mais le tout donne du ludique à un CD dont l'enregistrement ne fût pas toujours des plus joyeux. Alors ""parlez moi du Naked et je vous vous mon poing sur la gueule, sauf le respect que je vous dois"". Avec le recul, ce CD est encore une fois sublime (je sais, je ne suis pas objectif, pourtant je pèse mes maux... mouais) car les mélodies, comme d'habitude sont d'une force irrésistible (là je suis sérieux). Pour les partisans du ""Naked"" , à ce compte là autant aller jusqu'au bout du dénuement et enlever tous les instruments pour ne laisser que les voix. Ainsi, chacun pourra refaire ce disque à son goût et on en aura fini de Paul et Mickey sur Let it Be. Allez, zou, 5 étoiles à let it be qui le mérite bien. Par contre, je n'ai encore jamais écouté un remasterisé... parait que c'est chouette."
5,"Les beatles avaient frappes tres fort avec ce sublime album en 1969 malgre les tensions dans le groupe,peut etre leur meilleur album (il y a quand meme"" revolver"" ou  le ""white album ""),moins d'ambiances differentes et d'experiences solos que sur le ""white album"",cela n'empeche que lennon suite a son accident en ecosse le 1er juillet ne participe pas a certaines sessions (golden slumber,carry that weight et la base rhythmique de here comes the sun)et se detache pour le travail de collage sur la 2eme face d'ou un travail de groupe tout de meme mitige. Mais il y a tout de meme des moments grandioses ou l'etincelle beatles fait mouche comme sur ""i want you""ou chaque membre fait une prestation magnifique,ou encore ""come together"" un rock tres inspire et la ballade ""something""de toute beaute par un harrison touche par la grace,il ne faut pas oublier le titre de ringo ""octopus's garden""ou le groupe est tres soude pour une des meilleures chansons du batteur et la prestation vocale infernale de mac cartney sur ""oh darling"". Sur la 2eme face(d'origine bien sur)encore un harrison au sommet avec ""here comes the sun""avec la superbe partie de batterie de ringo,""because""de lennon magnifique puis l'immense medley final concocte par mc cartney et george martin dont ""golden slumbers"" et ""the end"" pour finir en apotheose.du grand art par un groupe de genie.pascal49"
1,"Encore une remasterisation victime de la ""loudness war"" : trop fort, trop de compression de dynamique. Cela donne un son sans relief, fatiguant et criard. Préférez les versions CD des années 80, plus respectueuses du son d'origine."
5,"la perfection, la legende, les tramps au somment de leur forme!"
5,"En perspective, Massive Attack est un bon groupe qui a apporté du renouveau dans la musique. Leur créativité est incroyable et cela se voit à la qualité de leurs morceaux. Les perles de ce disque à ne pas manquer sont les titres Angel repris dans une publicité de parfum, Tear Drop où s'élève une voix envoûtante qui vous transportera durant toute la longueur du morceau accompagné par des accords de piano à la fois simple et agréable et enfin le titre Dissolved Girl à ne pas louper car elle est sans doute la meilleure musique de l'album qui a notamment été empruntée à l'occasion pour le film Matrix. Si les réalisateurs et les publicitaires s'intéressent à la musique et au style du groupe Massive Attack, cela ne pourra que confirmer leurs multiples talents."
5,"Si le mot extraordinaire a été inventé c'était sûrement pour qualifié DUMMY. Pour sortir hors des sentiers battus, veuillez emprunter ces 10 chansons qui n'ont pas d'égales. Surtout ne vous arrêtez pas à la première écoute, apprivoisez-le et il vous donnera en échange sa force et sa magie! ...et proccurez-vous les deux autres albums!!!"
5,"legers, incisifs, sensibles et profonds, ses textes sont un véritable régale. Si vous aimez la musique et la poésie plutôt que le bruit et les mièvreries, vous ne serez pas déçu. Thomas fersen semble avoir la forte personnalité des grands solitaires qui se soucient peu des modes, il affiche son style, c'est un surdoué."
5,"De cet album émane fraîcheur,gaité,autant dans les paroles toujours très bien trouvées,que dans les acompagnements,qui vont vous fixer ces chansons là dans la tête pour longtemps. Cet album dépeint des tranches de vies et chacun s'y retrouve! on se surprend à le repasser en boucle. Vraiment une excellente découverte!!"
2,"Le 5 août 2007, Camille s'est ""exprimé"" à l'Abbaye de Bonmont en Suisse en chantant ""God is Sound - Prières du Monde"". Bien que le billet avoisinait le 33 euros, une masse importante de gens s'est déplacée pour entendre je que j'appelerai de l'esbroufe musicale. Incompréhensible au sens du texte, gesticulation surfaite, en d'autres termes une originalité qui, à force de minimalisme musical, ne devient plus Rien. Encore une particularité française bien étrange."
1,"Les deux premiers albums d'archive étaient excellents, londinium et take my head. Si londinium reste l'un des plus grands albums de trip hop de tous les temps, take my head fut complètement différent(du à la reconstruction totale du groupe) et nous offrait du pop-rock léger et harmonieux. Cet avant dernier opus est plus que décevant! Mise à part le premier morceau, on tombe dans un certain ennui tout au long de l'écoute, ce que c'est lent mon dieu! Un manque de peche!"
1,Je ne me ferais plus avoir par ces chanteurs qui sont bien sur le papier (comme interprète) mais qui se plantent lamentablement dans leur choix de chansons. A chaque fois ça nous coûte une blinde parce qu'on a cru à cause du single que le reste serait bien.  Je vous déconseille cet album.
2,"Je pensais que ce second album, aux sonorités plus électro que variétés, me plairait plus que le premier, que j'avais pourtant trouvé assez réussi. Quelle déception!  D'abord, ça commence mal avec cette pochette grotesque et hideuse. Le contenu ne remonte pas cette première impression. Le single phare de l'album, ""Berlin"" est un morceau vaguement électro composé sans le moindre talent. Les chansons de Zazie frôlent le ridicule, il ferait mieux d'aller voir ailleurs. ""Heartbox"" n'est pas mal fait, mais on touche là aux limites de Willem: il a tout pour être la vedette pop qui manque à la France, mais ne peut exprimer véritablement son potentiel que sur des chansons anglo-saxonnes. Or, il faut mettre une majorité de chansons françaises pour plaire à ses fans... De plus, l'électro-pop actuelle est de piètre qualité, et cet album ne fait pas exception. A ne pas choisir entre la variété française et le style anglo-saxon où sa voix est complètement noyée dans un brouhaha d'instruments pas très avenant, il risque de finir par lasser tout le monde. Bref, j'attendais mieux de la part de ce chanteur que cet album électro qui ravira certainement les fans de Britney Spears et de Rihanna mais ne peut satisfaire des oreilles à la recherche de sonorités pop de qualité."
2,Une musique très travaillée mais les mélodies et surtout la qualité des textes sont en retrait par rapport au premier album.
2,"Certes beaucoup de comptines et le CD n'est pas cher ! Bien pour les parents, grands-parents éducateurs pour les chanter aux enfants avec leur propre voix avec l'aide du livret bien fait. Je trouve ce CD stressant, musique très rapide dès le première "" tourne petit moulin"" si joliment chanté par d'autres comme les petits poissons et bien d'autres. Quant à l'accompagnement il y a nettement mieux ( voir Enfance et musique). Maman de famille nombreuse, enseignante et grand-mère, je suis déçue, mais ce n'est pas moi qui l'ai choisi. C'est beaucoup trop de comptines sur un même CD. Pas à faire écouter à un jeune enfant, il n'a pas le temps de respirer entre chaque comptine, juste pour les adultes."
1,"Après l'album studio ""Mon Paradis"", voici l'album live ""Comme à la maison"" qui reprend peu ou prou les mêmes titres devenus des ""tubes"" par la mattraquage quotidien auxquels nous sommes soumis depuis des mois : le public qui a toujours tort dans ses choix et raison quand il ingurgite la daube et en redemande est rassasié. 1. Est-il permis d'entendre pire en ce moment? Les ""textes"" (sic) sont d'une platitude rarement atteinte, la voix de crécelle stridente? On nage en plein outrage musical. 2. Se comporter à 33 ans (le beau Christophe a encore de beaux restes excepté la voix et l'accompagnement instrumental) comme un chanteur à minettes est affligeant. La faute à qui? Au pseudo-chanteur Christophe Martichon? Aux adolescentes boutonneuses qui l'écoutent à longueur de journée? À Warner qui fait d'une nullité une vedette (avec tout de même la bagatelle de 500 000 albums vendus)? On en vient à regretter la Star Academy, l'une des deux grandes fabriques de daube : ses artistes (sic) sont difficilement supportés mais finalement éjectés puis heureusement oubliés."
1,"On nous annonce déjà à l'avance que ce sera le tube de l'été !.. Mais qu'ont les médias pour déjà les encenser ? Je pense qu'ils reçoivent tellement de disques qu'ils lisent une fiche de plan marcketing sans écouter!  Les membres du groupe ont déclaré récemment qu'il ne se prenaient pas au sérieux et on comprend pourquoi... Ces trois Nantais chantent en anglais et en plus mal, la voix aigue du titre 3 est catastrophique. Les synthés sont nullissimes, retro mais dans le mauvais sens du terme (on dirait parfois le son des vieux titres des pays de l'Est) ! On se demande même si c'est pas encore ce modèle   L'Ouest nous envoie donc après ces artistes géniaux  ,  ,  , des mecs qui se la jouent déjà international. Ca commence par du sous-ELO (Electric Light Orchestra)   , puis ça devient pire dans un anglais approximatif très marquant dans le 4ème titre. En plus de l'orgue Bontempi, ils auraient pu nous épargner le Vocoder dans la chanson 5.  Bref, l'ensemble fait très amateur... BONTEMPI ? Oui, bon tant pis... Dommage car pendant des mesures très courtes de quelques dizaines de secondes, on trouve une bonne base, mais je pense qu'ils doivent encore sacrément bosser et changer de chanteur et arrêter d'essayer de chanter en anglais....   Attendons la prochaine marée bretonne..

4,"Voilà ce qu'on « pourrait » reprocher à cet album, la simplicité. Au contraire c'est un album sincère, honnête, qui s'écoute facilement. Un album qui parait simple pour les thèmes choisis, mais c'est oublier qu'Amel Bent, jeune femme, est toujours un peu enfant et ça contribue à son charme aussi !"

1,"J'ai commandé ce coffret de Parsifal le 25 avril. Il était proposé par ep_media_fr à 5,79 EUR. J' ai été débité de suite et 15 jours plus tard on m'a informé que l'article n'était pas disponible. Le remboursement a pris encore des jours de plus. Et maintenant je vois que le coffret est à 30 EUR! J'en conclus que la vente était une arnaque, que le coffret n'a jamais été disponible au prix indiqué, et que la société ep_media_fr se faisait ainsi de la trésorerie sur le dos des pauvres internautes mélomanes non avertis. J'ai demandé un dédomagement qui est naturellement resté sans réponse. Je ne comprends pas qu'un site sérieux comme Amazon ne sanctionne pas sévèrement ces abus et ne fasse rien pour ses cleints fidèles victimes de telles pratiques. bernard"
4,"Une oeuvre gigantesque, 23 morceaux, une grande et profonde histoire, celle du kid new-yorkais Rael qui cherche sa vérité, mais ceci nous concerne tous car chacun cherche sa vérité, n'est ce pas ? Comme un grand Opéra de Verdi ou Wagner, il y a une ligne ou un fil directeur, ou un leitmotiv, les arpèges tissés par les clavier de tony Banks et la continuité de l'histoire raconté par Peter Gabriel, et certainement j'en oublie. La musique est plus tourmentée, écrite comme un opéra, la musique est au service des mots, pourtant elle raconte à sa façon dans les instrumentaux. C'est pourquoi, il n'y a pas que des points forts, certains passages sont plus faibles que d'autres dû aussi, à cause la vitesse de création de l'album malgrés nombre de pressions extérieures, pression qu'on ressent très bien dans certains morceaux. On a quitté le pastorale de ""Selling"" bien qu'il contienne quelques titres dejà bien conflictuels et bouillonnant comme ""Battle of epping forest"". La cohésion musicale est toutefois grande, ce qui étais semble t'il beaucoups moins le cas concernant les relations entre les membres du groupe, Peter Gabriel qui préparait son envol. Ces jeunes on acquis le métier, et a quelle école! Genesis ! 6eme Album depuis ""The revelation"", que de chemin parcouru et quel transformation, la timide chrysalide est devenu papillon. Quelques part, c'est un peu l'histoire de peter, comme une métaphore qu'il raconte tout du long de l'album, quand il se trouve lui même à la fin du grand labyrinthe, il meurt d'une certaine façon et quitte tous ce qu'il a pu faire et créer avant, pour se fondre dans le tout. Partir pour être encore plus présent, dans le coeur de tous.  L'enregistrement de la musique est définitive, parfois c'est un moment de grâce dans le temps, mais nous,  nous changeons constamment, ce qui explique que notre oreille et notre esprit se modifie a chaque écoute, et ainsi notre avis peu différer ou changer avec le temps. En résumé, nous avons affaire à un chaudron d'imagination et de créativité, un Album qu'il faut parfois re-écouter pour redécouvrir et apprécier. Un Chef-d'oeuvre - presque parfait, préfigurant peut-être ""The Wall"" d'une certaine façon, mais qui malheureusement n'a pu s'offrir les même luxes de marketing. Ainsi que la dernière pierre essentielle de peter gabriel avant de quitter le groupe. Inoubliable, a découvrir ou a re-découvrir."
5,"du magma dans sa plus grande forme. Obscure, forte et gothique avant l'âge; et surtout un jeune violoniste pas encore reconnu (enregistrement de 1975) ""Didier Lockwood"" qui rivalisait dans la violence envôutante de son jeu, avec le phénomène Christian Vander. Pour ceux qui découvrent aujourd'hui ce groupe, un disque à avoir en priorité, de toute urgence"
5,"Pour moi, Roxy est sans doute le meilleur album de Zappa, c'est à dire 'un des meilleurs live et album de l'histoire. Chaque musicien est au sommet. Un disque bourré d'humour et d'improvisations géniales. INDISPENSABLE."
5,"Cet enregistrement des Noces ne réglera peut-être pas la question de la discographie car il ne comporte que les numéros musicaux, et encore : pas tous, mais... Karajan, tournant le dos au Mozart ""charmant"", déchaîne un déluge sonore (et pas seulement musical) inouï qui, avec au moins 30 ans d'avance (1950 !), coupe l'herbe sous les pieds des baroqueux(*) tout en bénéficiant de la densité des timbres de l'orchestre moderne et de l'idiomatisme du Philharmonique de Vienne. C'est donc une version qui synthétise tous les aspects des Noces - tout en étant le contraire d'une version tiède ou d'un juste milieu ! Les chanteurs sont quant à eux quasiment tous insurpassés dans leurs rôles respectifs, et leur confrontation est en cohérence absolue avec la tornade orchestrale. Böhm (DG), Kleiber, Solti, Giulini ou encore Muti vous donneront des Noces plus INTEGRALES mais certainement pas plus COMPLETES. (*) En 2001, René Jacobs déclarait à Répertoire à propos des Noces : ""Ce sentiment de panique, de tempête, de point de non-retour, c'est cela que je vais reproduire. (...) L'on rend justice à la musique de Mozart en demandant à des voix contrastées, parfois jusqu'à la caricature, de se mettre à chanter ensemble. (...) Alors (...) sélève le chant unique et magique de Mozart(...)"". 51 ans plus tôt, Karajan l'avait compris et, lui, réussi."
1,"Rien d'original,l'oeuvre de Camille ressemble à une dissertationde Lycéen pompeux qui intègrerait le plus de références posssibles.Camille n'a ni le génie de Bjork,ni l'inventivité d'Imogen Heap ni la folie de Cocorosie.Tout ce qu'elle fait a déjà été fait et beaucoup mieux par d'autres.Julien Doré a eu l'intelligence par le titre de son album""ersatz""d'assumer ses influences,Camille préfère se prendre une artiste avant gardiste mais elle n'est qu'un serial copycat.Pour conclure ses albums sont ""pompeux""et ressorte plus du plagiat,un plagiat certes érudit mais plagiat quand même."
1,"Alors que l'on pouvait s'attendre à retrouver de nouvelles chansons à texte de cette interprètre française très doué, cet album est en tout point décevant. Décevant car la plupart des pistes sont seulement musicales accompagnées quelques fois par des bruits de bouche, des bruits ou d'autres bruits. Les rares pistes chantés, le sont dans un méli-mélo franco-anglais qui rendent leur écoute fatiguante. Bref, à part 2 piste qui sortent vraiment du lot, pour retrouver notre Camille national, il faudra attendre le prochain album"
5,"Quelle voix ! Quelle tenue, quelle régularité du son, quel souffle ! Quelle émotion ! Si vous n'avez pas la larme à l'oeil en écoutant le ""Cum dederit"" du Nisi Dominus, votre cas est désespéré ! Très belle prise de son."
5,"On sait, en France, depuis ses récitals au Palais Garnier et au Châtelet que Renée Fleming compose ses récitals avec soin et intelligence. C' est encore le cas ici. On peut la remercier de chanter ce répertoire en donnant au mot  sa valeur, comme à la musique sans tomber dans la préciosité si courante. Une seule réserve : ""Mandoline"", trop interprêtée au premier degré. Quant à sa voix est-il besoin d'en parler ?"
2,"Piégé par un embouteillage sur l'autoroute, Steven Wilson se laisse aller à quelques divagations socio-philosophiques. A la découverte d'une enseigne ""POLICE - INCIDENT"" signalant un accident de la route, il se révèle surpris par le décalage entre cet évènement si traumatisant, si dramatique, et cette désignation si froide, si détachée. Il perçoit alors une présence soudaine, comme si l'esprit d'une personne décédée dans l'accident était rentré dans son véhicule et s'était installé à coté de lui. Ce type d'expérience est favorisé par certains traits de personnalité tels que la suggestibilité ou l'excentricité, et se vit donc régulièrement dans la population des artistes. La visite de ce sympathique fantôme incite alors Steven Wilson à se pencher sur certains faits divers récents que les médias relatent avec la même distance, la même désaffection. Pris d'une sympathie massive et finalement malsaine pour les différentes victimes, il décide de leur rendre une sorte d'hommage en traitant ces évènements à sa manière. Ainsi nait le projet d'un album concept regroupant ces faits d'actualité et au sein duquel l'utilisation de la première personne participerait à un effort global d'humanisation. Cette ébauche aux parfums messianiques s'étoffe rapidement au gré de l'inspiration et de la mégalomanie débordante de son initiateur, deux phénomènes majorés depuis l'irruption du double album solitaire Insurgentes (2008). The Incident est donc lui aussi constitué de deux disques, le premier dévoilant ce fameux concept sous la forme d'une gigantesque chanson de 55 minutes, le second livrant quatre compositions supplémentaires enregistrées auparavant.  Si le Religionnaire ne cessera jamais d'anticiper un double album de façon très négative, son ami Steven peut lui rétorquer avoir fait d'une pierre deux coups, et éviter ainsi de sortir son nouvel effort puis un album court comme il l'a fait dernièrement. Sceptique, le Religionnaire l'est également quant à cet immense et unique titre découpé en quatorze mouvements. Il ne saurait être question d'une escroquerie, Steven Wilson demeurant un artiste authentique et sincère. Cependant, ce format symphonique adapté au rock conduit systématiquement à un manque de consistance. Certaines sections constituent en effet des préambules, interludes et autres épilogues, certes légitimes et judicieux, mais ne peuvent revendiquer la solidité ni le mérite du titre qu'ils mettent en valeur. Pris indépendamment, les échantillons les plus concrets, qui sont au nombre de sept, ne sont pas aussi accrocheurs que le Religionnaire les aurait souhaités. ""The Blind House"" délivre une mélodie récurrente, plutôt efficace voire tenace et délicieusement maussade comme Steven Wilson sait les concocter, mais il manque à ce titre une dimension réellement poignante. Les sonorités industrielles incorporées sur ""The Incident"" pourraient davantage envouter si elles ne survenaient pas de façon inopinée et discordante. Le titre précédent ""Drawing the Line"" et son insupportable refrain flirtent en effet davantage avec U2 qu'avec Nine Inch Nails, et ne sauraient préparer le terrain de façon adéquate. Légèrement plus musclés, ""Octane Twisted"" et ""Circle of Manias"" dégagent des riffs complexes, une musique moins planante et plus condensée, mais pas aussi palpitante et inoubliable que certains exercices du passé, notamment sur Deadwing et In Absentia. Si la pièce principale ""Time Flies"" se démarque aisément du reste du disque, elle le doit à son charisme floydien. Malheureusement, à vouloir trop s'inspirer d'Animals, de la guitare rythmique de ""Dogs"", du final apocalyptique de ""Sheep"", et des magnifiques soli gilmouriens, Porcupine Tree en perd totalement son authenticité. Ce long échantillon dépassant les dix minutes est également l'occasion pour Steven Wilson de se recentrer sur sa vie personnelle. Cet égocentrisme soudain ouvre une brèche malheureuse dans le déroulement du concept et laisse libre cours à quelques banalités dispensables (""je suis né en 67, l'année de Sgt Pepper [...] au bout d'un moment, on réalise que le temps passe"") qui feront certainement plus honneur à Dream Theater qu'à Roger Waters.  Considérée dans sa globalité, l'aeuvre est plutôt bien conçue et suscitera sans aucun doute l'admiration des mélomanes avides d'ouvrages rock bien achalandés. Si The Incident fait parfaitement illusion dans sa superficie, il peine à convaincre en profondeur par son manque de consistance. Sa ligne directrice conceptuelle, apparemment claire et cohérente, est malencontreusement brisée par une tendance à l'errance sur le plan musical. Pour couronner le tout, Steven Wilson décide finalement de flatter la frange la plus extrémiste de son public en plongeant ce thème dans l'obscurantisme : The Incident devient alors selon lui ""une chanson cyclique et légèrement surréaliste à propos de commencements et de fins, et du sentiment qu'après cela, les choses ne seront plus jamais les mêmes"". Voilà qui devrait plaire aux amateurs des Tales from Topographic Oceans. Enfin, le Religionnaire ne saurait conclure sans quelques considérations sur le second disque. Bien maigre consolation, celui-ci ne parvient malheureusement pas à réconforter l'auditeur déçu du premier. Ces quatre titres variés, fort agréables au demeurant, manquent cruellement de caractère et n'attirent tout simplement pas l'attention. Des écoutes répétées ne rehaussent en rien la valeur de ce double album aussi ambitieux que peu attrayant. Steven Wilson devrait veiller à ne pas trop s'éparpiller, à ne pas trop diluer son talent dans de nombreux projets qu'il semble mener tout droit vers l'insignifiance..."
1,"Je m'attendais à ce que cet album soit plus original que ttes les autres chansons de r'n'b. Très déçue. Les chansons se ressemblent incroyablement. On en écoute quelques unes pendant une semaine, mais on s'en lasse très très vite !"
4,"Avec ce nouvel album,le groupe explore une gamme de possibilitées impréssionnantes. Chaque morçeaux est un condensé de belles choses,des breaks mélodieux,des changements de rythmiques inattendus,l'alternance de graves et aigus,des tempos variés. Un album à posséder absolument..."
1,"C'est à cause de la prolifération industrielle de ce genre de productions appelées ""Arèneubi"", très éloignées du  , de la  , du   mais aussi du   et de l'  qu'on en arrive à ce que 51% d'un panel de téléspectateurs (de TF1 d'accord, mais quand même !) pensent que ""R&amp;B"" est l'abréviation de ""Rap &amp; Blues"" (oui, vous avez bien lu).... Il convient donc d'appeler les choses par leur véritable nom et dire que ce qu'on entend là n'est ni plus ni moins que de la variété sirupeuse avec vocaux vaguement soul et/ou rapés sur des rythmes dance, voire eurodance (c'est-à-dire la version dévoyée, commerciale et datée de la house, la techno et l'électro). Voila qui est fait."
1,"Quelle déception!  Cet album est totalement raté, il faut comprendre par là que ce n'est plus du ""madonna"" comme auparavant! C'est pourtant simple, 2 titres sont potables sur cet album: ""Miles away"" et ""dance 2night"", le reste c'est du r'n'b sans rythme, sans génie, bref qui n'a rien à voir avec son meilleur album: ""ray of light""! Comment a-t-elle osé pondre ceci? Aucun respect envers ses fans!"

2,"C'est certain qu'on a envie de crier quand on voit ce que l'industrie du disque à fait de ces gamins relativement doués. Oui on a envie de crier comme ces gosses quand ils doivent se regarder dans la glace. Pas mieux traiter que de ""vulgaires"" pop stars : habille-toi comme ça, coiffe-toi comme ça, chante ça ! Le pire c'est que les chansons ne sont même pas mauvaises. En tous cas de bonnes crises de rires dans quelques années pour le revival ""Tokio hotel"". Encore pire que Sigue Sigue Sputnik, c'est dire ! Ce qui est vraiment stupéfiant c'est tous ces requins qui traînent dans l'ombre depuis des années dans la catégorie ""rebelles"", ce sont les mêmes qui bossent pour Shania Twain par exemple, vous voyez un peu le niveau de révolte. Ces gens-là savent écrire des chansons puis les formater pour tel ou tel public. Allez Tokio Hotel foutez-les tous dehors et montrez-nous ce que vous savez faire !! Au passage si vous pouviez laiser tomber ce look grotesque, ce serait pas mal non plus."

Voila le seul bemole à cette histoire, je suis en plein dans la cible. Seulement voila ce que cette fille peut appeller du rock n'en ai pas. Rock punk alors ? Non plus...Le rock punk a coulé avec les Clash et la haine de la societé qu'il exprimait appartient desormais au rap. Passons sur la pop et le Rock psykedelyque, je ne pense pas qu'on puisse comparer cette fille au Razorlights ou à Pink Floyd. Un retour à la simplicité alors ? Le Rock aurait donc travaillé pendant un demi siecle pour proposer des morceaux de plus en plus subtils et complexes pour finalement retomber dans les accords de guitare et les rythmes de batteries les plus basiques...? Si c'est le cas (et j'espere que non), le rock entame une trés longue decadence que je ne veut pas contempler..."
1,"La coloration blonde lui aurait-elle attaqué le cerveau? Cet album est très décevant et très médiocre en comparaison des deux premiers Pies Descalzos et Dónde están los ladrones? Je suis très déçu par cette évolution, je préférais nettement Shakira à ses débuts lorsqu'elle avait des idées, des chansons intéressantes et de bonnes mélodies."
5,"Ce 1 CD de Shakira est super. il annonce vraiment son succes present. et malgre son jeune age a la sortie du CD les paroles et les musiques sont , je trouve, tres matures."
4,avec ça voix envoutante elle vous ammene à Islande avec ses paysages mystique comme la musique. Elle vous entoure comme une bain chaude rien à dire c'est magnifique et cette musique vous ammene dans un monde parfait et irreel. Pas de tout glacée mais plutot rechauffant. Un musthave.
2,"Pourtant grand fan de Bjork, je suis avec impatience la sortie de chaque nouvel opus de l'islandaise et j'avoue que quand j'ai entendu pour la première fois le titre Earth Intruders, je me suis dit :""Ah, enfin, je vais retrouver du grand Bjork digne de l'époque d'Homogenic et Vespertine""! Et quelle ne fut pas ma déception en écoutant le reste de l'album qui n'est pas en accord du tout avec ce titre .... à part Earth Intruders, Wanderlust, Innocence et Declare Independance, le reste m'ennuie profondément. Certains sons paraissent repris de Vespertine mais sans le petit plus qui avait fait de cet album un vrai bijou. J'ai eu l'impression que Bjork n'avait pas su quoi mettre sur cet album et que l'inspiration lui avait cruellement manqué. Bref, j'attendais beaucoup trop peut-être de cet album après un Medulla sur lequel je n'avais pas accroché dès le début et auquel je me suis fait seulement après plusieurs écoutes.  En résumé, pour ceux qui veulent découvrir le monde de la diva islandaise, pour moi, cet album ne reflète absolument pas son génie."
2,"Il en va de Björk comme de la plupart des chanteuses (ou chanteurs) à voix très typée, d'Alanis Morissette à Ophélie Winter en passant par le castrat de Radiohead, Mika ou la Méduse des Cranberries : la particularité des inflexions vocales peut être un obstacle insurmontable, faisant se pâmer certains là où d'autres, par instinct de survie, se bouchent les oreilles. Depuis  , j'appartiens à la deuxième catégorie. Depuis que Björk n'écrit plus d'aussi bonnes chansons que celles de ses trois premiers albums en fait. Que retenir alors de ce ""Volta"", trop éclectique du fait des diverses collaborations et de la volonté peu radicale d'alterner chansons ""engagées"" et mièvreries radiophoniques ? Les morceaux reposant sur des orchestrations de cuivres épiques ou des rythmiques primitives comme le très Portishead ""Vertebrae by vertebrae"" et les trois singles ""Wanderlust"", le tribal ""Earth intruders"" et ""Innocence"" (ces deux derniers produits par Timbaland, et oui !). A la rigueur, ""Declare independence"" (autre single), appel acid-techno à l'indépendance, très premier degré, un peu Rage Against The Machine. Tout juste une moitié du disque donc. Malgré ses qualités musicales, ce disque s'inscrit hélas dans la ligne de la discographie post-  de la petite diva. Il plaira donc comme d'habitude aux fans mais c'est tout."
1,"Contre ceux qui pensent qu'Incubus ce n'est ""plus comme avant"" rétablissons les choses. C'est toujours comme avant et c'est bien ça le problème : toujours une belle musique sans trop d'âme. Incubus est devenu la caricature de la caricature de lui-même, les riffs se ressemblent, ont exploite toutes les combinaisons possibles d'accords en quinte. Bref, ce sont des bons musiciens mais il manque le ressenti, le côté humain. C'est pour cela qu'Incubus est toujours resté un groupe américain parmi d'autres. Au début la sauce prenait, mais aujourd'hui on en vient à les plaindre de ce syndrome de la ""page blanche"" qui conduit à ressasser les mêmes formules."
1,"Decidement le vivier de l'insignifiante variété made in France semble inépuisable, un vrai  ..  Calogero doit etre le fruit d'experimentations secretes d'un   dans les labo secret d'universal ou je ne sais quel autre major ; de ses délires est né ce croisement de Goldman et Obispo. Voila , tout est dit, au programme donc textes plats et pretentieux sur arrangements pompeux qui ne depareraient pas dans n'importe laquelle de ces  . Le top du   étant la collaboration avec GCM . J'ai pu lire ici que cet album sonnait moins rock que les précédents, euh, encore faudrait il avoir sonné  un jour.. D'autres nous parle de pop rock à l'anglaise, on est tout de meme plus prés de   que de  , faudrait arreter de prendre des   pour des  .. Aucun intéret donc sauf eventuellement  ."
2,"Ouaip... Il sonne bien, le nouveau Rammstein. Mais je trouve qu'ils ont quand même bien calmé le jeu. On dirait qu'ils s'engagent sur la voie qu'avait choisie Paradise Lost vers 1994/95, adoucir le ton et proposer un métal mâtiné de style Sisters Of Mercy grande époque... Je regrette un peu l'époque Hierate Mich, moi... A écouter, mais les fans des ambiances bien lourdes et malsaines des débuts risquent d'être déçus."
2,"Les fans du groupe ne cautionneront sans doute plus l'orientation prise sur le récent Reise, Reise tant Rosenrot s'adresse aux masses. Mis à part les assez agressifs ""Benzin"" (le nouveau hit metal qui n'égale jamais ""Amerika""), ""Mann gegen Mann"" et ""Zerstören"" (on est bien loin des énormes riffs acérés de Sehnsucht quand même!), la musique de Rammstein est devenu bien plus mélodique et accessible. Sur le titre planant ""Stirb nicht vor mir"", on a même droit à un duo avec la chanteuse du groupe Texas. Et puis ces quatre « ballades mélodiques » en allemand font froid dans le dos, tant ce chant martial ne s'adapte qu'aux titres bourrins. Et plutôt que de tourner déjà en rond, le groupe tente d'expérimenter, mais la sauce ne prend pas, l'accordéon sur ""Zerstören"" et surtout le risible ""Te Quiero Puta"" en sont l'exemple. Rammstein s'est lui même banalisé, ce n'est plus un groupe qui impressionne et on sent bien que cet album aurait été dispensable dans sa carrière. Et si Rammstein avait fait le tour du sujet en une seule année?"
1,"Fan de Joe Satriani depuis son premier album, j'avoue que le divin chauve me déçoit de plus en plus. Ce dernier album ne déroge hélas pas à la règle. C'est pour moi le pire album que notre surfeur d'argent est sorti, les titres donnent l'impression d'avoir été bâclés, il n'y a aucune imagination, il ne fait que reprendre en le faisant moins bien ce que l'on a déjà entendu dans ses albums précédents. Les fans seront certainement déçus, comme je le suis, par cet album. Un achat que l'on peut largement éviter."
1,"Ce Cd ne vaut rien , musicalement seul la plage 11 nous fait penser que l'on a investi dans dans quelque chose proche de la musique et encore une simple guitare saturée ou Neil Young place quelques accords et solos balancés au filing des images qui défilent devant lui.Tout le reste de la B.O n'est qu'une suite de bruitage mélangée au dialogue du film. Mon seul tort est d'avoir acheté les yeux fermés comme un con de Fan. Bref , vraiment à éviter."
2,"L'interprétation de Grimaud a voulu s'écarter des clichés trop langoureux qui pèsent sur cette musique. Mais ses choix sont loin de convaincre. Réitérant ses options appliquées dans Brahms, la pianiste n'offre qu'une percussion sèche en guise de puissance, quelques affectations en guise de conduite mélodique (elle ne maîtrise guère les structures organiques du discours polyphonique du compositeur). Certes la clarté technique est à saluer, mais elle tue l'élan de la virtuosité. Ashkenazy s'ennuie ferme, soigne quelques rares solos, mais le preneur de son s'est oublié. Lorsqu'une flûte seule sonne plus fort que le pupitre d'altos, lorsque des figures d'accompagnement au piano couvrent tout l'orchestre, il faut s'inquiéter de la qualité réelle du produit."
1,"La transcription des oeuvres pour clavier (clavecin, orgue) de Bach exige , malgré tout, que l'interprète se plie à ce qu'un auditeur assidu de l'oeuvre du Cantor retrouve dans toutes les interprétations qui comptent (Messe en si : Leonhardt, Harnoncourt, Herreweghe, Suzuki, Junghanel par exemple ; Variations Goldberg :Koroliov, Perahia; Gould ; Art de la Fugue : Goebel, Savall, Koroliov, Leonhardt, Isoir ...): la musicalité associée à la rigueur. La musique de Bach s'adresse à la fois à l'affect et la cérébralité. Elle exige une interprétation à la fois belle et lisible. La Messe en Si l'emporte par sa plastique avec en arrière-plan l'architecture. L'Art de la fugue, construction cérébrale s'il en fut, donne naissance à une beauté austère comme celle que l'on retrouve dans certaines églises romanes. Hélène Grimaud, interprète de très grand talent, n'est pas faite pour ce registre."
5,"Nombreux sont les sceptiques sur le talent de feu Jimi Hendrix, où plutôt nombreux sont ceux qui louent les talents du maître mais qui tombent d'ennui à l'écoute de l'un de ses disques qui raisonnera, au choix, soit trop seventies soit trop fouilli en raison de ces nombreuses notes enchaînées avec la virtuosité d'un employé d'une chaîne de montage. Mesdames, messieurs, si vous vous sentez concernés, et que vous aimez le Blues, celui qui pleure et qui hurle (à la manière du déchirant et néanmoins revigorant ""Born Under a Bad Sign""), cet album est pour vous ! On a tendance a occulter le fait que Jimi, à tort catalogué comme guitar hero rock, mélangeait tous les styles avec une dexterité surprenante, passant du rock au funk, du blues au jazz comme ça, comme s'il lui suffisait d'appuyer sur un bouton, et tout celà avec un sens de l'improvisation et un feeling inégalé à ce jour. Tous les grands et vieux guitaristes qui ont suivi ont essayé de reproduire ce style inimitable d'un gamin âgé de 27 ans à sa mort, sans succès notable et durable. Cette facette uniquement ""Blues"" de Jimi (qui est plus un prétexte ou un coup marketing, à vous de choisir, et pouvant paraître factice par moments tant un ou deux titres ne sonnent pas si blues que celà) s'exprime bien à travers cette oeuvre plus épurée qu'à l'accoutumée, et c'est un véritable chef d'oeuvre que vous aurez le plaisir d'écouter, du funky ""Mannish Boy"" au tranquille ""Once I Had A Woman"" (à la manière de ""Since I've Been Loving You"" des Zeppelin), sans oublier l'accoustique ""Hear My Train Comin'"" (exercice suffisament rare pour le noter) et le groovy ""Jelly 292"". Un vrai must de Jimi pourtant relativement méconnu."
2,"Certes, Karl Böhm est un grand chef d'orchestre et un musicien accompli, mais cette interprétation n'est plus ""écoutable"" aujourd'hui: la lourdeur et l'épaisseur de l'orchestre, la manière de chanter des solistes, le choeur peu lisible avançant parfois avec une lenteur sépulcrale... Allez du côté de Bernius chez Carus; là se trouve le clair-obscur, l'engagement, la spontanéité, bref la musique !"
2,"Le jeune vainqueur de la Star Academy nous a offert un permier album assez honorable. Sa postérité était assurée. C'était compter sans la rapacité de TF1 qui n'a pas hésité à lui faire enregistrer ce second et dernier album composé de quelques inédits et de standards et, là, nous sommes dans l'imposture. Il s'en tire honorablement dans ""Restons amis"" mais quand admettra-t-on qu'un chanteur, même talentueux, ne peut TOUT interpréter comme le révèlent ""The Show must Go On"", ""Et maintenant"" ou ""SOS d'un Terrien en détresse"" (tout le monde n'est pas Daniel Balavoine). Le pauvre garçon est au bout de ses limites physiques et, au risque de décevoir ses admiratrices, ce répertoirte n'est pas le sien.  Mais que ne ferait pas TF1 pour gagner de l'argent? Tant qu'il y aura des gogos pour acheter ce genre de disques et entrer en transes à chaque audition, le succès commercial est assuré. La lutte contre la mucovicidose (et la philanthropie en général) sont loin d'être une priorité de TF1."
5,"je n'ai pas beaucoup visionné les épisodes de la star ac dans laquelle Grégory chantait même si j'avais été impressionée par sa voix dans ""SOS"" et sa façon de regarder la caméra mais j'ai été touchée par son décès. Cela doit donner de l'espoir aux personnes atteintes de cette maladie mais aussi de toutes les autres maladies puisqu'il est allé jusqu'au bout de son rêve et de sa passion, il représente donc un modèle pour tous."
5,"De la très bonne musique!!!  On retrouve Greg tel qu'on l'aime.  Les quelques erreurs de jeunesse seront vites oubliées, car c'est un artiste authentique qui append vite!!! A acheter sans modération. Marc."
1,"c qu'il avait beau être un ange (encore que cela reste à vérifier car je l'ai pas connu personnellement)ce live montre une fois de + que c'était un chanteur comme tant d'autres de la variété bas de gamme, aucune originalité"
5,"C'est une BO magnifique, j'avais déjà le film et je voulais pouvoir écouter la musique du film partout ou je me trouvais, je l'avais en cassette qui c'était détériorée,c'est un pur bonheur."
1,"C'est vraiment pas bon : Souvent les instrumentalisations sont proches mais le bonhomme chante sans âme, sans profondeur. C'est du très mauvais copier-coller. Reprendre des chansons de Brel n'est pas chose facile et beaucoup s'y sont cassé les dents. Il n'a pas su se réapproprier les chansons, les mettre à sa sauce et nous surprendre. Ce n'est qu'une minable opération commerciale. Allez...Au suivant!"
2,"Je suis assez déçu du fait qu'il manque le morceau ""Peut-être une angine"". Cela veut-il dire que lorsqu'un album est moins cher on enlève des morceaux? Drôle de méthode........ Je serai désormais plus attentif sur le site d'Amazon."
1,"je suis navré mais il me faut de l'innovation je veux de la vraie musique ( album commun trop variété )   de nos jeunes artistes français et rebelote, tout le monde peut chanté la preuve , Je sais il faut un début à tout mais j'aimerai bien qu'un autodidacte prenne les choses en main ,bonne musique et bon chanteur ,ce n'est pas forcément mauvais mais ( ce n'est pas le paradis )  pour référence ex U.F Thiefaine ou J. Higelin et oui des vieux de la vielle. Pourtant Dominique et Ch Willem sortes du lot, mais faut il le prouver. (1 * pour la voie ) en sept mots il faut qu'il se prenne en main aller CH courage ce n'est pas la quantité mais la qualité le plus important"
1,Pas de quoi révolutionner la musique. Quelques titres sympas mais dans l'ensemble c'est plutôt banal. Je m'attendais franchement à mieux. On se lasse aprés quelques écoutes.
1,digne de l'euro vision. textes avec de la rime facile et musique de poseur
5,Ca peut ne pas plaire à tout le monde... Mélange d'une voix magnifique soul avec des rythmes fort à tendance pop electro. C'est particulier mais une chanson se dénnotera et plaira à beaucoup de monde (je pense qu'elle va faire un carton) c'est 'Crazy'.
2,"Henri Dès nous avait habitués à mieux! Je suis un peu déçue par la touche personnelle de Dès qui tourne les chansons de notre enfance un tant soit peu en dérision...Peut mieux faire!Pour moi, Henri ne sera pas le Père Noel chez moi cette année, même s'il se prend pour lui!"
5,"La première écoute m'a laissé stupéfait! Cette oeuvre, admirable de bout en bout a trouver son interprète. Un disque à thésauriser. PS: j'ignorais qu'il se trouve encore des personnes pour écouter des disques de Mac Geggan et surtout pour les conseiller...  Il est vrai que Jacobs, le plus ""gros vendeur"" de Harmonia Munidi n'a aucun talent et que les mélomanes qui achètent ses disques n'ont aucun goût. Tandis que les fadasseries vieillottes et assumées de Mac Geggan:, ça c'est quelque chose!"
5,"Prenez un chef japonais de confession chrétienne, organiste et claveciniste,  ayant poursuivi ses études en Europe avec Ton Koopman ; prenez un ensemble 100% japonais créé en 1990 dans le but de représenter au Japon les grandes oeuvres de l'ère baroque sur instruments historiques, comprenant une vingtaine d'instrumentistes et le même nombre de choristes, donnant quatre concerts Bach par an et accueillant des chanteurs européens ; prenez des enregistrements réalisés par les suédois à la chapelle de l'université féminine Shoin construite en 1981 à Kobe, avec une mise au point d'une acoustique exceptionnelle, pour les événements religieux et musicaux ; prenez le cinquantième anniversaire de la fin de la seconde guerre mondiale ; prenez un rythme d'enregistrements assez lent mais régulier, des solistes japonais permanents  et des invités européens, une suite chronologique des cantates, un livret en français très intelligent et très détaillé pour chaque oeuvre (mais les textes des cantates sont en allemand-anglais), une prise de son au service de la musique... et vous aurez certainement l'une des plus fabuleuses séries d'enregistrements consacrés à l'intégrale des cantates de Bach, passionnants à comparer avec leurs illustres aînés, d'un souci musicologique remarquable (les dilemmes instrumentaux sont à chaque fois justifiés par Suzuki lui-même). Une grande homogénéité donc qui fluctuera à peine en fonction du choix des solistes, et une exceptionnelle précision et justesse des instrumentistes. Il se dégage de ces enregistrements une impression d'évidence, un côté très « lisse », débarrassé des « tics » d'interprétation baroque habituels et de leurs cortèges d'instruments ne sonnant pas toujours très justes. Ce 39è volume est marqué par la présence pour la seconde fois (la précédente dans le volume 36) du violoncello da spalla, autrement dit un « violoncelle d'épaule » reconstruit par le soliste lui-même pour ces enregistrements. Une intéressante photo nous le montre comment tenir cet instrument à la technique bien particulière qui remplace ici le plus connu violoncelle piccolo. Les solistes instrumentaux sont donc ici à l'honneur : dans BWV175, deux trompettes, trois flûtes à bec accompagnent les chants dans des exercices virtuoses mettant la justesse à rude épreuve et s'en tirent évidemment remarquablement bien ; dans BWV28, ce seront trois hautbois en contrepoint, puis deux pour BWV85."
2,"procurez vous l'enregistrement de kuijken et leonardt.il date un peu,il a des défaut que vous arriverez a pardonner aisément.Travail intègre. Si vous êtes d'accord avec moi vous poursuivrez avec le Zaïs de Leonardt.le livret de cahuzac est trés beau(sur la forme et sur le fond)et la musique de Rameau est à pleurer de bonheur.Leonardt est un grand interprète de Bach (contemporain de Rameau)c'est pourquoi je conseille de passer par la case Leonardt pour atteindre Rameau.A vous de juger."
5,"J'ai decouvert Bob Dylan grace a ce CD, je n'aimais pas du tout sa musique a l'epoque ou ma mere l'a acheté, elle a fini par me le faire ecouter dans la voiture (de maniere tres strategique d'ailleur, elle m'a d'ailleur fais ecouter les morceaux les plus rock ce qui m'a donné envie d'ecouter le reste) et ca a été pour moi une revelation. 8mois plus tard, je possede une grande partie de ses meilleurs CDs. Cette compilation n'est pas un ""Best of"", c'est un ""Essentials"", ce qui signifie que ce n'est pas ses meilleures chansons, ce sont ses indispensables. Et ca tiens meme pas sur deux CDs d'apres moi, 3 ou 4 CDs bien remplis serait deja bien juste. Tres bonne compilation en tout cas, tres bien balancée et les morceaux sont bien choisi. Rien n'est a jeter et c'est une exellente façon de faire decouvrir Bob. A envoyer en masses pour noel!"
4,"A longueur d'interviews, l'Iguane ne s'en cache pas: « à la maison, je n'écoute que Frank Sinatra ». Evidemment, venant d'un homme, d'un animal plutot d'ailleurs, qui a su déchainer foudre, foutre et feu à la tête de ses Stooges aujourd'hui décimés, la déclaration a de quoi surprendre, mais ceux qui avaient su préter l'oreille a Avenue B par exemple n'en sauront pas tant désarconnés que ca.  Comme chacun a pu le lire à droite, ou à gauche, l'album est inspiré de La Possibilité d'une île, le roman de Michel Houellebecq et avant tout destiné à un public francophone/francophile, bref, en ces temps moroses sur l'hexagone Iggy nous offre un cadeau soyeux et raffiné, prouvant par la même que s'il égal notre cher président par la taille, il le surpasse sans difficulté aucune par la générosité.  Album que l'on pourrait presque qualifier de cocooneux, chaud et doux, terriblement sensuel avec le bluesy ""Je sais que tu sais"", les arpèges romantique ""I Want To Go to the Beach"" ou encore un ""King of the Dogs"" tous cuivres dehors directement sortis de la Nouvel Orléans. Bien entendu la reprise des ""Feuilles Mortes"" de Prévert et Kosma fera parler d'elle, mais c'est bel et bien l'album tout entier qui se révéle être une surprenante réussite jazzy-croonée (la réussite)."
2,"J'attendais beaucoup de cet album. J'ai été amèrement déçu ! Non pas par la qualité musicale qui est excellente mais par le chant du grand Bob, qui apparemment n'étais pas au mieux de sa forme ni très motivé par le challenge « Unplugged ». Dommage, ce live aurait pu entrer dans l'anthologie, mais il demeurera un album live moyen  comme tant d'autres !"
5,"Mieczyslaw (Moishei) Weinberg (Vainberg) est né en 1919 à Varsovie. Fils d'un violoniste et compositeur travaillant pour un théâtre juif de la capitale polonaise, il étudia le piano au conservatoire avec Josef Turczynski. L' occupation allemande le força à fuir la Pologne en 1939, et il se réfugia en URSS. Il vécut tout d'abord quelque temps à Minsk, où il étudia la composition avec Vassili Zolotarov, un élève de Balakirev et de Rimski-Korsakov. En 1941, il s'installa à Tachkent, et envoya le manuscrit de sa première symphonie à Dmitry Chostakovitch, qui réagit avec enthousiasme et l'invita à Moscou, où Weinberg résidera de 1943 jusqu'à sa mort, survenue en 1996.  La Fantaisie pour violoncelle et orchestre Op. 52, composée en 1951-1953, a été crée le 23 novembre 1953, dans une réduction pour violoncelle et piano préparée par le compositeur, par Daniil Shafran et Nina Musinian ; il n'existe toutefois aucune trace de la création de la version orchestrale, bien que cette oeuvre ait été enregistrée du temps de l'Union Soviétique (Alla Vasilieva, violoncelle ; Moscow Chamber Orchestra, Rudolf Barshaï, dir. ; LP Melodiya CM 01991-2). Le violoncelle était l'un des instruments de prédilection de Weinberg, instrument pour lequel il a en particulier écrit un concerto (Rostropovich: The Russian Years : Mstislav Rostropovich, violoncelle ; USSR Symphony Orchestra, Gennady Rozhdestvensky ; EMI Classical, 1997 - ASIN : B000002SHY ; ou EMI, 2000 - ASIN : B0000247G5. Ou Mark Drobinsky, violoncelle ; State Cinematographic Orchestra, dirigé par Walter Mnatsakanov ; Russian Disc 10 071, 1997 - ASIN B000001LMU), deux sonates avec piano (Alla Vasilieva, violoncelle ; Moisei Vainberg, piano ; Russian Disc 11 026, 1998 - ASIN B000001LNS), un très bel ensemble de Vingt-Quatre Préludes pour violoncelle seul (Yosif Feigelson, violoncelle ; Olympia OCD 594, 1996 - ASIN B0000264U5) et quatre Sonates pour violoncelle seul (Yosif Feigelson, violoncelle ; Olympia OCD 594 &amp; 643, 1996 &amp; 1997 - ASIN B0000264U5 &amp; B00000HZX6). La Fantaisie pour violoncelle, qui comporte plusieurs très beaux thèmes mélodiques, est en un seul mouvement, avec une structure en arche définie par une accélération, puis une décélération progressive : Adagio, Andante leggiero, Allegro con fuoco, Cadense, Andante leggiero, Adagio. Elle présente une surprenante proximité stylistique avec les quatre très remarquables symphonies de chambre, classiques et très épurées, que Weinberg écrira beaucoup plus tard, entre 1986 et 1992.  Le premier concerto pour flûte et orchestre à cordes Op. 75 est également une oeuvre qui mérite d'être connue ; le concerto a été écrit à l'intention de son dédicataire, le flûtiste Alexandre Korneïev, qui en assura la création avec l'Orchestre de Chambre de Moscou dirigé par Rudolf Barchaï le 25 novembre 1961, dans la Grande Salle du Conservatoire de Moscou. Le premier mouvement, aux allures de scherzo, est très brillant et très impétueux, en opposition radicale avec le mouvement lent suivant qui se déroule à la manière d'une passacaille introspective au coloris sombre, qui exploite le registre grave de la flûte. Le Finale débute par une valse dans le style klezmer, comme si souvent et si habilement jaillie de l'imagination du compositeur ; il s'achève dans une atmosphère incertaine, où des moments d'un bonheur simple et serein alternent avec des évocations plus sombres.  Comme le premier, le second concerto pour flûte et orchestre Op. 148 est dédié à Alexandre Korneïev. Il est instrumenté pour orchestre symphonique ; il en existe toutefois une version pour orchestre à cordes, désignée comme l'opus 148 bis et datée du 17 octobre 1987. La version pour grand orchestre a été donnée pour la première fois hors de Russie, et peut-être même au monde, le 23 octobre 2001 lors d'un concert à Boràs, en Suède, sous la direction de Thord Svedlung. Le climat général de l'oeuvre peut-être qualifié de ""pastoral"". Le premier mouvement, Allegro, semble tout d'abord tracer une arche prévisible quand, soudain, une diversion sous forme de fugato permet à la musique, tantôt enjouée, tantôt sévère, de prendre des chemins détournés et inattendus, avant de revenir à son point de départ. D'emblée mélancolique, le second mouvement, Largo, emprunte, lui, une voie plus austère, menant à une conclusion morose. Comme dans de nombreux finales weinbergiens, l'Allegretto présente des formules proches de la danse, aux textures sobres et aux harmonies insaisissables. Weinberg y introduit subrepticement des citations de l'Orfeo et Euridice de Gluck, de la Badinerie de la Deuxième Suite BWV 1067 de Bach, et une allusion mélancolique au Concerto pour violon de Brams mène à une conclusion, au moins en apparence, tranquille.  Le concerto pour clarinette et cordes Op. 104, composé en 1970, est un joyaux attendant d'être découvert. Les trois mouvements de ce concerto respectent l'ordre traditionnel vif-lent-vif, et le langage en est austère. Bien que n'utilisant pas à proprement parler la technique du sérialisme, cette œuvre sans tonalité utilise de nombreuses possibilités d'un chromatisme très radical, ce qui la rattache de fait aux œuvres (librement) dodécaphoniques. La texture de l'Allegro initial est sobre, la clarinette s'élevant peu à peu en motifs hérissés et oscillants sur fond d'accompagnement aux pizzicatos insistants. Le mouvement lent est d'un caractère lyrique et chaleureux. La danse à la fois triste et insolente qui constitue le final subit de multiples métamorphoses, avant d'aboutir à une dernière danse agile, à une fausse fin trompeuse et, enfin, à une cadence."

5,"Du JIMI à fleur de peau, nous entrainant dans un univers aux rythmes choraliques où se mèlent douceur et riffs sur fond psychadélique. Cet album nous révèle la sensibilité du Grand Jimi Hendrix. Pour moi le meilleur!!."

2,"Ce n'est pas un très mauvais album mais je ne vois pas tellement l'intérêt du truc. C'est de la chanson française de bonne facture sans plus. J'ai reçu le CD au boulot (je bosse dans les médias), je l'ai écouté et je sais que je ne le réécouterai pas. J'attendais un ovni... c'est une voiture de série"
2,"Présenté ici et là comme une suite possible à l'insondable Thimar, paru en 1998, cet enregistrement n'en est que plus décevant.. Les compositions sont tout à fait indigentes (on a un peu l'impression d'assister à une jam session de musiciens ayant peu en commun). Les musiciens semblent peu concernés - à part Brahem lui-même, mais de façon sporadique, ses interventions parfois magiques étant constamment polluées par une clarinette basse gloussante et une basse électrique aux sonorités fusion bien ringardes. Le tout enregistré dans un studio dont j'ignorais l'existence ( Udine, Italie ) cumulant les poncifs ECM (cet écho-cho-cho-cho...) sans en avoir les qualités habituelles ( l'espace ).. On a l'impression que cette session a été enregistrée dans un tonneau.. Bref, il existe beaucoup de bons disques de Brahem (en gros, tous les autres) avant de dépenser ses deniers pour celui-ci."
2,"Grosse déception ! Je lis à gauche à droite le mot ""électro"", ce que je ne retrouve pas dans cet album. Quant à la comparaison avec Ninja Tune, c'est pas gentil pour Amon Tobin, Funki Porcini et autres as du sampler. Car voilà le problème: il ne s'agit plus d'un travail de collages de sons comme sur le premier album. Tout est live, avec orchestre et tout le toutim. Adieu donc le délire, et bonjour la soul classieuse de bon ton. Bon, si on aime ça, c'est ok. Mais mon sentiment est que ça ressemble à une BO seventy, avec l'inspiration en moins. Quant à la chanson Gainsbourienne ""God bless Billie"", je ne sais pas si je dois rire ou pleurer. Pour terminer, je ne me permettrai pas de critiquer le DVD: je n'ai pas eu la patience de regarder les chapitres en entier (...). En résumé, amateurs d'électro et d'abstract hip hop, passer votre chemin. Voilà donc mon avis très suggestif !"
5,"Après un premier album déjà très convaincant (un peu plus sombre, plus faisant ambiance de film), voici le deuxième opus. Je suis étonné que ce groupe ne soit pas plus connu, c'est vraiment exceptionnel comme musique ."

En résumé, amateurs d'électro et d'abstract hip hop, passer votre chemin. Voilà donc mon avis très suggestif !"
1,"C'est triste de voir un CD comme çà se vendre. Bon d'accord que les petites filles achèttent parce qu'il y a des ""gros mots"" et qu'il se moque du Mac Do mais il ne faut pas abuser! Il y a beaucoup d'autres CD plus interessant."
1,"Voila un album lisse , sans personnalité, sans ame,La belle Natasha chanterai le bottin que ce serait pareil: textes plats, melodies faibles, voix pleurnicharde, bref la ""patte"" Obispo.. Ce gars là, il fait toujours la meme chose, pour lui ou pour les autres; remarquez c'est pratique , on a ecouté une chanson, on a pas besoin d'ecouter le reste; ce sont toujours les memes musiques mielleuses et les memes textes ""sortez les kleenex-collection arlequin-la petite maison dans la prairie"" .C'est un vrai fléau qui dessert avec constance les talents , on lui aurait confié Piaf et Barbara , il en aurait fait des Sheila ou Lorie.. Je n'ai rien contre Natasha qui a  peut-etre un peu de talent et une jolie voix, mais aprés les comedies musicales niaises et l'""usine"" Obispo, il serait peut etre temps pour elle de passer à autre chose et d'affirmer un style propre sous peine d'oubli rapide.."
2,"Bonjour, Cet album est beaucoup plus personnel que les autres. Natasha se dévoile beaucoup plus et c'est la raison pour laquelle les sujets semblent moins variés. Etant musicien, je suis déçu par la diversité musicale de l'album. On apprécie que les textes soit aussi peaufinés mais malheureusement au détriment de l'architecture musicale. Il faut savoir que P. Obispo a joué un rôle moins important que sur les autres albums(à tort ou à raison). Bref, c'est une question de goût !  La voix reste aussi belle mais parfois un peu trop retenue. C'est dommage. Allez la voir en concert dès que possible. Quel régal pour les oreilles ! j'en sort toujours avec des frissons."
5,"Muse réussit l'exploit avec 3 musiciens, dont 2 statiques, d'occuper l'espace gigantesque de la scène érigée dans le Wembley Stadium et la mise en scène réussit à rendre cet espace très vivant et animé. Les effets visuels du réalisateur qui joue beaucoup sur les couleurs sont assez réussis. Sur le plan musical Muse assure parfaitement sur tous les morceaux. C'est parfait et Matthew Bellamy donne une fois de plus la preuve de son immense talent. Ma seule légère déception vient de la sélection des titres du DVD. Plusieurs des titres les plus importants et attendus manquent, dommage."
5,"A tous ceux qui s'intéressent un peu au début de la musique électronique, je conseille fortement d'acheter cet album. Jarre a révolutionné la musique moderne. Alors qu'en 1976 il était impensable de faire de la musique sans paroles, lui a IMPOSE partout sa musique instrumentale, unique et futuriste. Des sons organiques provoquant des émotions ont lancé sa carrière.A tous ceux qui pensent que JARRE est démodé, écoutez le générique de la pub pour la C5 de Citroën, vous serez surpris de savoir que c'est Oxygène(part 2). Merci JMJ, pour avoir traversé les âges..."
1,"Voilà encore un titre qui se fait remarqué "" c'est bien français "". Et oui, toujours des chansons avec des mélodies plats, aucune recherche à ce niveau là. Je me suis ennuyé à l'écoute de ce single, il n'y a aucune énergie et même on est pas captivé par cette mélodie proposé par JJ Goldman. Pourtant ce dernier a fait de très bonne production dans les années 80 : là-bas, la vie par procuration, ell a fait un bébé toute seule etc (des chansons avec des mélodies assez puissant et bien trouvé)."
4,"Cher Yannick, Merci à toi , tes musiciens et toute l'équipe pour ce fabuleux moment que tu nous offres à travers ta musique et les textes, après avoir vibrés avec toi sur les cours de tennis. Quelle bouffée de joie venue du plus profond de toi, de tes racines africaines, imprégnées de ta vie en France, de tes exploits tennistiques, de ta vie de famille, ... Comme chacun de nous, tu es un pélerin de passage sur cette terre, tu es unique. En écoutant les textes, en lisant à travers les lignes, tu sembles avoir vécu une expérience forte et vraie, frôlant la Lumière qui nous donne cette Force d'aimer. Merci de nous l'avoir partager. Cette après-midi au retour de l'école, nous avons dansé avec nos enfants sur quelques-unes de tes chansons.A travers le reportage à la télé de ton concert au cirque royal (Bruxelles - Belgique)- il y a un bon moment déjà-, il est évident que ce fut un moment ""magique"" de communion entre vous (les artistes) et le public se terminant dans les rues avoisiantes !! J'espère la prochaine fois y participer aussi. En attendant, il y a ton nouveau Live.  Merci pour tout ce que tu nous donnes et continueras à nous donner (vivement ton prochain CD), pour nous aider à retrouver ce regard vrai et positif sur les autres, sur le monde à travers cette vraie joie d'Afrique (malgré tout ...). Bonne route sur le chemin de la vie entourés de l'amour des tiens. Merci de rayonner cette flamme de feu qui es en toi et qui nous réchauffe le coeur lors de nos ""hivers intérieurs"". Aksanti Sana ! (= Merci beaucoup en Swaeli - RDC)."
5,J'adore cet album ! Encore une fois Yannick Noah a su s'entourer d'excellents auteurs-compositeurs et il chante vraiment avec tout son coeur et tout son corps (je l'ai vu sur scène !).
2,"Tu as posé tes raquettes, fort bien, tu as saisi un micro, pourquoi pas ? Es-tu, cependant un véritable chanteur ? Tu fus un véritable tennis man, c'est vrai ...Pardon, mais je suis ravi que tu aies trouvé un public mais, pour moi tu restes un joueur, joueur de tennis mais plus joueur que chanteur. Alors, bravo, pour les arrangements musicaux, pour quelques textes bien sentis mais comme ta voix ne me charme pas, je te laisse tes fans et je m'en vais user mes oreilles sur d'autres mélodies."
2,"Largement decevant pour tous ceux qui ont découvert Tom avec le premier album... je ne vois plus de continuité... l'album possède des sonorités actuelles qui plairont à certain, nettement moins à d'autres... Adieu folk et bonjour ""brouillasseries"" commerciales !"
2,"Ce qui est énervant avec la hype, c'est qu'on se laisse toujours piéger pour peu qu'on soit à la recherche de musique nouvelle, d'émotions fraîches. Je m'étais ému en entendant citer comme référence à propos de The xx, Young Marble Giants, puis inquiété en lisant que le groupe avait passé plus de temps à trouver son nom qu'à composer ses chansons. Eh bien, ça s'entend ! Car, au delà d'un indiscutable plaisir à se laisser dériver au fil d'atmosphères éthérées mais sensuelles et (un peu) électriques (quand même), l'auditeur le plus généreux devra bien reconnaître une terrible faiblesse des compositions, dans l'ensemble difficiles à simplement mémoriser, sur cet album - dont on risque bien, avec le temps, de ne retenir que la pochette astucieuse. Car si les rêveries diaphanes et les paysages immobiles et à plat de YMG ont peut-être bien inspiré Oliver et Romy, il y a clairement un sévère malentendu ici : ""Colossal Youth"", ce chef d'œuvre, était avant tout un disque de GRANDES chansons... Ce double X n'est certainement pas le chromosome de l'inspiration !"
5,"Moins immédiatement séduisant que le tonitruant Whatever people say I am, that's what I'm not (2006), ce second album du groupe de Sheffield confirme cependant avec éclat l'incroyable talent d'Alex Turner. Les textes sont nettement plus  percutants et le son moins lourd : hormis le titre d'ouverture, Brainstorm, l'influence de Nirvana, bizarrement passée sous silence par les commentateurs, s'est dissipée. Cette nouvelle galette est donc plus traditionnellement britannique : on retrouvera donc ici parsemées des citations des Smiths (Teddy Picker, The Bad thing), du ska de Madness ou des Specials (This house is a circus) voire (si, si) des Shadows - également originaires du Nord de l'Angleterre. Pour autant, le style des Arctic monkeys est distinctif et il faut vraiment ne pas connaître la musique pour ne pas noter cette vertu rare ces jours dans le rock britannique: leur originalité. Comme son illustre prédécesseur, Ray Davies, le petit Alex aura sous peu envie de mettre des cordes et des cuivres dans ses petites compositions : on attend la suite avec impatience. Meilleur titre : l'irrésistible Old yellow bricks."
1,"déjà le premier album était assez nul mais alors là on touche le fond: cet album est nul et pire que tout. Voilà un groupe qui ne sait ni jouer, ni composer une mélodie digne de ce nom. Je ne comprends pas comment paul weller lui même peut les adouber. Aucun morceau ne se détache de cette bouillie infâme particulièrement mal chantée et dire que ce groupe se réclame de ses grands héritiers de la colasse ouvrière du passé. Il en est à des années lumière. 0 part peut être la plume du chanteur et sa bouille, ce groupe n'a vraiment rien pour lui à part une hype qui va d'ailleurs les laisser tomber très vite vu le niveau atteint."
5,Cette nouvelle compilation n'est pas faite pour ceux qui connaissent très bien Michel Polnareff. Pour ceux qui veulent le découvrir ou mieux le connaître c'est une très bonne compilation : de superbes chansons et mélodies.
5,"Bien sur il y eut le célèbre Enola Gay qui tourna en boucle sur de nombreuses platines avant l'invention du CD, mais il y eut aussi un groupe phare de la new wave qui savait distiller des superbes mélodies avec une grande richesse de sons tirés de leurs synthés (analogiques à l'époque !) et la belle voix grave du chanteur J'ai aussi le souvenir d'un excellent concert dans lequel tous ces morceaux furent joués (ça devait être en 81 ou 82... ouahh quelle claque !!) Il y a probablement un petit air de nostalgie dans ce CD, mais surement beaucoup de plaisir"
2,"Il semblerait qu'au moment de sortir cet album la maison de disque ait oublié d'ajouter un ""trop"" entre le ""beaucoup"" et le ""de Gilbert Becaud"". Mis a part cet ouli regrettable voilà un bon best of, qui a l'originalité de rassembler les meilleures chansons de l'ex mari de Daniela Lumbroso."
1,"Je suis assez perplexe devant cette énième compilation de Polnareff. D'abord parce qu'il y aura bientôt plus de compilations dans sa discographie que d'albums originaux. Ensuite parce que le choix des titres est assez lourd : les chefs d'oeuvres (Ame câline, Qui a tué grand'maman, etc.) cotoyant des titres annecdotiques (Ne me marchez pas sur les pieds, Chère Véronique, etc.). Il y a tant de titres inédits dans les tiroirs, d'enregistrements de concerts mémorables, et tout simplement de disques introuvables de Polnareff, qu'on ne peut-être que déçu par le manque d'imagination de ce coffret qui ne fait que ressembler aux autres. Pour un prix sensiblement identique on conseillera plutôt au néophite l'achat du coffret ""Les premières années"", qui en 3 CDs reprend l'intégralité des chansons de Polnareff au temps de sa splendeur (de 1966 à 1972). Rien n'empêche ensuite de complèter par les albums originaux. Enfin, pour qui suit sa carrière depuis longtemps, il est assez frustrant que Polnareff (qui n'a pas sorti d'album original depuis 1990) autorise ce coffret qui sur 100 chansons ne compte qu'UN inédit. De mauvaises langues (que je réprouve, bien entendu) pourraient-être tentées de chanter : ""Fan qui m'aime C'est ton ton ton ton Pognon que j'aime Vive les compilations"" !!"
2,"Dans quelques siecles , des chercheurs se pencheront sur ce qu'ils nommeront ""la grande décadence culturelle du 21ème siècle""; si toutefois le phénomène s'inverse, sinon..il n'y aura plus de chercheurs (à ce sujet voir ce  ).Ils essaieront de comprendre comment un pays qui fut celui des   était devenu celui de l' . Pourquoi on était passé en quelques decennies de   ,Piaf et Brassens à Obispo , Lorie et Maé ;de   à  ; de Zola et Vian à Musso et Lévy...ILs constateront que la mievrerie ambiante avait étouffé tout esprit critique ; que matraquage et formatage des majors et télés-radios avaient étouffé toute créativité et curiosité chez l'auditeur; aboutissant à une production de masse et au succés d'artistes qui n'en avaient que le nom, dépourvus de talent, de charisme, et d'humour.Et comme sujet  de leur étude c'est ce cd de Gregoire qu'ils écouteront...une telle contribution à la science, ca valait bien une deuxieme étoile, non?"
4,"""Homework"": des rythmes sensibles, sourds ou boxeurs. Des mélodies que l'on devinne derrière le son des basses enflammées; Revolution 909, oui c'est bien une révolution - Daft Punk naît et renaît autour du monde - Alive, des morceaux vivants et vibrants. Alive pur perle tremblante de puissance. ""Homework"" travail fait à la main sur des sons nouveaux. ""Homework"" symbole d'une époque révolue. ""Homework"" allure musicale impassable et inlassable. ""Homework"", la musique éternelle."
4,"Ce nouvel album va surement en dérouter plus d'un : au contraire des albums précédents, plus toniques, au son relativement commercial et proche d'autres groupes comme Radiohead, cet album est éclectique, plus raffiné. Le groupe exprime maintenant une vraie personnalité en donnant à chaque morceau une atmosphère propre et des paroles plus engagées. Cet album risque de perdre en route pas mal de fans et c'est dommage car il est excellent sur les arrangements, sur les compositions et surtout il est original. On y retrouve des influences des années 80 (U2 notamment) et du début des années 90. A écouter et surtout à réécouter plusieurs fois pour s'imprégner de l'atmosphère particulière qu'il dégage."
1,"Fan de Muse depuis le debut, j'ai étais vraiment deçu par cet album. C'est de la soupe pour vendre vraiment indigeste.Si vous voulez les decouvrir, acheter leur 2 premiers albums qui valent vraiment le coup."
5,"Nous changeons de registre pour venir y faire la publicité d'un album de très haute qualité devant mériter la première place dans votre panthéon de la musique Cubaine. Les Buesna VIsta Social Club y regroupe tout l'essence naturelle de la musique Cubaine, riche en chaleur et en intensité : une vraie fontaine de jouvence à tel point que l'on ne peut s'empêcher de danser au rythme effréné dès la première chanson qui se trouve être une reprise quasi-parfaite du maitre du genre  . La suite sera une reprise du grand   à travers ""De Camino a la Vereda"", qui vous souhaite la bienvenu dans la chaleur Cubaine.   se vera à l'honneur par ""Pueblo Nuevo"". Une reprise de l'unique   avec ""Y Tú Qué Has Hecho?"". Puis on tombe sur une composition de la belle  , flamenco quand tu nous tiens !   aura l'honneur de ""El Carretero"", sensationnel d'émotion.   sera jouer à travers ""Candela"". Buesna Vista Social Club, vous l'avez compris n'invente rien, ne fait que reprendre et interpréter à merveille il faut le dire, des classiques du genre de la musique Cubaine. Mettant ainsi en lumière de la musique inoubliable qui saura vous transpercer d'émotion et de chaleur....  en prime dans une culture à part: la Cubaine . Durée : 60minutes - 14Titres."
5,"M signe là son meilleur album, le plus travaillé à mon goût, le plus mélancolique aussi. Ecoutez-le le matin et certaines chansons vous restent en tête toute la journée. Une pure merveille."
5,"Pour commencer une petite digression. Pour ceux qui ont lu da Vinci code et anges et démons, on a l'impression de lire le même livre avec les chapitres et les lieux disposés autrement. L'intrigue est quasiment la même, on lit la même histoire montée différemment. Le rapport avec Muse et cet album? On retrouve tout ce qui fait Muse, toute l'inspiration qui guide cette formation depuis ses débuts, aussi bien une solide base musicale classique qu'un côté rock très poussé, une signature vocale reconnaissable entre toute. On a la sensation que tout l'album a déjà été entendu précédemment éparpillé (pas façon puzzle par contre) dans les autres compositions antérieures (exogénésis y compris) et pourtant tout est différent et novateur (ou presque faut pas exagérer non plus)tout ce qui fait qu'on achète sans avoir écouter aucun titre avant parce qu'on est sûr du résultat. Bon il y a toujours un titre un peu cucul qui ne devrait pas exister (j'ai nommé ici guiding light) mais le reste quelle claque. La voix de Bellamy toujours aussi juste et présente, la voix de sa guitare qui chante avec autant de talent, une basse qui donne envie d'apprendre à en jouer, du piano et ils ont même envoyé les violons cette année. Bref à recommander et pour ceux qui découvre le groupe avec cet album, n'attendez pas le best of de Muse, ils y auront pas droit. En effet chez eux best of devra s'écrire ""L'Intégrale"" (moins les cuculs bien sûr)"
1,"Simplement mauvais : du Metallica tout craché sans aucune originalité, si ce n'est la grosse production, comme on pouvait s'y attendre. Aucun intérêt, sauf pour secouer la tête comme un crétin sur des titres qui, s'ils ont au moins le mérite d'être bien construits, manquent cruellement d'âme. Sans rancune, la pochette est aussi assez affreuse et peu représentative de ce que renferme cet album."
5,"je l'ai découvert avec black parade puis teenager, 2 morceaux tres differents. Mais si tout l'album propose une atmosphere identique (la mort, la maladie), les musiques sont differentes, il n'y a pas un theme arrangé de différentes manières, il y a plusieurs styles (mama est unique en son genre) et l'album est excellent de bout en bout. L'album de l'année peut être."
5,"....il était attendu....et enfin le voilà !!l'album solo du chanteur du groupe SOAD. Pour les fans et ceux qui ne connaisse pas Système Of A Down, on ne peux qu'être CONQUIS de cet opus, entre le chant de Tankian et les mélodies, toujours en recherche d'originalité. Cet album, dans la pure ligné des autres albums de SOAD est SUPERBE! On ne s'en lasse pas, car il y a besoin d'un certain nombre d'écoute pour tout découvrir. On ne retrouvera pas dans cet album, le chant de Daron  Malakian , album solo oblige. Pour la petite parenthèse et d'un point de vue personnel, je trouve la voix de Daron trés complémentaire et enrichissante dans le lyrisme des chants de SAOD. DONC JE NE PEUX QUE CONSEILLER CE SUPER ALBUM SOLO DE SERJ TANJIAN !! UNE MERVEILLE A LA HAUTEUR DE CE QU'EST SOAD !!"
1,"Lisa Gerrard n'apparait nul part sur le cd, que j'ai acheté. Fan de Lisa Gerrard je me retrouve avec un disque de pop moyenne sans aucun intéret."
2,"Grand fan de blink parmi tant d'autres, j'attendais ce nouvel album avec impatience. Il va donc falloir être très patient et attendre le prochain pour satisfaire les amateurs de punk à l'état pur. Blink avait su nous ravir avec ""Dude ranch"" et ""Take off your pants &amp; jackets"", mais à ce coup-là on reste sur notre faim. Attention, les morceaux sont loin d'être mauvais, simplement ils s'inscrivent dans un registre musical différent."
1,"Tous les goûts sont dans la nature et je respecte profondemment les personnes qui ont aimé cet album;je le trouve insupportable:cette voix de castra semble presque paradoxale avec le genre de musique que tout le monde semble leur coller à la peau;de plus j'ai la désagréable impression que c'est toujours la même chose:ils pourraient utiliser plus d'instruments à vent ou des cordes pour enrichir leur écriture.Les gens doués pour l'instrumentalisation mais qui ont l'humilité de reconnaitre qu'ils ont des voix pourries semblent se tourner vers de l'instrumental.La sensation Rock on pourrait peut être la retrouver chez Weather Report ou Miles Davis dans sa période fusion;Ou sinon dans le même genre que Placebo ,y a Depeche Mode (avec une voix sublime en prime)."
1,"Le chanteur sans voix, sans charisme et sans talent récidive avec un nouvel opus. Que dire, sinon que l'ennui est une fois de plus au rendez-vous ? La chanson française se porte bien. Réjouissons-nous !"
5,"Super musique, cool et riche: un anti-stress à prescrire de toute urgence! De nombreuses inspirations selon Thomas Dybdahl lui-même, mais un originalité incomparable... Indispensable!"
5,"On entend ici et là beaucoup de choses sur le dernier Herman Düne : ils ont signé avec une Major (sous entendu : ils ont vendu leur âme au diable). Les deux frères se chamailleraient et le groupe aurait du plomb dans l'aile. L'album serait trop produit, etc. L'important n'est pas là chers amis. L'important c'est que Giant est un excellent album. L'important c'est que les mélodies, les paroles, et même les arrangements (effectivement beaucoup plus léchés qu'avant) sont tout simplement magnifiques. L'important c'est qu'une fois qu'on met cet album dans la platine, on n'arrive plus à écouter autre chose. L'important c'est que les Dünes continue à faire leur musique et qu'on se dit en l'écoutant qu'ils ont encore une fois produit l'album de l'année."
4,"Le son de cet album marque une evolution nette par rapport aux precedents: on y trouve plus de guitare electrique, un son plus rock, voire punk, avec quelques touches d'electronique 80's, et meme une pincee de reggae! Il y a donc une evolution, pas desagreable et plutot positive, mais qui deroute un peu le fan au debut. Bien sur, les melodies envoutantes de Murdoch sont toujours la, un peu moins melancoliques qu'avant, un peu plus musclées, et l'album est un vrai succes. Franchement, un tres bon album, dans la continuite de l'évolution du groupe, amorcée avec I'm waking up to us."
5,"Bizarrement, au travers des commentaires, personne n'a simplement remarqué à quel point la voix de Jason Lytle, ex-Grandaddy, était encore plus déchirante qu'auparavant. Pour cet album, Lytle a joué de tous les instruments et a parcouru le monde entier. Dès la première chanson, l'obsession Grandaddienne est présente : retourner à la maison. ""I'm coming home"", et cette fois-ci, à force de le vouloir, il y est bel et bien retourné. Le problème, c'est qu'il y est tout seul et toute l'histoire de ce disque serait, au fond, de savoir comment il va la remplir à nouveau maintenant que le jouet Grandaddy est cassé. La réponse à cette question est ce disque, un disque simple, direct,""home-made blood"" comme dirait un autre, et qui me serre le coeur à chaque écoute. ""Yours, truly"" est l'album d'un homme qui n'a jamais cherché à devenir une rock-star mais un artiste à la poursuite de l'impossible sérénité. Créateur d'une lo-fi panoramique, Lytle continue le chemin mené par Grandaddy et ne recule pas d'un pouce concernant sa vision de la musique : un mélange de guitares crunchy et de sons éthérés sur une voix à son plus haut niveau émotionnel. Là où Malkmus de Pavement a baissé pavillon en solo, Lytle étend son Eldorado et ne cède pas sur son univers.  Cet homme mérite notre plus total respect."
1,"Pour ceux qui, comme moi, avaient adoré les premiers albums de Grandaddy et vénéré le songwriting et la production de Jason Lytle, ce disque sera une cruelle désillusion: on navigue en permanence entre le quelconque et le mauvais (voire le TRES mauvais: ""It's the weekend"", qu'est-ce que c'est que cette horreur?).. Mélodies gnangnan, textes larmoyants, arrangements sans saveur. Qu'il est loin, le temps de Sophtware Slump. The Commuter est un (tout juste) honnête disque de variété, mais on pouvait attendre mieux de Jason Lytle. Une citation de ""Brand New Sun"" pour terminer, résumant mon sentiment: ""Damn.. How did it get so bad ? With all the dreams we had?"". Jason serait-il lucide, tout de même ?"
2,"Je m'attendais à mieux de sa part après ""Le pont Mirabeau"" et ""J'ai oublié"" que j'aime tout particulièrement. Beaucoup de reprises même si elles sont en duo. Franchement décue ..."
4,au coin d'un feu de cheminée. A tête reposée. Une révélation.
1,"voilà un album parfaitement insipide et qui pour autant ne saurait prétendre à faciliter l'endormissement des  insomniaques tant la voix de Carla Bruni est agaçante.Elle ne chante pas,elle soupire des textes dans un anglais prononcé à la collégienne.S'enchainent 11 morceaux que rien ne distingue les uns des autres et sûrement pas les arragements musicaux au niveau de la platitude de la voix."
1,c'était original mais malheureusement c'est une redite d'autres chanteuses à petites voix perso j'aimais bien ce style mais là trop d'artistes s'engouffrent dans ce filon
1,"...C'est l'impression que donne cet album, de bout en bout. On en ressort avec un sentiment d'angoisse pénétrant, tant il semble pénible pour Rose de chanter. Les ritournelles téléphonées de poésie bobo semblent sous assistance respiratoire et le fond folk-mièvre agit comme du chloroforme.  Angoissant."
5,"Tout comme dans ""The Book of Secrets"", son précédent opus, Loreena mcKennitt nous offre un dépaysement total. Elle reste une des rares artistes à savoir communiquer via sa voix et sa musique ce qu'elle ressent lors de ses voyages. Inspiration et orchestration toujours au top, les fans ne seront pas déçus, à part peut-être par le peu de titres... On arrive trop vite à la fin d'une écoute extraordinaire au sens propre du terme!"
5,"voici le dernier album de cette artiste incomparable. Je trouve que cet artiste est à mettre aux côtés de Lisa Gerrard par sa performance vocale. En effet toutes deux utilisent leurs voix comme un véritable instrument de musique. Mais si chez Lisa Gerrard, les percutions sont relativement présentes, chez Loreena Mckennitt les mélodies s'apparentent plus à des ballades ou des des cantiques.  Ils semblerait même parfois que les instruments s'effacent volontairement et par respect tant la performance vocale est parfaite, limpide. On se laisse littéralement envouté par cette voix mélodieuse qui charme jusqu'au plus profond de nôtre être. il s'agit d'un véritable voyage musical au milieu des influences celtiques, espagnole et moyenne-orientale. Aussi bien à l'aise dans les graves que dans les aigus, elle jongle avec les notes commes si elles étaient des oeufs. Toujours justes, jamais tros forte ni trop basse, cette voix de soprano rythme notre écoute sur le pas du recueillement, du rêve et de l'émerveillement. Sans vraiment changer des albums précédents, An  Ancient Muse confirme tout le génie de cette artiste-compositeur.  En un mot PARFAIT, comme à chaque fois..."
5,"Des ""petites voix"", il y en a eu bien avant Biolay : Hardy, Birkin, etc. Ce n'est pas synonyme de médiocrité, loin de là, et cet album mérite bien mieux que deux petites étoiles. Les mélodies sont sympathiques, les textes très bien ficelés et la voix de Berry est très agréable à écouter, Da di da di da, da di dam. Les chansons sont loin de se ressembler toutes mais peut-être faut-il l'écouter davantage. En ce qui me concerne, l'album tourne en boucle sur ma platine et dans ma voiture. Merci Mademoiselle Berry pour ce moment de tendresse dans un monde de brutes."
1,"Que dire de lui? Certes, ce nouvel album reste dans la lignée du premier. Mais loin d'en être déçue, je suis ravie. Les textes sont différents, et les mélodies restent nombreuses à composer. On ne demanderait pas à Brel de se mettre au hard rock? Pourquoi vouloir que Da Silva change de monde? Ecouter ce nouvel album, c'est comme un concert qui n'en finit pas. Les choses qu'on aime, tournant en boucle."
5,"Agréable découverte par hasard! Un véritable coup de coeur! Belles mélodies, paroles poétiques!!! Un vrai bijou à découvrir d'urgence!"
5,"aprés un album solaire et rieur ""comme elle vient""sorti il y a 3 ans ,la talentueuse valentine nous revient ,dans une nouvelle maison de disques ,avec un album né à la suite de ses retrouvailles avec jay alanki,celui qui l avait façonné en 3 albums il y a deja une quinzaine d années ..aprés une 1ere ecoute un peu déconcertante ,cet album envoute littéralement ..telle une hécate moderne jil renoue avec sa part d ombre et nous distille 11 elixirs plein de malefices et de vie mélant tristesse ,apreté,ténébres,douleur,douceur,joie,lumiéres..alanski tisse la dessus des mélodies d une évidence et d une modernité inouies qu il habille de sons electro ,pop,bluesy,voire méme légérement ethniques ou ""camillesques""...et toujours cette voix d une expréssivité et d une intensité qui ne change pas ...dans cet album lunaire brillent d un eclat un peu plus intense ""de toutes petites choses""(1er extrait trés dans l air du temps),""j aime je déteste""( ballade tres caplanesque,chanson pop parfaite sur le bonheur et la douleur d aimer),""à la fenétre ""(tempo electro ,quelque chose va venir , quelque chose vien toujours....)et surtout ""un ane sur la route""(rythmique orientale qui prend aux tripes et texte d une intensité rare sur la solitude )............. ce disque ,sans concessions,et d une beauté incroyable  boulverse vraiment ...avec ou sans succés commercial,jil reste la reine de la pop francaise ..on ne peut donc dire qu une chose :merci d etre là depuis 20 ans ..........."
4,"En écoutant cet album, c'était comme si il avait lu mon journal intime et l'avais mis en musique. Mais je n'ai pas de journal intime. C'est dire combien la rime de Louis est proche de nous, de nos sentiments profonds, de nos aspirations et vagues à l'âme. La pudeur de ""Ma bonne Etoile"", le doux optimisme de ""Un ange passe"", l'infini mélancolie de ""On se retrouvera"" et la beauté sublime de ""juste une vie"". J'ai aimé tous l'album dès la première écoute."
5,"Tina Arena revient avec un nouvel album et nous suprend vraiment. Si son premier album était plus axé variété, celui-ci est beacoup plus varié : pop-rock, balades, dance, il s'agit là d'une oeuvre musicale très aboutie. La première fois que l'on écoute cet album on est un peu dérouté mais pour celui ou celle qui prend le temps de découvrir ce nouveau style, il sera agréablement surpris(e) même enchanté(e)"
1,"Faut il que certains de nos compatriotes aient les conduits auditifs déformés et formatés par des années de  et de  pour faire des stars de ce genre d'artistes et écrire -comme j'ai pu le lire sur cette page- que la miss ""avait un son trés rock""...J'ai deja parlé au sujet de   de cette énervante dénaturation du mot rock employé à tort et à travers, particulierement dans le cas présent!En fait de rock, je vous rassure sur ce point, c'est de la variété bien pompeuse et prétentieuse, parfois  , parfois  . Si toutefois dans un moment d'égarement vous avez acquit ce cd , je vous en conseille l'utilisation suivante: placé en guirlande avec   dans votre cerisier cet été, les reflets du laser sont trés efficaces pour éloigner les oiseaux, c'est déjà ca!"
2,"De belles musiques, ainsi que de belles paroles, cependant il manque une chose essentielle a cet album, c'est de la vie et une ame dans la voix de l'interprete. Je n'ai rien contre Eve Angeli, mais je trouve qu'il manque une certaine profendeur et de l'emotion dans sa facon de chanter."
2,"Je ne critique pas l'album, ce n'est moins bien ni meilleur que les autres Cabrel récents.  Par contre, la version vinyle, est une honte pure et simple : le pressage est excentré, le disque voilé (déjà échangé deux fois). La distorsion sur le canal de gauche rend l'ensemble inaudible.  C'est juste honteux."
2,"Et bien il va bien falloir se résoudre à cette idée : il n'y aura plus jamais de nouveau 'Disintégration'. La réponse vient de nous être donnée au terme de la série des 4 singles, prémonitoires de l'album à paraître le 13 octobre, qui s'appelle Dream 13 justement (!).  Pourtant, le dernier simple en date 'the perfect boy' est de loin le plus rassurant, comme sorti d'une lointaine sessions de 'Seventeen Seconds'. 'The only one' , certes pas désagréable, semble vouloir s'envoler aussi haut que 'Just Like heaven' mais rien a faire ça ne décolle pas, 'Freakshow' aurait pu faire une excellente face B pour 'The lovecats', quant à 'Sleep when i am dead', c'est simplement indigne d'un groupe comme The Cure. En 1989, le Groupe de Robert Smith déployait un son abyssal et majesteux tellement fascinant qu'il avait fédéré autour de lui des millions de fans prêts à le suivre pour l'éternité. Malgré un soubressaut à moitié rassurant 'Blodflowers' sorti en 2000 et le pâlichon 'The Cure' (2004), force est de constater que la magie n'y est plus et les choix artistiques de Robery Smith (suppression des claviers, très importants dans le son athmosphérique du groupe), difficiles à comprendre. Le retour du vibrillonnant guitariste Porl Thompson , telle l'hirondelle de retour n'aura pas fait le printemps.  Nous verrons bien ce que nous réserve 'Dream 13'... Si son niveau tutoie celui de 'Wish', il faudra déjà s'estimer heureux !"
4,"Très attendu après un travail prolongé en studio, ce nouvel album est en effet soigneusement produit. Cela permet aux atmosphères vaporeuses et languissantes comme aux titres plus vifs de bien se démarquer. Car il y a une relative diversité de l'ensemble qui devra donc être rangé au côté de The Top, Wish ou Wild Mood Swings plutôt que de la grande trilogie des albums affichant une unité de ton (le précurseur Pornography, l'historique Disintegration, le récent  ). Ce qui demeure immuable, cest la voix de Robert Smith. Tout en s'affirmant avec densité et intensité, elle tend peut-être un peu trop vers le récitatif dans plusieurs morceaux alors que l'ingéniosité musicale de The Cure tenait pour beaucoup à la mélodie du chant, que ce soit dans un certain minimalisme des mélopées ou dans les arabesques des hits pops. Peut-être le retour de Porl Thompson et son jeu de guitare libre et survolté de la période Wish (dont quelques morceaux font la redite : The Only One, Switch) sont-ils supposés compenser ce déficit de mélodie vocale. Quelques morceaux particulièrement marquants (Underneath the Stars, Siren Song, The Hungry Ghost, Sleep When Im Dead) font finalement de 4:13 Dream un album à retenir. Mais on peut espérer que le second album issu de ces longues sessions de studio et qui suivra au printemps laisse un empreinte plus nette."
5,"De tous les disques de Cure, Disintegration est celui qui possède l'ambiance la plus irréelle, car la plus onirique. Il serait impossible de décrire toutes les sensations que l'on peut connaître en l'écoutant... On pense à des aurores boréales, des eaux miroitantes, des averses de pluie fine sur une plage de sable en hiver... Les synthés, immenséments présents dans l'album, contribuent à créer cette atmosphère venue d'ailleurs, sans compter bien sûr les mélodies envoûtantes écrites par Robert, portées par des guitares étirées et filandreuses (The same deep water as you), évoluant de la douce mélancolie nostalgique et fiévreuse (Plainsong, Closedown, Lullaby, la sublimissime Last dance, Lovesong, Untitled...) à la réelle tristesse désabusée (Pictures of you, l'excellente Fascination street, Homesick...). Une oeuvre chargée d'émotions et de sentiments, qui vous emmène ailleurs. Ou comment voyager sans sortir de chez soi. Le top 3 : 1. Last dance 2.Disintegration 3.Homesick"
5,"Tout simplement génial !!! Réception du colis, et la première surprise, c'est la taille. Il est trés grand. Ouverture du colis et émerveillement avant même l'ouverture, tant la finition de ce coffret est soignée. Ouverture du coffret et découverte des différents éléments. Commencons par le digipack: Finition soignée une fois encore. feuilleter le livret qui y ait accroché est un émerveillement a chaque page, tant pour les photos que pour les petits détails sur certaines pages au niveau des textes...  Déplions l'autre partie de ce digipack et surprise, des photos, un poster !!! Passons au DVD, Le film est trés sympa, la pochette DVD est excellente elle aussi. Passons au livret... Que dis je, le livre !!! Couverture cartonnée, photos sublimes, quelques petites perles comme la reproduction des paroles manuscrite sur certaines pages. Le contenu de l'album est tout simplement excellent aussi, mais en ce qui me concerne, ce n'est pas pour la musique que j'ai acheté le coffret... Je l'avais déja :-) Tout bon fan de U2 ayant 50€ à dépenser se doit de commander ce coffret tres tres vite !!"
1,"Si le premier album de Didier Super constituait un régal d'humour au quinzième degré, cela n'empêchait pas l'artiste d'en regretter par la suite la pauvreté musicale. Ce second volet remet sérieusement les pendules à l'heure : en remplaçant le piano pour enfant par un orchestre de musique classique, Didier comble la dernière lacune de son album et entend par là toucher un public plus âgé, ainsi que le laissent entendre les titres. Apposer une voix éraillée sur un accompagnement d'une telle finesse, il fallait vraiment s'appeler Didier Super pour en avoir l'idée. Et même si le résultat n'est évidemment pas supportable plus de 10 minutes (et encore, en faisant preuve de courage), le gag resterait incomplet si personne n'achetait le disque. En conclusion, ne cédez pas à la tentation d'acheter le premier volume, aussi meilleur soit-il, et ajoutez vous aussi un n-ième degré d'humour à la corde de l'arc de Didier en augmentant les ventes de celui-ci !"
1,"Une rave qui arrive à point nommé, pour l'été, j'appelle vraiment pas ça de l'électro à proprement parlé mais une dance réchauffée 40 fois qui s'inscrit de toute façon dans le même rang que les Fuck Me I'm Famous.  Avis plutôt subjectif de ma part certes, mais procurez vous le Troy Pierce - ""Gone Astray"" et là je peux vous dire que sa claque vraiment, ca remue les tripes."
5,"C'est bien une révolution cette réévolution qui tourne résolument le dos aux deux disques précédents rejetant en bloc l'electro d'  « Eden » et la pop orchestrale de « Corps et armes ». Ne reste donc que la guitare et les influences rock avouées depuis des lustres (le Velvet underground, les Jesus and mary chain) ce qui donne un album simple rappelant les anciens morceaux joués électriques dans le « Live Ed » et puis « Paris ailleurs ».  Tout d'abord « retour à toi » morceau d'introduction impeccable au refrain accrocheur dans la lignée de « duel au soleil »  (et plus récemment « le brasier »), suit « Réévolution » au tempo plus enlevé et à la mélodie faisant beaucoup penser au groupe « Saint Etienne », puis « l'orage » véritable hymne à la culpabilité(un de mes titres préférés),  clou de l'album, « if » meilleure chanson façon Gainsbourg depuis....des lustres, une petite merveille !!!, « les remparts » titre jumeau du morceau  « Corps et armes » (les touches de piano cristallines sublimes), « vis à vis » classique aux paroles en « ic » un peu convenues....,   « le jour et la nuit » au tempo « traine la patte », peu importe, ça repart de plus belle avec pour moi le titre le plus réussi de l'album « l'inconstant » à chanter à tue tête, « les jalousies » quelque part entre « les heures hindoues » et le « space oddity » de Bowie,  « talisman » (mon deuxième préféré) descendant direct de « rendez vous à Vedra », « les liens d'eros » ou Marianne Faithfull crée une atmosphère étrange, et « au jack au mois d'avril » finit ce disque par une note Oasis. ça paraissait difficile de rivaliser avec le chef d'oeuvre « corps et armes » et pourtant Daho y réussit grâce à une simple guitare et des compositions hors normes lorgnant vers les groupes outre manche, un vraie petit miracle de la pop !"
4,"S'il ya une chose de vraie, c'est que ce cd respecte son titre "" Désobeissance civile. On aurait d'ailleurs pu penser que cela deviendrait lassant, car il faut l'avouer le thème récurrent est la lutte contre le capitalisme. Mais Keny Arkana traite de ce thème aussi bien sur un ton virulent ( réveillez vous) qu'affectif. Ce cd respecte son objectif sous des samples bien construites. Le flow reste entrainant. Les lyrics bien qu'un peu répétitives et clichés restent intéressantes et ont le bénéfices d'appeler à une réflexion individuelle( pas assez de profondeur dans les propos, aucune proposition concrètes). En bref il vaut le coup d'etre écouté, acheté mais ne vous attendez pas à de nouvelles pistes de réflexions. Heureusement que Keny Arkana change des autres rappeurs médiatisés parlant énormément de bling bling, gangster...."
1,"Naast est un groupe français que soutiend le magazine RnF. Cela n'ai pas gage de qualité hélas rien qu'avec des titres comme ""La Fille Que J'Aime"" ou ""Coeur De Glace"" (ça se dit rock !).  De toute façon nous les Français, on y connait rien au rock !"
1,"Elie Semoun, excellent comique et créateur de sketch a ici utilisé fort maladroitement les relations qu'il a pu tisser dans le milieu du ""show-biz"" francais. Il sort ici un album composé de chansons reposant sur des jeux de mots d'une bancalité digne des confiserie des écoles primaires (c'est elle et moi -&gt; c'était l'émoi ; depuis que je ne vous voie plus -&gt; vouvoie plus...) déversée sur une musique tout aussi banale malgré ses appartenances rythmées. On ne peut reconnaître qu'une qualité a cet album... Tout comme ses skecths, il fait rire."
1,"Boite à rythme bidon, voix grotesquement suave, textes qui se veulent touchants...en fin de compte c'est bien car là il est vraiment drôle."
1,"Là dans le coup phénoméne paranormal, on a fait fort!  Appellez mulder et dépoussiérez Scully, ils ont du pain sur la planche! Non mais franchement, comment oser prétendre faire du Rock en jouant un truc pareil, un comportement définitivement ""BOBO"" pour ce ""groupe"" ( cette blague??? ). C'est définitivement le groupe qui constitue une insulte au mot ROCK quand on pense à tout ces groupes géniaux qui ont donné ses lettres de noblesse au mot ROCK franchement!!! Fan de rock et de roll en tout genre, avec ce frisbee vous vous êtes fait flouer (ou rouler!) penchez vos cages à miels sur les melvins, les thugs, second rate, Mudhonney, ce que vous voulez mais pas sur ça. Bon de toute façons ils vont vendre quoi qu'il arrive mais de grâce arrêtons ce massacre!! un groupe teenage niais et innofencif, même pour la quadra pimpante de versailles, c'est dire... Allez zou poubelle..."
1,"J'ai lu dans leur bio qu'ils etaient fans des Clash, ils ne doivent pas bien avoir ecouté les paroles ni connaitre l'histoire de ce grand groupe;en tout ca rien dans leur musique ne l'indique!Pour certains commentateurs ils font du rock, j'ai meme lu du punk..alors là je me dois de rappeler aux debutants en musique que le punk est né avec des groupes comme les Sex Pistols et Clash en Angleterre ou les Ramones aux etats Unis et que c'etait un mouvement en rebellion contre les valeurs etablies, qu'elles soient musicales,politiques ou sociales, ce qui ne me semble pas vraiment le cas d'un groupe lancé par ses passages sur des Nouvelles stars ou star ac... Plutot que des Clash,Strokes ou Libertines, Artic Monkeys ou Babyshambles, BB Brunes me semble plus relever de l'axe Kyo,Tokyo Hotel,Lorie,Nouvelle star,star ac, bref des produits bien calibrés pour adolescentes, avec dans leur cas une attitude pseudo rebelle adaptée a l'age de la cible visée.Bref, pas rock pour deux sous,mais un produit bien emballé, mais comme souvent dans ces cas là, ce bel emballage ne sert qu'a cacher la mediocrité.."
5,"Que dire de plus sinon que cette chanteuse a une voix en or? un album exceptionnel, à la fois original et tout a fait hors du commun?  Comment une telle voix a t elle pu mettre autant de temps à nous parvenir????c'est impossible...  on s'imprègne de chaque mélodie et de chaque chanson comme si la chanteuse était vraiment la, devant nous, à chanter rien que pour nous!Et ces mélodies qui nous restent des heures et des heures dans la tête ce CD qu'on se repasse en boucle...une pure merveille....un bijoux!  Voila comment on peut allier voix, classe et talent: qui a dit que c'était impossible? pas vous j'éspère car...si vous aviez parrié vous auriez perdu!"
5,"Alors là, complètement bluffé!!! J'avais les ""mauvais"" à priori concernant les chansonnettes avec les marionnettes et les yeux bleus, etc...et récemment je suis tombé par hasard sur des critiques très positives de cet album, de la part d'un auteur-compositeur auquel je n'avais jamais fait attention. Cet album est superbe: superbes mélodies, ambiance, beaux textes avec une voix troublante,...Le travail du son est impeccable, ainsi que l'orchestration. Un must!"
1,"Quel arnaque ce dvd !! je reste déçue. Le concert intégrant ce dvd a été filmé médiocrement. on aperçoit par moment Michel de loin, avec une bande son tout aussi médiocre aussi. Je pense qu'avec la technologie de nos jours et le prix du DVD, ils auraient pu faire un effort. Bref, je vais être objectif, ne courrez pas l'acheter, a moins que vous n'ayez pas les cd inclus aussi."
2,"Bon il est vrai qu'alicia keys nous proposait avec song in a mior un album qui sortait de ce que l'on connaissait deja du RnB,mais la,elle s'imite elle meme en nous donnant vraiment une copie de son premier album,en se reproduisant elle perd de son originialité,et de la surprise qu'avait sucité son premier cd,certes quelque titres sont assez bon,mais pour quelqun qui aurait deja trop ecouter le premier,le second produirait une overdose je pense :/"
5,"et bien tout de même, c'est étonnant ! Tant de maturité, de charme et de liberté pour un premier album, ça me rend admirative ! il tourne en boucle, je l'avoue. Là où on aurait pu craindre un album un peu ""frileux"", il semble que le jeune artiste ait su imposer sa patte. Il n'hésite pas à surprendre, à  toucher à tous les styles, à monter sa voix comme il le veut, résultat: il nous montre l'étendue de son talent. Pour un premier album c'est quasiment inespéré. Sans tomber dans le génie (bien qu'à mon avis, ""Jacques a dit"" en approche), c'est un musicien et chanteur de très haute catégorie qui s'annonce. Cet album m'enchante autant par sa voix, par les textes et par les arrangements musicaux. J'espère juste que la prochaine fois il enregistrera dans des studios anglais. Ecoutez-le, c'est vraiment remarquable (et il y en a pour tous les goûts)."
1,"Comment se laisser prendre à ces tentatives grossières de récupération tous azimuts ? Mika, gars sympathique à ce qu'il parait, est incapable de sortir le bon côté de ses multi-influences et nous sert un plat peu appétissant constitué de glam-rock incompris, de disco avarié et de sous-variété innommable. Il a beau tenté d'imiter Freddy Mercury, il n'est pour l'instant bon qu'à piailler de manière insupportable sur ses ""compositions"" informes. A éviter d'urgence...si vous le pouvez."
2,"Until now this is for sure the weakest Lady Gaga's single: the original version is quite boring nothing more than a silly pop song. Only the remix by PSB is the reason to buy this single, even if even their mix doesn't change the song in a good song. Totally to ignore the other mix. Save your money and buy something else, or just download only the PSB mix."
5,"Si vous avez aimé Depeche Mode à la fin des années 80 et adoré leur album ""Violator"", cet album vous plaira. On retrouve l'originalité des sons électroniques propre au groupe et le côté taciturne de ""Violator"". Le premier morceau est surprenant par son intro dissonante mais il cache derrière des morceaux de choix comme le merveilleux ""damaged people"" ou ""Lilian"". Si vous avez été déçu par le précédent album "" Exciter"", oubliez-le et procurez-vous ce dernier opus!!"
2,"Un Prince vieux, usé, fatigué... Parti à la pêche des sons du R'n'B ""moderne"", tout est attendu et surfait. Le seul morceau intéressant est le duo avec Tamar ""Beautiful, Loved And Blessed"".  Pour du groove, étonnant, neuf et personnel, allez plutôt chercher du côté d'Angelo, Il est ce que Prince a été, voudrait encore être mais ne sera plus : exceptionnel."
2,"Franchement, le groupe revenu au complet devait-il se fourvoyer avec Timbaland et Timberlake aux univers tellement différents ? Ca fait vraiment : je relance les ventes ! Timbaland ayant sorti lui-même un album assez bon    ne peut s'empêcher d'empiétrer sur le terrain de Duran Duran et nous imposer Timberlake lui-même ayant sorti un album assez réussi    Duran Duran commence par deux morceaux assez nuls et se fait voler la vedette par Timbaland qui ne peut s'empêcher de l'ouvrir sur les titres qu'il produit. Du coup, ses titres sont ici les plus éfficaces mais deviennent du Tilmbaland et vide Duran Duran de sa substance. L'album devient au niveau sonore incohérent et fait compil... On peut l'écouter mais pas vraiment pour Simon le Bon et sa clique... Pour revenir à la substantifique moelle de Duran Duran mieux vaut écouter l'album  inconnu"
5,"C'est un super best of qui regroupe ses plus grand tubes romantiques en espagnol: Tu fotografia, Por un beso, Mientras tanto, Tengo que decirte algo, Con los años que me quedan, Hablas de mi...et en bonus un DVD offert !!! achetez le car c'est l'un des derniers dique de la reine de la musique latine car en 2005 elle arret definitivement sa carrière...&gt;&lt;&gt;"
5,la BO du film fidèle au film ! j'ai aimé le film ; ce CD m'a plu...
1,"Poursuivant mon tour d'horizon des primés (et déprimants :)) aux récents ""NRJ Music Awards"", je me suis donc penché sur le cas du lauréat de la catégorie ""Artiste masculin international de l'année"", Enrique Iglesias, fils de Julio. Je me suis vite rendu compte qu'il proposait grosso-modo la même musique que les Robbie Williams, Justin Timberlake ou l'oublié Ricky Martin. A savoir de la variété bien consensuelle, sans originalité, avec ses ""figures imposées"" (titres pop-rock FM ou dance-pop, ballades à la guitare sèche ou au piano) et quelques rythmes latins pour rester fidèle à ses origines. Et dans son cas, en plus d'un joli minois, un look et une attitude ""rebelles"" et ""torturés"" qui plairont aux adolescentes. Et oui, nous les garçons nous avons Britney, Rihanna ou Beyoncé, pourquoi les filles n'auraient-elles pas droit elles aussi à fantasmer sur les beaux Robbie, Justin et Enrique ? :)"
5,"Quel bel album nous ont sorti les Counting Crows! L'album démarre sur les chapeaux de roues avec, probablement, le titre le plus rock de la discographie du groupe: ""1492"". Les 13 autres morceaux de l'album n'est que tubes en série mélangeant la qualité, le style et l'inspiration de 2 de leur albums en particulier: RECOVERING THE SATELLITES et HARD CANDY. Pour les connaisseurs du groupe, si vous avez aimé ces 2 albums cités vous aimerez (sans aucun doute possible) celui-ci. Pour les autres, pourquoi pas découvrir ce très bon groupe grâce à cet album?"
1,"limp bizkit est au metal ce que britney spears est a la musique!!! C'est a dire honteux et commercial!!! Cet album surf sur une mode lancee par korn et n'ajoute rien au genre!!! Les musiciens n'ont aucun talent , surtout wes borland (guitare) qui n'a aucun son et plagie la plupart de ses riffs (ex: nookie sur les red hots) ! Bref si vous voulez un vrai disque hip hop metal allez voir du cote de biohazard ou de body count"
1,"Encore une fois,Limp Bizkit décoit et Fred Durst n'essaie pas de renouveller sa musique! Il fait ici de la pop,de la dance,deu rap,tout sauf du metal ou meme de la fusion!! Je ne saurais donc recommander ce cd aux amateurs de metal bien gras ou de la fusion bien lourde mais aux fans d'Eminem certainement!"
5,"Le son de cette album est unique et original. On sent là une maturité exceptionnelle dans le groupe. Il a su faire évoluer son funky rap en affinant ses sons et a gardé son humour et la fraicheur de ses débuts. Entrainant, pas une seule faute de gout, c'est le ""Sergent Pepper"" des Red Hot."
1,"Deux mots : l'album n'est qu'un album de plus parmi la vague new wave anglaise. Meme instrumentation, meme mélodies. C'est une pâle copie des Beatles, en 1000 fois moins bon. Aucun intérêt musical, rien d'extraordinaire. Si c'était un livre, ce serait de la bibliothèque rose : facile à lire et inutile pour qui aime la lecture."
5,"Qui ferait une anthologie de Depeche Mode serait obligé de commencer par Violator, LA référence en la matière.  Si vous ne deviez en possédez qu'un seul, ou n'en écouter qu'un pour vous faire une idée, ce serait cet album frolant la perfection."
5,"Très bel album, avec de belles compositions. Incontournable pour tous fans de Springsteen! Enregistrement sur le vif qui donne de la spontanéïté à ces oeuvres!"
2,"Ben voilà, une anthology qui tombe à pic pour les fêtes, et qui tente de retracer tant bien que mal, la carrière d'un diplodocus des années 70-80. Que reste-t-il de nos amours pour ces british sympas, moins prétentieux que Genesis, peut-être moins talentueux que Yes, mais plus accessibles ?? Ben voilà, pas grand chose. Et curieusement c'est encore plus flagrant sur une compile sans unité, que sur leurs trois ou quatre joyaux qui restent à peu près audibles e bout en bout. Le choix !!!(encore une fois...) : Soap Box Opera, Hyde in your shell, Babaji, Just another nervous wreck, Fool's ouverture ... à la trappe, mais on n'oublie pas les dernières productions insipides, et indignes de leurs prédécesseurs (après Breakfast in America). Bizarre tout çà ! Le seul intérêt de cette compile qui se veut anthologique est peut-être de faire redécouvrir les premiers morceaux plus rock, et qui n'avaient pas encore grand chose à voir avec la prog-pop qui a envahi les radios et remplit les stades en 1980. Mais je ne suis pas sûr que même les aficionados y trouvent leur compte, quand aux nouvelles générations qui ont déjà un tel apriori vu la médiocrité de leurs dernières productions ..."
5,la premiere et la deuxieme chansons m'en fait specialement craqué et j'arrete pas de les faire repeter....bref c'est une musique bien travailleé. merci mark.
5,"Avec les meilleurs musiciens de la planète (Petrucci, Portnoy, Rudess et Levin), ce groupe nous fait le bonheur de nous livrer à chacun de ses albums, des monuments musicaux. C'est super technique, avec un son génial et des musiciens au top de leur forme. Pour tous ceux qui sont fan de Dream Theater, du rock-hard progressif et des musiques instrumentales ! Un album,(tout comme le Ier) I-N-D-I-S-P-E-N-S-A-B-L-E !!!!!"
2,"Avec Riot Act je pensais que PJ avait atteint des sommets dans la médiocrité, mais là on enfonce le clou, aucune unité sur cette album, un enchainement de titres sans aucun intérêt, certains morceaux ressemblent à de très mauvais morceaux des Ramones, d'autres à des chutes de la BO d'into the wild qui n'ont rien à faire sur une galette de PJ. Bref c'est un ratage complet."
5,"qui oserait dire que cet album n'est pas une pure merveille!!!!!!!!!il viens tout droit du coeur c'est clair je pensais que seul renaud et son mistral gagnant pouvait me faire pleurer mais en fait j'ai quand même versé des larmes de tristesse avec "" tout va bien "" et ""comme un fils"" a la la MERCI CORNEILLE t'es génial"
2,"Dwele fait partie de ses nouveaux artistes surfant sur la vague neo-soul. Assurément le bonhomme a de la voix, a le flow mais ne tient pas la route dans un rôle de nouveau d'Angelo qu'il tente de s'attribuer. L'ensemble manque de saveur et seul le hit soul/funk ""Find a way"" sauve cet album, ce qui constitue un paradoxe évident pour un artiste que l'on compare trop facilement à Bilal. En somme, un LP mi-figue/mi-raisin qui nous laisse sur notre faim. Mais il s'écoute. Un artiste néanmoins en devenir."
4,"Sting nous gratifie là d'un bel album aux accents jazzy. On y retrouve le meilleur de sa période Police et quelques tubes de sa période solo. Une ambiance un peu sombre (peut être due à la date d'enregistrement: 11 septembre 2001...) Attention, si vous avez l'habitude d'écouter vos CD audio sur votre ordinateur: l'éditeur a jugé utile de rendre les 3 dernières pistes inaudibles sur un lecteur de CD-ROM (sans doute pour éviter la conversion en MP3), sans que l'étiquette ne prévienne l'acheteur. Heureusement les exemplaires les plus récents sont écoutables dans leur totalité sur un PC."
1,"Quelle déception ! Ne connaissant pas ce groupe il y a peu de temps, et beaucoup de monde me l'ayant recommandé, je me récipite sur Coldplay ... Mais malheureusement on est bien loin de la voix de Tom Yorke, bien loin de l'inventivité géniale de Radiohead, bien loin aussi de la voix fantastique de Muse ( j'ai oublié le nom du chanteur - ), et on se perd dans des mélodies vues et revues sans la moindre originalité. Quand à la voix, elle est juste sympathique, pas de quoi insister sur ce point. Je trouve ce groupe presque similaire à Travis, c'est à dire banal comme tout. La pop a du plomb dans l'aile ... A quand un retour de l'originalité ?"
1,"J'ai acheté ""a rush.."" car j'avais adoré le son de ""parachutes"" que je m'étais procurée alors que Coldplay était quasiment inconnu. La comparaison est inévitable, je trouve le dernier album dénué d'émotions, tout simplement."
5,"Après 2 albums aux tendances expérimentales marqués par l’introduction  très prononcée de l’électronique dans l’univers du groupe, Radiohead revient un album que l’on attendais pas. La bande à Thom Yorke semble avoir digéré ses échappées dans le monde des machines que représentaient  Kid A et Amnesiac et nous offre un album qui s’apparente à un condensé de leur quatre derniers accouchements. Certes l’électronique est toujours bien présente, mais cette fois c’est pour mieux servir des compositions plus équilibrées et étoffer des mélodies envoûtantes.  L’album semble également marquer un retour au rock qui avait fait son succès dès débuts en témoigne des chansons comme 2+2=5, Go To Sleep,  l’excellent There There et sa géniale progression  ou encore A Wolf At The Door. Le groupe nous prouve aussi qu’il n’a pas son pareil pour composer de superbes mélodies notamment sur Sail To The Moon, A Punchup At A Wedding ou Scatterbrain magnifiquement servie par la voix de Thom qui n’a jamais été aussi belle. Dénuée de tout effet, celle-ci s’en trouve plus pure et s’harmonise parfaitement avec la musique du groupe. En résumé, Radiohead semble avoir trouvé sa maturité et délivre son album le plus abouti qui est déjà considéré comme leur chef d’œuvre."
4,"Je me souviendrai  toujours de la première que j'ai écouté les White stripes... je crois que c'était seven nation  army qui jouait à la télé. En premier, j'étais plus attiré par l'originalité de leur vidéo que leur musique.Mais c'est les écoutant qu'ils sont devenus mon groupe préféré! Ils sont minimaliste et c'est ce que j'adore... la simplicité est à son comble! Chaque albums sont se ressemblent mais sont différents. Ils ont un style  mystérieux et à la fois un peu ''bonbon''"
1,"C'est avec ce disque que ce groupe irlandais assimilé à la New-Wave est devenu mondialement célèbre : porté par ses deux tubes planétaires, le lyrique ""New Year's day"" et le politique ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" (qui égratignait au passage la répression britannique en Irlande du Nord). Il n'empêche : U2 se positionne dans la mêlée ""New-Wave"" la plus pénible qui soit (celle qui est alors emmenée par les affreux Simple Minds)et marque l'essai du culte devenu disque d'or : envolées faciles de guitares ""héroïques"", paroles mièvres et empruntées, musique lourdingue et sans aucune originalité. U2 enterre le Post-punk et entre de plein pied dans les années 80..."
1,"Quel gâchis ! après les chef d'oeuvres de Waters, Gilmour a voulu satisfaire son égo en démontrant qu'il pouvait prendre les rennes de Pink Floyd. Bien sur, commercialement il a réussi, il a en fait trouvé assez de talent pour produire un fac similé de Pink Floyd et abuser ainsi des millions de fans béats. Quelle hérésie !!! Ecoutons plutôt Radio Kaos de Waters sorti à la même époque, la créativité est bien là."
4,"Pour apprecier correctement Mike Oldfield, il faut avoir écouté Mike Oldfield sous toutes ces facettes. Cet album, parmis ses meilleurs donc, est particulièrement brillant, puisqu'il est à mon humble avis l'un des premiers à avoir débarrassé la Musique Progressive de tous ses aspects expérimentaux les plus insupportables. Ici, point de solo de biniou de 45 mn, pas de plage psychédéliques sans fin, de solo de triangle aux effets sonores ""canabissiens"", ou de vociférations orgasmique (il y a un temps pour tout,j'ai aimé cela aussi). Ce disque aux compositions rigoureuses et curieusement simples et fluides, à la prise de sons impeccable (on peut comparer d'autres enregistrements de la même époque...)est, bien que toujours habité d'instruments accoustiques et à vent venus de nulle part chers à Oldfield, d'une incroyable modernité. On frise parfois, le Jazz-Rock, le folk ou la Pop. Des morceaux vivants et, c'est le propre de toute musique progressive réussie, en perpetuel mouvement. A noter que Mike Oldfield introduit pour la premiere fois la notion de Voix (Maggie Reilly) comme instrument à part entiere,  on peux ne pas aimer... Non réflexion faite, on ne peux pas."
2,"Redondant et ennuyeux surtout après le magnifique ""Remember that night"" et sa foule de guest stars et bonus (dont David Bowie). L'orchestre n'apporte pas grand chose. Si vous êtes fan hardcore vous pouvez vous ruer sur Gdansk. Si vous préférez n'en avoir qu'un préférez ""Remember That Night""."
5,"""Angora sois la soie, sois encore à moi"" : telle est la dernière phrase que dit Bashung dans la magnifique 'Angora'. Rien que pour cette phrase et c'est peu, on devrait se procurer ce chef d'oeuvre. Une seule phrase de la poésie de Alain et Jean Fauque peut envouter l'écouteur. C'est comme cette enveloppe sonore qui plane le long des 4 minutes de 'Aucun Express' : une des plus belles musique écrite par l'ami depuis des lustres ! -Chatterton- annonçait -Fantaisie Militaire- qui de -Fantaisie Militaire- va donner -L'Imprudence-.  Durant les 50 minutes de ce disque, on découvre 'Malaxe', sublime ouverture. 'La nuit je mens', un joyau venu du ciel qui est d'ailleurs un grand tube. L'interprétation est grandiose, la musique émouvante, écoutez ces violons et cette guitare acoustique qui couvre presque la voix rauque et enchantée de Alain. On continu avec l'électrique 'Fantaisie Militaire' qui est un véritable morceau de bravoure avec cette petite pointe de folie qui donne de la chaleur à l'interprétation du chanteur. S'en suit des perles comme '2043', la sublime 'Mes prisons' et 'Ode à la vie' comme si Bashung attaqué les genres à la fourche qu'il mani de façon innatendue. 'Dehors' avec ses nappes de cordes et le méprisant 'Samuel Hall' : pendant 5 minutes ça bouge pas, toujours le même rythme. Ca peut être fatiguant et énivrant mais c'est là le charme ! L'énivrance c'est ce qu'il y a de plus beau.  Comme si Alain Bashung en pinçé pour la musique moderne, il fait une approche aux nouvelles tendances ""trip Hop"" (c'est comme ça que ça se dit) avec 'Au Pavillon des Lauriers' où l'imprudent se dit ""Je veux rester fou"". Tu le seras toujours, mais dans le sens artistique. Comme si le bonheur ne suffisait pas, 'Sommes-nous' installe un point très précis : ""la fin de l'album"".  L'album se termine trop bien... On en redemande : ""Angora soit la soie, soit encore à moi"""
2,"On est bien loin de la simplicité et de l'innocence des deux premiers albums. Ici, les arrangements sont lourds, pour ne pas dire pompeux, les structures complexes et le son trop parfait. Mêmes les textes se voulant engagés, en deviennent maladroits (Iron hand sur On every street est à mon sens, l'une des meilleures protest song de Dire Straits) et s'éloignent des univers un peu abstraits qui faisaient le charme de Lions, Follow me home et autres News. Sincèrement, j'adorais cet album jusqu'au jour où j'ai découvert Bruce Springsteen. Cet album ne m'a semlé alors qu'un misérable ersatz ; 85% de son contenu a été influencé apporté par le Boss et son E Street Band. D'ailleurs, Roy Bittan du E Street Band avait déjà travaillé avec Dire Straits. Depuis, cet album me paraît fade et présente peu d'intérêts : la dernière participation au groupe du subtile et swinguant batteur Pick Withers, les parties de marimba et les parties de piano d'Alan Clark. Franchement, si vous avez aimé les deux (voire les trois) premiers albums de DS, si vous aimez les riffs simples mais efficaces, les mélodies qui ont du peps et une énergie des débuts du groupe, alors foncez sur le LP Twisting by the pool, sorti en même temps que Love over gold, où l'on retrouve cette pêche rock'n'roll qui fait tellement défaut à cet album, comme si le groupe avait du contrer une certaine frustration dans ce pseudo concept album. Et encore, on y a échappé belle car à l'époque, Knopfler voulait sortir un double et ce sont John Illsey et Vertigo qui y ont mis le frein ! En résumé, Love over gold est un bon album mais un mauvais Dire Straits."
2,"Le plus incroyable avec ce Greatest Hits, c'est qu'aucun membre des Gn'R n'a eu le moindre droit de regard dessus. Geffen (racheté par Universal) sort donc cette compilation bien creuse sans même l'accord du groupe, juste pour faire rentrer la money. La sélection des titres pour ce best-of est très discutable, on compte quand même 5 reprises sur un disque censé résumer l'oeuvre du groupe ! Aucun bonus, aucun inédit, quelle tristesse... Tournez vous plutot vers les albums originaux, là au moins vous ne serez pas déçu."
5,"pour moi c'est leur meilleur album, de nombreux morceaux excellents et créatifs, et un peu plus de sensualité que dans leur autres ouvrages."
2,"Cet album aurait pu être intéressant dans sa démarche novatrice. Cependant, les saturations incessantes empêchent d'être satisfait. Il s'ensuit une lassitude de l'écoute. Dommage"
5,"Après avoir entendu beaucoup de bien de ce groupe (qui en fait est l'oeuvre de Nicolas Chapel), je ne m'attendai pas à écouter avec délice un tel chef d'oeuvre.  Tout est réussi dans cet album : production trés soignée; arrangements sophistiqués; guitare tantôt cristalline, aérienne, accoustique, planante ou saturée; voix envoutante; compositions et mélodies variées, surprenantes, fascinantes, touchantes; paroles intriguantes, pochette singulière.  9 titres d'une absolue beauté.  Nous avons l'impression d'être en présence du croisement de PORCUPINE TREE et d'ANATHEMA pour le meilleur des deux. Chapeau bas."
2,"Eh bien, 3 écoutes ne m'ont pas convaincu. Ce n'est pas assez, je sais bien, un album d'Interpol se savoure sur la durée mais il y a quelque chose de cassé, est-ce la production de Rich Costey, trop lisse (pourquoi avoir quitté le fantastique Peter Katis ?), ou est-ce cette lassitude à entendre toujours les mêmes motifs mélodiques, et ces arpèges de guitares moins inspirés ? Lassant, voilà le mot. Oh bien sûr, individuellement, les gars restent des as dans leurs disciplines respectives, tout ça sonne carré, pro, puissant. Mais la flamme de ""Turn on the bright lights"", encore brillante sur ""Antics"", semble éteinte cette fois. La pochette est magnifique, c'est déjà ça..."
2,un album tel que Tilt de scott walker défit l'entendement. un mélange de musique de chambre avec les infra-basses de trent reznor. comment un crooner brelien en vient à sortir un album sous haute influence d'Alan vega?? Christophe cherche toujours.
5,"je ne connaissais pas Taj Mahal mais par contre je connaissais son guitariste indien Jesse Ed Davis qui participera plus tard aux cd de John Trudell, voila la raison de mon achat et je n'ai pas du tout été déçu...!!! en plus à ce prix là..."
4,"Reçu très rapidement, dommage que ce ne fut pas précisé que la version vendue était ""LIVE""."
1,"Mike Oldfield est un musicien inspiré, multi-instrumentiste surdoué qui a commis quelques albums géniaux que l'on peut s'amuser à décortiquer ainsi : souvent chez cet artiste chaque morceaux est conçu comme une œuvre de type ""classique"". Succession de mouvement lents, rapide, calme, mélodiques, rythmiques...etc. Un thème principal qui se nourri peu à peu de cordes, d'instruments à vent, de sonorités folk, de percussions ethniques, d'ambiances baroques, de sons électriques ou de voix, pour enfler et enfler jusqu'à l'éclatement et renaitre à nouveau sur un thème différent. Un mécanisme assez fréquent dans la musique dite ""progressive"". Et tout ses premiers albums sont ainsi construits (de Tubular Bells à Tubular bells II, en passant par Ommadawn, Five Miles Out, QE2, Crises et Discovery). Mike oldfield continue de faire des albums que je me permet de qualifier de mauvais alors que je suis fan absolu des albums pré-cités. Il espère sans doute que personne ne s'aperçoive qu'il use et abuse des sempiternelles mêmes recettes jusqu'à l'écœurement. Et remplacer les guitares par des sonorités synthétiques plus immondes les unes que les autres n'y changera rien (quel guitariste pourtant !!!). Cette énième tentative de renaissance en nous proposant cet album soi-disant de ""musique classique"" ne prends pas, parce-que M.O. n'est PAS un musicien classique (quelle prétention, Mike !!). A 17 ans, composer Tubular bells est exceptionnel. Nous proposer aujourd'hui ce ""Claydermanesque"" album donne juste envie de lui dire : arrête, pour l'amour de Dieu, arrête, on t'aime."
2,"Comme il a déjà été mentionné précédemment, il n'y a aucune nouveauté dans ce troisième album de Era : trop nombreux sont les titres remixés des précédents albums, et j'ai plus eu l'impression d'avoir acheté une compil qu'un nouvel album, j'ai donc été très déçue. Deux étoiles quand même puisqu'il y a néanmoins quelques inédits dans cet album."
5,"Genesis est le groupe qui m'a fait entrer dans le rock.  J'avais 15 ans, l'air du temps était punk, et moi je bassinais mes copains avec Genesis.  Avec le temps mes goûts sont devenus très éclectiques (de U2 à Tom Waits en passant par la chanson française), et j'ai un peu délaissé le progressif. J'ai redécouvert tout récemment Foxtrot, et tout est là, intact : la musicalité, la voix du Gab, les compositions complexes tout en restant accessibles, toujours un délice. Cela a beaucoup moins vieilli que pas mal de choses plus récentes."
4,"Ce n'est pas le meilleur Cohen, mais après ""Songs of love and hate"", peut-il y avoir mieux (il y aura bien ""Various Positions""...)? Cependant, des chansons comme ""Lover, lover, lover"" ou ""Who by fire?"" sont indispensables à connaître, tout comme ""A Poet must die""."
2,"Ce disque n'est pas mauvais en soi mais il ne peut être que décevant pour ceux qui aimaient se plonger dans l'univers sombre des premiers albums. Les arrangements bénéficient d'une excellente production mais ce nouveau son pop-rock manque cruellement d'originalité en comparaison de la créativité des délires synthétiques des opus précédents. La subtilité des textes d'antan est troquée contre des jeux de mots lourds et une émotion feinte. L'image de la star sexy sous le soleil de la Californie est en totale contradiction avec celle de l'héroïne romantique qui l'a rendue célèbre. C'est pourquoi, à la sortie de l'album, beaucoup de fans de la première heure ont déserté les rangs..."
5,"Mademoiselle Farmer paraissait sur de parfaits rails après ""Innamoramento"", son grand chef-d'oeuvre aux dires de certains (mais pas son meilleur album, désolé...). Et puis voilà, il semblerait qu'elle ne choisisse pas la voie de la facilité, c'est-à-dire une suite logique de son cinquième opus, ce à quoi beaucoup s'attendaient, il faut bien le dire. Et c'est tant mieux ! Mylène a son style et a su le renouveler sans le perdre durant vingt-cinq ans (au contraire de certaines chanteuses internationales que je ne nommerai pas), et elle sait évoluer. Il fallait surtout éviter de refaire la même chose, ce que je reproche un peu (bien qu'un tout petit peu) à ""L'Autre..."", et le pari est gagnant ! Les évanescentes musiques de Boutonnat (un véritable génie de la composition, pas besoin d'aller voir William Orbit ou Timbaland...), la voix à la fois magnifique et maîtrisée de mademoiselle Gautier, des textes personnels et variés, un chef-d'oeuvre absolu niveau tracklist (""Avant que l'ombre..."") et surtout une mâturité qu'on était en bon droit d'attendre après des années d'errances spirituelles et affectives. Mylène est la seule chanteuse au monde qui ait du succès et fasse un album aussi merveilleux après vingt et un an de carrière et avec une plume aussi talentueuse (n'en déplaisent à ceux qui la critiquent pour son côté dictionnaire : heureusement qu'elle s'en sert et nous ne ressert pas toujours les phrases bateau auxquelles trop ""d'artistes"" nous ont habitués) et des références culturelles toujours plus fines et nombreuses, mais toujours pertinentes, bien insérées et indécelables à la première écoute. A l'évidence, pas un album pour une oreille fatiguée ou paresseuse, mais son plus grand chef-d'oeuvre (au moins pour le moment)."
1,"Il aura fallu tant de temps pour accoucher de cette compilation de niaiseries et de bouillie pour chat ! Pauvre petite Alizée, il va falloir penser à autre chose, peut-être changer de compositeurs... On préferrait largement la petite Lolita. Maintenant, plus rien ! Sniff"
5,"Avant la sortie de ce premier album était sorti un single, Fall out. Un producteur avisé avait donné comme consigne à Sting de braire comme un âne (On sort à peine du punk) ! Il lui arrive encore de pousser sa voix sur ce premier album (Next to you, Truth hits everybody et même RROOAA...XANE) comme il ne le fera plus jamais par la suite (Surtout pas maintenant qu'il revisite les tubes de la Renaissance, accompagné au luth, on croit rêver !). Un album plus rock que les suivants, donc. Des tubes (on les connaît), des curiosités (Peanuts, Masoko Tanga), un monologue (Sally, curieuse histoire de poupée gonflable) et une seule erreur de casting, l'insupportable Born in the fifties (rythmique lourdingue et Sting beuglant comme un veau), que l'on pardonnera volontiers tant l'ensemble vaut le détour. Pour l'anecdote, je m'étais longtemps demandé pourquoi on entendait un rire au début de Roxanne (dont le sujet n'est guère hilarant). J'ai lu récemment que Sting s'était assis malencontreusement sur le clavier d'un piano (on entend nettement l'accord fessier), d'où son hilarité."
2,"Des Picards hélas en manque(que nous espérons tous temporaire) de matériel exploitable. Si quelques titres de l'album passent agréablement à l'écoute(Lady Diana, Chinese Démocracy), on ne peut s'empêcher de penser qu'ils nous rappellent inévitablement un de leurs mémorables morceaux précédents (mêmes rythmes et type de mélodie). Ce manque de chansons exploitables est en effet encore plus mis en avant à travers les 2 réarrangements de leur précédent album, Pamplemousse mécanique. Bref, un retour en studio prématuré, un album qui n'est pas à la hauteur de leur talent d'écriture; car ils en ont beaucoup et on les aime pour cela !"
2,"Il était conquérant, et avec cet album, il ne devient qu'un simple soldat de la musique électro. Ce disque contient quelques bons moments (les mouvements II, III et IV), mais c'est un manque d'inspiration flagrant qui caractérise ce disque. Mention spéciale à Patrick Rondat, guitariste français et homme délicieux (j'ai eu la chance de pouvoir m'entretenir avec lui durant 45 minutes, c'est un vrai gentleman), qui réhausse le mouvement III de sa présence."
2,"Alors que Budha Bar 1 était une véritable merveille dans son ensemble, Buddha Bar 2 pourtant toujours compilé par Claude Challe s'avère très décevant. Les morceaux, aussi bien de la partie 'dinner' que 'party'sont d'une qualité parfois passable.La magie du 1ère opus s'est malheureusement évaporée. Ravin a t-il réussi à remonter le niveau avec BB3 ?"
1,"pas de disque plus surévalué que celui-ci,,,,, pour moi c'est de la musique d'ascenseur et encore à condition de ne pas monter dans une tour trop haute sinon on risque la gerbe ! Veuillez, je vous prie, écouter plutôt le grand Petrucciani ou Joachim Kühn ou Mc Coy Tiner ou... il en manque pas d'autres........"
1,"Oscar de la plus mauvaise prise de son.les pianissimo sont à la limite de l'audible et les fortissimo complètement saturés. Disques inécoutables en voiture et sur une chaine Hi-Fi il faut garder le doigt en permanence sur la télécommande. Grand dommage car l'interprétation est magnifique.J'ai du passer par Adobe audition et tout renormaliser et regraver les disques pour pouvoir les écouter . Et pourtant c'est le label Deutch Gramophon, tout se perd...."
5,"j ai decouvert cet album en decembre 2006 , grace au livre de Philippe Robert que je remercie au passage .  Depuis plusieurs jours ce musicien que je ne connaissais que de nom me fascine litéralement.   Je suis completement bouleversé par cet album , un disque tres soul  pour les premiers morceaux , dont   une version de bird on a wire qui peut rappeler otis reding  parfois  avec un final sublime , tout comme cet  album bourré de surprises et puis quelle voix , quelle voix ."
1,"Cette interprétation est froide et souffre de nombreuses lacunes. Si l'opus 90 manque déjà d'envergure, l'opus 142 apparaît bien plus décevant encore. Le pianiste semble incapable de faire ressortir la mélodie, de la faire chanter et de lui insufler de la vie (n°3 en si b majeur!) et les tentatives d'expressivité ne sont que des effets superficiels, à savoir frapper vainement les touches du clavier (n°4 en fa mineur). Une version plus qu'inintéressante, surtout si on s'aventure à la comparer à celles, légendaires, de Schnabel et de Fischer."
5,"11 ans déjà depuis le dernier album ! On n'osait même plus ésperer un nouvel album. Et voila que se pointe le 3ème opus de Portishead. On avait même une petite crainte : est ce que ce sera toujours aussi bon ? est ce que j'apprécierai toujours autant malgré le temps écoulé ? Et la réponse dans les deux cas est un énorme OUI ! Leur musique a évolué (et c'est tant mieux : il est loin le temps du trip hop 90's) mais la marque de fabrique Portishead est là et bien là. La voix de Beth Gibbons est toujours aussi déchirante, l'atmosphère, plus rock et plus électro à la fois est immédiatement reconnaissable. Tous les titres sont bons, certains surprennent ('Deep Water' au Ukulélé, 'Machine gun' et sa rythmique martiale et un peu effrayante) d'autres sont absolument bluffants ('small' : il y a bien longtemps que je n'avais pas entendu un morceau aussi bien construit...) Bref : si vous êtiez fan de portishead à l'époque (et que vous n'avez pas encore acheté cet album...) FONCEZ !!!"
5,"L'immense succès de cet album est totalement justifié. Kylie prouve une fois de plus qu'elle est la meilleure au monde; son arrivée dans le domaine de l'électro est pleinement réussie. ""Can't get you out of my head"" et ""Love at first sight"" sont des tubes d'exception que l'on peut écouter en boucle sans se lasser. ""In your eyes"" une petite merveille électro et ""Come into my world"", légèrement en retrait, reste d'un très bon niveau. Mais il n'y a pas que les singles: ""Dancefloor"" et ""Give it to me"" sont 2 morceaux très entraînants, ""More, More, More"" est une superbe performance vocale, ""Burning up"" est assez spécial mais très sympathique, ""Fever"" un bon titre sans être génial. En tout 8 morceaux de très grande qualité, 1 de bonne qualité, et 3 chansons lentes pour compléter. Pas mes préférées, mais il y en a qui aiment... Au total, ""Fever"" est un album particulièrement réussi, dont 8 titres étaient des singles potentiels, ce qui est très rare."
5,"Découverte par hasard, à force de voir sa frimousse partout, la curiosité m'a emportée et fais acheter ce disque... et je ne le regrette pas du tout! Un premier album fais uniquement de reprise de grand classique de la soul enregistré avec de grands musiciens... une pure merveille... Joss vous étonnera et ce encore plus si vous ne savez pas de suite à quoi elle ressemble (ceux qui le savent déjà vous pouvez lire plus bas ;-) )"
1,"Avant toutes choses, mettons les choses au point: 1) Oui j'aime la disco et la dance... et non, je n'ai pas honte de ça! 2) Oui Bob Sinclar a prouvé qu'il savait concocter de délicieux grooves au long d'albums bien sympas comme Champs-Elysées ou Paradise et je considère ""Kiss my Eyes"" de l'album III, un must. 3) Oui je serai toujours reconnaissant à Sinclar d'avoir redoré le blason de Cerrone, qui, dans les années 1970, a produit 4 albums classiques de la disco dont le superbe Supernature... 4) Oui tout allait très bien dans le monde musical de Sinclar jusqu'à ce que ""World, hold on"" de Western Dream (par ailleurs, un bon CD) devienne un tube planétaire et qu'il se rende compte qu'on peut faire beaucoup de succès en mélangeant rythme dance avec percus ethniques, chant avec raggamuffin et préchi précha écolo/droits de l'homme, très à la mode de nos jours.  Maintenant Sinclar revient avec son nouveau produit: La soupe dance instantanée. Les ingrédients sont simples: beats dance, rythmiques exotiques, chants ragga avec choeurs pour faire joli et samples de tout ce qui nous tombe sous la main, depuis Rappers Delight, jusqu'à Manu Chao, en passant même (et sans aucune honte) par l'ineffable Lambada! Le summum du non-sense est atteint avec la reprise (lounge?) de Mr Tambourine Man qui ne manquera pas de figurer sur la prochaine compil Costes de Pompougnac. Il y en aura surement beaucoup qui se délecteront avec ce breuvage, mais personnellement mon goût pour la junk food est extrêmement limité. Mr Sinclar retournez vite à vos fourneaux et préparez-nous quelque chose de plus consistant!"
5,"Cet album est génial et riche.Il montre un Ja rule détérminée dans sa musique et dans ses lyrics;il suit à la lettre son idole 2 Pac.Ses featurings avec Nas,2 Pac et même Bobby Brown nous plonge dans un amerique plein d'espoir et de rêve.""The last tentation"" montre le vrai visage de notre Ja rule adoré!"
1,Ca ressemble vaguement à un mélange entre un le pire album des Rubettes et un mauvais concert de Jean-Michel Jarre. Un album complètement surévalué. Ca devrait être la musique d'ambiance préférée de votre supermarché ces 15 prochains jours.
4,"cette espèce de pincement au coeur qui nous transporte ailleurs, une bouffée d'émotion, c'est ce que l'on ressent dès que les premières notes du disque nous parviennent aux oreilles, car si cette histoire est quelquefois sanglante, elle est avant tout épique et extraordinairement émouvante, tout comme la musique qui l'accompagne, envoutante, mais aussi apaisante, rarement une musique aura su ainsi combiner les sentiments de force et sérénité."
5,"Avant la sortie de BATMAN, on ne connaissait encore de Danny Elfman que son esprit génialement déjanté (PEE WEE BIG ADVENTURE) ou irrésistiblement macabre et loufoque (BEETLEJUICE), et voilà que le projet le plus ambitieux de sa carrière se présentait déjà : une grosse machine hollywoodienne avec laquelle il pourrait définitivement asseoir son nom au rang des plus grands compositeurs américains. Non seulement BATMAN devait être une grosse production (gros budget, gros casting), mais dirigé par un cinéaste des plus atypiques d'Hollywood, Tim Burton, il était également destiné à devenir le film mythique que l'on sait. Danny Elfman s'en est donc donné à cœur joie : le film ouvre sur un des thèmes les plus impressionnants du cinéma, paradoxalement sombre et flamboyant et d'une efficacité indéniable, dans lequel il a mis à profit son influence hermannesque, et a délivré ainsi une musique à la fois magistralement ténébreuse et d'un souffle épique digne des meilleures adaptations musicales des héros de BD (Superman de John Williams). La description de ce thème à elle seule, résume l'impression générale qui se dégage de l'ensemble de cette partition majestueuse.  Le tonitruant First Confrontation illustrant l'épisode de l'usine de déchets toxiques, nous présente un thème vraiment accrocheur qui fonctionne sur un ostinato qui revient avec ténacité comme un règlement de comte, et qui revient une seconde fois dans le film, non présente sur le disque.   Batman to the Rescue et tout ce qu'il comporte d'épique et de trépidant (la première course poursuite en Batmobile) est évidemment un des morceaux les plus héroïquement jubilatoires (avec une excellente première partie, lorsque le héros masqué traverse le dôme de verre du musée d'Art pour sauver Vicky Vale, encore une fois déplorablement absente du disque).  De même que tout le final du film qui va de Attack of the Batwing (un morceau qui colle de très près à l'action excitante de l'engin volant, et de sa célèbre apparition face à la Lune le temps d'un glorieux et poétique instant) en passant par Up The Cathedral (une ascension musicale aux résonances assurément gothiques) jusqu'à The Final Confrontation dédié à l'ultime effort et à la bravoure du super héros, et tout en privilégiant des passages cyniquement drôles dus à la présence délirante de Jack «Joker» Nicholson (Waltz to the Death est une preuve irréfutable de cette délicieuse ironie macabre planant sur le film et sa partition et qui se retrouve avec un plaisir irrésistible dans des morceaux comme Photos/Beautiful Dreamer et Joker's Poem). Il faut également souligner tout le travail musical sentimental de la partition, avec les morceaux comme Childhood Remembered dans lesquels Danny Elfman fait preuve d'une sensibilité jusqu'ici assez rare (quoique pas encore aussi convaincante que celle d'EDWARD SCISSORHANDS). Forcément, BATMAN ne serait pas la partition inoubliable que l'on connaît sans le superbe thème de la Batmobile que l'on peut entendre à deux reprises, isolément géniales : Descent into Mystery, avec ses chœurs mystiques et la pression orchestrale phénoménale qui est dégagée lors de cette inoubliable voyage vers la Batcave, et Charge of the Batmobile, un morceau qui commence majestueusement avec le thème de Batman et enchaîne avec brio sur le thème, toujours aussi remarquablement époustouflant, lié à la Batmobile, lors de l'assaut de celle-ci dans une séquence pour le moins explosive à l'écran comme à l'écoute. Enfin et heureusement, Danny Elfman ne nous épargne pas l'apothéose hollywoodienne traditionnelle dans un pareil cas, avec un Finale triomphant qui congratule de toute sa puissance orchestrale la victoire du super héros en transcendant vers des accords toujours plus hauts le retentissant thème de Batman avec un plan final inoubliable, montrant le sombre héros cape au vent lançant son regard du plus haut d'un gratte-ciel vers son signe d'appel... Glorieuse conclusion qui ne manque pas de s'enchaîner avec des End Credits énergiques dédiés, bien sûr, à la victoire et à la perpétuation de la légende de l'homme chauve-souris. Un illustre exercice de style hollywoodien, donc, pour le très talentueux Danny Elfman qui signe une partition majeure dans sa carrière et lègue au mythe de Batman une identité musicale très certainement indélébile..."
1,"comment peut on raisonnablement mettre 5 étoiles à ce groupe prétentieux qui n'amène rien de nouveau et qui à coup sûr decevra son public dans 2 ou 3 albums (comme toutes les nouvelles sensations rock qu'on nous présente depuis the strokes).Le rendez vous est pris. En attendant pas de quoi se pâmer devant cet éventails de vieilles ficelles  entendu et réentendu ailleurs en d'autres temps (mais en mieux). Qui ne connait pas le passé, ne peut pas juger le présent. Je leur souhaite bon courage(ils en auront besoin)."
1,"programme alléchant, gros renfort de presse ""spécialisée et non"" (de toutes façons ce sont les mêmes qui écrivent dans les deux...), music black, Motown, et Stax dans le viseur, le côté mâle de Winehouse, voire la place bientôt vacante pour raison de santé....., émission live de chez nous (""Nous à RatarataRa, on adore ""... comme tout le reste d'ailleurs...). Alors bien sûr on se dit qu'il y aura forcémment quelque chose . Et bien, à mon avis, il n'y a RIEN, que du vent sur-produit qui s'efforce de faire croire qu'on est en ligne directe avec Otis, James, Temptations,et d'autres. Il n' y a aucune originalité dans ces reprises, et surtout aucune âme. C'est le genre de disques qui n'a absolument aucun intérêt (la voix me direz vous ?), ou l'on s'efforce d'être un élève appliqué, c'est tout. Le seul mérite vient du choix des chansons un peu moins convenues que d'habitude pour ce genre de disques : c'est tout."
1,"Franchement, il ne suffit pas que la presse dise ""c'est bien"" pour que ça le soit... Ce disque est d'un ennui total. Rien ne ressort de l'écoute. Aucune émotion, aucune performance... Une fois de plus, on sent du surf sur la vogue ""Old Scholl"". Ici la production veut nous la refaire à la AMY WINEHOUSE (trop tard elle l'a fait avant et en mieux !) ici il n'y a pas la magie mais l'ennui mortel... Je préfère écouter les originaux de la Stax ou la Motown... Poubelle !!!!"
5,"léger, c'est le mot qui me vient à l'esprit, lorsque j'écoute cet album. la légèreté par les temps qui courent, c'est précieux, et rare, si vous possedez déjà les albums : de lisa ekdahl et terez montcalm, alors, ajoutez- y ceux de stacey kent, initiatives salutaires..."
2,"Ce disque est la copie conforme d'un album aujourd'hui méconnu de Joao Gilberto intitulé ""Amoroso""; tout y était déjà: les chansons (Besame mucho, S'wonderful...), l'arrangeur Claus Ogerman... Mais il y avait également LA VOIX de Joao Gilberto, son phrasé, sa douceur, ses intonations malicieuses... Diana Krall s'évapore, à force de languissements; son style si admirable d'habitude semble s'enliser, elle finit par lasser et Claus Ogerman devrait prendre sa retraite tant ses arrangements tournent en rond! Un produit marketing, MOR, sans âme mais qui prétend en avoir... Dommage! Il reste les disques de Joao Gilberto, heureusement..."
1,"Contrairement à l'album précédent ""when I look in your eyes"" Diana Krall donne ici une bien piètre prestation. Un son très pauvre et une interprétation sans talent. Dommage mais cet album est à déconseiller aux fans s'ils veulent rester sur une bonne impression. On sent la machine commerciale bâtie uniquement sur la notoriété (justifiée) de Diana Krall. Espérons que les prochains seront meilleurs. Jane Monheit avec ""comme dream with me"" et lisa Ekdhal sont nettement un ton au dessus."
1,"je suis déçue de ce produit il n'y qu'un seul titre qui me satisfait, je pensais que c'étai un best of avec les meilleurs morceaux"
2,"La musique est superbissime, mais le cd très très court (moins de 30 minutes). Alors, préférez The Soul Of, qui est sans doute plus cher mais qui n'est pas une simple réeddition de l'album d'origine et qui n'a que 3 titres (sur 18) absents sur 8 Men, 4 Women. Croyez-moi, j'ai les deux cds."
4,"Encore une fois U2 n'a pas déçu l'album s'écoute vraiment facilement, C'est mélodique, c'est agréable, c'est du U2 !"
4,"Pas de boite à rythme de synthé ou de guitare hurlante pour ce jazz vocal pur jus dans la lignée des Mc Ferrin, Double six etc... Toute la place est faite à la voix, aux jeux et aux sonorités! Du peps et de la virtuosité pour ce groupe nouveau venu sur la scène du jazz vocal mais avec déjà des compositions originales et des reprises à son actif! Procurez-vous Bobby Groove album de reprise du grand Boby Lapointe, swinguées par les grandes gueules."
1,"Qu reste-t-il de nos amours ? ici le jazz est réduit à une toile de fond médiocre et insipide. La belle a une voix inexpressive et stéréotypée.   Bessie, Sarah, Carmen, Nina, Billi, Ella, Betty et Cassandra ne sont pas  de la famille de  cette pauvre petite qui ici chante mollement"
2,"Oui évidemment c'est bien fait c'est charmant et il y a toutes les notes. On sent que tout le monde joue très bien de son instrument, très bien vraiment. Mais plus personne ne prend du risque. Un grand art de la berceuse idéal pour les amnésiques."
5,"Cet album est surement un des meilleurs albums de Gainsbarre si ce n'est le meilleur. Entouré de ses musiciens anglais, son talent de compositeur est ici au sommet et les arrangements sont fabuleux. Cet album est destiné à tous les bassistes en herbe qui en auront pour des années avant d'acquérir un doigté aussi fabuleux que le bassiste anglais jouant ici. Les paroles sont elles aussi fabuleuses et on se laisse entrainer dans ce comte moderne que nous livre ici le grand Serge. A posséder absolument dans sa discothèque !!"
5,"Edition complète, comprenant 8 prises alternatives, à un prix particulièrement attractif. Le format digipack est bien adapté et le livret très complet.  Avec Giant Steps, John Coltrane pousse et use à l'extrême l'utilisation des grilles d'accords, ceux-là mêmes qu'il répétait à l'infini, dont il s'imprégnait pour découvrir leur extrême limite. Son passage, en 1957, chez Monk lui a permis d'atteindre une grande liberté : on sait que, lors des concerts, Monk aimait laisser son trio seul et aller faire un tour ou déambuler sur scène en esquissant quelques pas de danse. Coltrane jouait alors des solos dépassant parfois les vingt minutes : sa maîtrise des grilles atteignit ainsi les sommets. Le disque est donc la dernière étape de cette approche de l'accord total( avec ""Coltrane's Sound"" et ""Coltrane Jazz"", enregistrés dans la foulée). Dans ce disque, il semble que Coltrane ne pourra aller plus loin mais c'est sans compter sur sa quête insatiable qui lui fera dépasser l'indépassable. Giant Step marque également une évolution dans le son de John (lui que les critiques d'alors persistent à surnommer le jeune homme en colère). Déjà, à cette époque, il expérimentait des hanches plus dures pour gagner en puissance et travaillait sur la colonne d'air ce qui lui permettait de souffler en quasi permanence, même lors de l'inspiration. Giant Steps marque donc l'achèvement d'une période de l'histoire musicale de John, prêt pour de nouvelles aventure. IL est à la fois un point culminant et le départ vers d'autres horizons.  ""Naima"" deviendra un véritable standard du jazz, repris par exemple par Archie Shepp (""Four for Trane""), Pharoah Sanders (""Africa"" entre autre...), David Muray (""Octet plays Trane""), etc... Coltrane le jouera très souvent en concert. La mélodie en reste immortelle. Historique."
5,"Mingus revisite ses racines avec fougue et générosité. Peut-être pas le plus moderniste des disques de Mingus, certains pourront préférer ""Phitecantropus Erectus"", il reste une des plus grandes réussites du maître . Avec l' apport des merveilleux Jackie McLean et Booker Ervin aux saxophones et de l'excellent Horace Parlan au piano, l' album est une véritable cure de jouvence vers laquelle on revient sans cesse. L' énergie dégagée par cette musique est phénoménale !"
5,"david est toujours égal à lui meme. très bel album. les paroles sont touchantes émouvantes.... .la musique est superbe, tout s'accorde parfaitement, ajouter à cela sa sublime voix chaude et sensuelle, ont est au paradis sur une autre planète un autre satellite"
1,"ou sont passe les bon vieux offspring du temps d'ignition ou de smash, depuis americana on les entends sur les radio entre deux morceau de britney spears et de maria carrey... enfin, une fois ecouté deux fois leur dernier cd est vite oublie... dommage"
5,"ce CD est vraiment excellent tous les morceaux sont chantés avec émotion, les textes sonnent justes la texture de la voix de Charles Dumont donne toute l'ampleur et la puissance du texte et de la musique ce CD est une vraie réussite."
2,"cette compilation des succès de dalida en espagnol est décevante: il n'y a pas unité de voix (les chansons ont été enregistrées à différentes époques), il n'y a aucune chronologie dans l'ordre de défilement des titres, on nous recolle ""paroles, paroles"" et ""besame mucho"", ""salma""...en français, ce qui est inutile: on les a déjà 10 fois au moins! une intégrale n'était pas si compliquée à faire: ça tient en à peu près 25 titres. Enfin, il faut dire à Orlando de perdre cette manie de retoucher les portraits de Dalida:  on a peine à la reconnaître, et sur la pochette, elle a presque l'air méchante! un comble! il y a eu un CD en  espagnol pressé il y a une quinzaine d'année qui offrait plus d'intérêt."
1,"la FF c'est quoi ? C'était, car oui c'était un groupe prometteur du rap français, qui déchirait tout sur son passage sur des sons de Pone, donnant des classiques au rap français comme ""La furie &amp; la foi"", ça c'était dla bomb, maintenant sur ""Art2rue"" ya plus de trace de ce qui a fait leur succès, et depuis quand l'art de rue ça tourne en boucle sur Skyrock? (onsaiktonprénomcfrançois) moi jdis non non pour cet album que j'ai du mal à écouter jusqu'au bout (alors l'h t...) , le rap de Marseille c pas ça sinon ça me déçoit, ..."
5,"Ce nouvel album de Ben Harper est un véritable bijou. L'artiste nous offre ici un véritable voyage à travers les grandes époques de la musique. On se retrouve donc dans les années 70 avec ""She's Only Happy In The Sun"" faisant penser aux Pink Floyd ou encore les années 80 avec ""So High So Low"" avec une rythmique digne de Van Halen. On n'oubliera pas ""Bring The Funk"" et ""Brown Eyed Blues"" qu'aurais pu chanter James Brown, tout ceci en passant par l'intemporel morceau reggae ""With My Own Two Hands"". Pour les amateurs de musique douce, Harper garde ce style qui lui est particulier et nous offre de très belle balades avec ""When She Believes"", ""Blessed To Be A Witness"" (dont la majesté fait penser au Roi Lion; probablement la plus belle de l'album) et ""Picture Of Jesus"" qui est un véritable tour de force: aucun instrument, juste la voix de l'artiste accompagnée par des chants sud-africains... Cet album ira trôner sans complexes au cotés des 5 précédents. Si vous êtes fan foncez les yeux fermés."
5,"certes, ce best of est sans surprise puisqu'il reprend les chansons les plus connues de nirvana, mais c'est ce qu'on attendait.  C'est d'ailleurs le premier et d'autres, avec des orientations différentes, suivront surement. Ce best of reste néanmoins un incontournable. Sûr aussi que Cobain aurait détesté ça!"
1,Céline commence t-elle a lasser son public a grand renfort de mièvreries ?
5,"alala cet album déchire tout !!! j'adore lee : il a une voix magnifique, et les paroles de ses chansons sont aussi très belles. En tout cas ce chanteur a un talent fou et j'éspère vraiment qu'il va sortir un autre album !!!!!"
4,"Ronan Keating a bati son succès depuis sa cession avec les Boyzone, il y a 10 ans, sur des reprises de chansons de Tracy Chapman (Baby can i hold you), Bee Gees, Cat Stevens ( Father &amp; son),des chansons déjà connu par les amateurs de folk et de pop, mais aussi reprenant des hits de la new-country dont il est fan, comme les titres When you say nothin at all de Alison Krauss ( 1995), If tomorrow never comes de Garth Brooks (1990), mais aussi pour son tout dernier single I hope you dance, un hit de Lee Ann Womack (un succès de 2000)! Pour résumer Ronan se plait à garantir son succès avec des reprises déjà primées dans les plus grands pays, il est donc sur de satisfaire ses fans et plaire au public: curieuse recette mais ça marche! A noter aussi que Ronan aime collaborer avec les artistes country du moment, comme Brooks &amp; dunn dont il n'a pas hésité à offrir un de ses hit, the Long goodbye, poussant même la chansonnette avec une diva de la hot new country LeAnn Rimes sur Last thing on my mind. Oui Ronan keating aime la country-music et c'est réciproque! Un bon mélange qui prouve que la qualité de ces chansons n'est pas à prouver, beaucoup serait étonnés d'entendre combien il y a de hits et chansons fabuleuses sur la scène à Nashville!(country-contemporaine) Il n'y a juste qu'à se rappeler du hit de Whitney Houston, I will always love you de Dolly parton, et de I swear interprété par les All 4 one un titre de John Michael Montgomery...etc.Merci qui?!"
2,"Sans être mon groupe favori, je reconnais à u2 le statut d'icône ""vivante"" du rock, à l'instar des Stones, d'ACDC et de Springsteen. Ces mecs ont quand même pondu The Joshua Tree et écrit plus tard One. Bref ce groupe nous a habitué à de sacrées hauteurs, mais là, c'est presque la morne plaine. Le single n'a aucun intérêt, Fez est un courant d'air, les mélodies sont à l'avenant et plutôt mineures...Quelques bons trucs tels Stand Up Comedy, Breathe ou éventuellement White as Snow. Comme retour, c'est plutôt moyen, à la différence d'ACDC qui cartonne à juste titre."
5,"Tout d'abord, je suis content qu'il y ait des artistes tel que Lily Allen... En effet, c'est une jeune artiste pleine de talents. Sur cet album Alright, Still, elle mélange originalité, humour sur de la pop-ska.  Si vous n'avez jamais visité Londres, elle vous fait faire un tour très rapide avec la chanson ""LDN"".  Vous ne pouvez pas résistez sous le charme de ""Alfie"" et de ""Smile""... Je ne vous raconte pas le reste: à vous de découvrir. Enfin bref, Lily Allen sait changer l'état d'esprit des gens... elle vous fera sourire."
1,"Quelle déception à l'écoute de cet enregistrement fabuleux massacré par le remastering ! Par exemple, la contrebasse de Chambers est devenue inexistante quand elle tient son rôle d'accompagnatrice et tout le cristallin d'éditions plus anciennes a disparu. Résultat : un son sans relief et sans plus aucune chaleur alors que cet enregistrement est, normalement, d'un soyeux irresistible !"
5,"voilà un disque d'une modernité incandescente, avec des thèmes joués dans une sorte de transe ouvragée, de démence minutieuse, typiques de Dolphy!! Cet OVNI n'est pas vraiment du free, ni totalement du bop, c'est une sorte de cri qui vous pétrifie... Quand on pense que cela date de 1960, soit 5 ans après la mort de Bird...! J'aime particulièrement les versions de GW et 245."
4,"Foals réussit la prouesse de réaliser un album qui part dans toutes les directions tout en restant cohérent et impose dès lors une véritable identité musicale. Une telle démarche me fait penser à The Cure. Les titres sont variés, mais ont tous la même ""griffe"". L'ensemble est d'une qualité homogène, plutôt bonne, mais il manque deux trois titres en béton armé qui auraient pu donner encore plus de relief à Antidotes."
1,"J'avais beaucoup aimé ""Le Fil"", un album frais, plein de fantaisie et qui était réellement touchant (le magnifique ""Pâle septembre). Je suis resté totalement hermétique à ""Music Hole"", dont les morceaux donnent vraiment l'impression d'avoir été bâclés. Chaque chanson se présente à l'identique dans sa structure : une unique séquence musicale de 15-20 seondes dans le meilleur des cas, puis qui est répétée, répétée, répétée, et encore et toujours répétée, la même chose, pendant 4,5 voire 6 minutes... Aucune surprise, aucune progression, c'est déséspérément linéaire, et ce pour chacun des morceaux sans exception. Dans ces conditions, il est bien difficile d'accrocher, et pas parce que c'est ""pointu"" ou ""expérimental"" (je vois ça venir d'ici et j'attends les arguments), mais parce qu'on s'ennuie terriblement. Le pire exemple, ""Money Note"", une séquence de 3 s répétée pendant 6 minutes... Entre les extraits en écoute sur Amazon et les morceaux complets, aucune différence. Ca me paraît être un cas assez spectaculaire de manque d'inspiration. Peut-être ""Music Hole"" montre-t-il une facette de Camille à laquelle je suis moins sensible, mais la répétition comme concept musical de base, ça ne m'intéresse absolument pas."
5,"En plus de ce qui a été dit au niveau de la qualité musicale de cet opus, j'en profite pour rajouter que la version vinyle est un super double album de qualité acoustique incroyable, le tout dans une pochette superbement finie, avec un design et un visuel en triptyque super beau."
2,"Annoncé par les critiques (Télérama, Inrocks, NME) comme l'album de l'année 2009 avant même que l'année ne commence et avant que l'album ait un nom, voilà donc l'objet... Eh ben, si c'est le meilleur album de l'année, on n'est pas rendus. Certes, il y a quelque chose qui ressort de l'album, un son, des idées. Mais franchement, Animal Collective nous a sorti une bonne série de très bons albums, pas franchement mainstream, mais réussis, et là, en essayant de devenir grand public, le groupe a perdu de son attrait. Une fois qu'on a compris le principe de l'album et qu'on a reconnu le son, c'est parti pour un copier-coller sur tout l'album. En gros, une bonne chanson, et une sorte de dérive sur tout le reste de l'album. S'il est tout à fait possible de faire ce genre d'essai en jazz par exemple, ici ça ne passe pas. Pourquoi? Sans doute un manque d'âme... Voilà, entre les précédents Animal Collective et ce Marriweather Post Pavilion, ce qui a disparu, c'est l'âme."
5,"Animal Collective, on aime ou on n'aime pas, mais pour l'auditeur curieux, c'est une véritable mine d'or. Chaque morceau est une pièce surprenante qui nous donne envie de lire la prochaine. Album après album je suis toujours impressionné par la géniale inventivité de ce groupe et Merriweather Post Pavilion nous mène à nouveau dans un paysage inconnu, coloré et tourbillonnant. Mon disque de l'année pour le moment."
1,"Dans certains moments on est pour l'euthanasie, la souffrance de voir un être sombré dans la déchéance ne mérite-t-elle pas d'être arrêtée? Certains continuaient après « Au-delà de mes limites » à croire en Rohff, force est de constater qu'ils s'étaient largement trompés, preuve est faite avec cet album. Rohff (Rimeur Offensif Honorant le Fond et la Forme) a oublié ce que voulait dire son nom. Le fond, qui n'est déjà pas sa grande spécialité au départ, reste le même, nul. Même dans le très médiocre ""hypocrite love"" censé décrire une histoire d'amour, le rappeur trouve le moyen de placer quelques rimes comme quoi il a de l'argent et qu'il est trop fort. Dans testament ""pourquoi tu cours en criant police au secours, J'allais pas te tirer dessus, mais peut-être te crosser par amour...""dit il à son frère qu'il a braqué d'une arme. (Peut-être une nouvelle méthode pédagogique, après le martinet, le coup de crosse...) Bref, Rohff est bien l'exemple même de ce qui ne va plus dans le rap. La forme? Inexistante. Sur ses précédents albums, la forme palliait les insuffisances du fond, mais même là, le flow est inexistant, les instru sans saveurs. Bref vous l'aurez compris, une daube de plus dans le rap, mais une valeur sure : ""En 2008, Le Code de l'horreur sera classé numéro sept des meilleures ventes d'albums Hip Hop et RnB en France, avec 105 200 exemplaires écoulés""..."
4,"Ray Wilson, le remplaçant de Phil Collins au chant, est un très bon chanteur et il nous le montre tout au long de ce disque qui est mieux que ce que je pensais. Le morceau-titre est profond, Congo est super, Shipwrecked est émouvant. Finalement un bon disque, et très sombre, ce que j'adore."
2,"La première écoute est difficile et décevente et pourtant je suis fan de la première heure de Lara Fabian! Et puis petit à petit on s'y fait mais pas trop longtemps quand même sauf, peut-être, si on aime les reprises. Si au moins il y avait eu un orchestre derrière, car boîte à rythme n'arrange rien! A ne surtout pas faire écouter aux maris ""anti-Lara"" comme le mien ni aux motards en quête de bière (cf autre commentaire du site)!!!!"
1,"Et bien, elle ne s'est pas trop foulé cette fois lara, moi qui croyait me faire plaisir, j'aurais dû acheté un autre album que celui-ci car ces interprétations genre ""façon de la soupe"", eh bien  elles sont réchauffés !!!!!Dommage car jusqu'à présent j'avais toujours été très content de ses albums... Franchement Lara, faut arretez de nous prendre pour des dingues, alors si j'ai un conseil à vous donnez : je ne vous le conseil pas ce nouvel album , mais ce n'est que mon avis...  Allez bye"
1,"Passé le tube Yours hands around my throat, on retombe dans les travers de Death in Vegas : une électro lassante et des créations musicales au fort arrière goût de déjà vu."
4,"Un ecxelent album , missy nous avais très satisfait avec missy...so addictive et on craignait que son nouvel album ne soit pas à la hauteur.Erreur :under construction succède avec brio à missy..so addictive."
1,"Face au tollé provoqué par mon premier commentaire (il faut dire que je m'attaquais à une institution, vous pensez, l'équivalent féminin de Johnny Hallyday...), je vais donc exclusivement me livrer à l'analyse (si j'ose dire, car il n'y a guère matière à cela ici) de ce single. Les paroles : assez minimales (""Sexy coma, sexy trauma"" et une suite de mots parmi lesquels on peut distinguer ""extatique"", et une énième allusion au Styx - oui, bon, on a compris qu'elle lit des livres -). La musique : et non, il ne s'agit pas d'électro ou de techno, mais de dance très pauvre et bien calibrée pour la FM, digne d'un Guetta !  Le clip : là encore rien de bien nouveau, on nage en plein mysticisme technologique, un oeil sur les films de science-fiction ( ), un autre sur les clips de Madonna et de Björk (deux influences avouées). Que dire d'autre ? Que ce titre serait sorti dans les années 90 ou serait l'oeuvre d'Alizée (ou de tant d'autres), personne n'y trouverait à redire. Que depuis une dizaine d'années, Miss Farmer est en panne sèche d'inspiration (toujours les mêmes thèmes, la même musique) ou pire, joue la sécurité (ce qui serait inqualifiable de la part d'une chanteuse à l'abri du besoin comme elle). Et enfin, que si pour vous une bonne chanson pop est une chanson qu'on a dans la tête au bout de deux écoutes (en attendant d'en être délogée par une autre du même accabit), qu'on peut fredonner sous la douche, alors oui, il vous faut celle-là dans votre collection. Mais dans ce cas, ""La danse des canards"" ou ""Le petit bonhomme en mousse"" sont aussi de bonnes chansons pop...."
5,"Ouf, je ressors de la 3eme ecoute de cet album.La musique commence a s'impreigner.Je peux vous dire qu'on voyage avec ce genre d'album. Je trouve que les actualités Rock pop sont un peu maurose, Du deja entendu ... MEME réfrain. Pas sur la planete Mars Volta, que du bon ... original à condition qu'on accepte la voie haute perchée de Cedric Bixler. Prenez un fond de floyd et  un zeste de dream Theater et vous obtiendrez The mars Volta . Cet album est pour moi une nouvelle perle d'originalité .J'adore la basse sur certains morceaux .   Mention special pour Ilyana,Goliath  et Mention tres special pour Sothsayer. J'ai vraiment envi de defendre cet album. L'histoire de bien commencer cette année ... ACHETEZ LE et PREPAREZ VOUS POUR LE GRAND VOYAGE"
4,"Comme toutes les BOF de Michel Honner, c'est très beau, et on se retrouve très vite dans les scènes du film... A posséder si on a aimé le film."
5,"Si un jeune veut commencer une collection rock, il DOIT entamer celle-ci par cet album, pur joyau de la couronne britannique. Tout a été dit sur les fabulous four musiciens de ce groupe légendaire, mais comment ne pas s'extasier encore aujourd'hui sur un morceau comme ""whole lotta love"" ou les cris déchirés et jouissifs de PLANT vous font encore frémir comme à l'aube des années 70. ""What is and what should never be"" qui alterne les passages doux et la violence de la grosse caisse du défunt BONHAM. Pas un titre plus faible ou inégal qu'un autre. Il se dégage de l'ensemble une perfection, une homogénéité sur le plan musical que toute une génération de gratteux ont repris de façon besogneuse sur leur manche. UN CHEF D'OEUVRE, tout simplement. ""thank you""."
4,"Les Fleur de Lys sont un groupe de musiciens talentueux des années 60, complétement inconnus et changeants Haskell, Sears,.... Cela donne un disque qui mélangent les chefs d'oeuvre aux morceaux un peu ratés de R'and B' sans grande originalité. Quand FdL se décide à faire du psychédilique c'est formidable ( Hold on, Mud in your eye..... ) avec leur guitares distordues, ce sont de grands moments. Un groupe obscur, mais qui mérite d'être un peu plus connu, d'ailleurs ils ont été produits par Jimmy Page, pour dire que certains se sont aperçus de leur talent."
5,"Si vous n'avez que très peu goûté à Led Zep alors cet album peut être un très bon angle d'approche. Un poil rageur (moins que les précédents), une excellente assise rythmique et une maîtrise parfaite. Inutile de s'étaler sur ""Immigrant Song"", un standard à lui tout seul. Led Zep enchaîne alors sur ""Celebration day"" pour nous délecter d'un enchevêtrement de guitares comme Jimmy sait les réussir. A peine notre souffle repris, c'est ""Since I've been Loving You"" qui, si on devait le résumer, serait la réponse à la grande question: pourquoi LedZep. Ecouter le duel banjo (Jimmy Page) / basse (John-Paul Jones) sur ""Gallows Poles"", un pur élixir ! ""Tangerine"" arrive à point nommé pour nous faire reprendre le souffle. Quelques accords de grat sèche et déjà une mélodie enjôleuse nous envahi. On poursuivra tendrement avec ""That's the way"" jusqu'à ce que ""Bron-Y-Aur Stomp"" sonne le glas de cette mélancolie, mais avec quelles délicatesses ! Enfin l'album se clôt sur un ""chapeau bas à Roy Harper"" ..."
5,"Cet album est une célébration dédiée à un frère de sang ""Bon Scott"". Ils auraient pu arrêter la musique et vivre de leurs rentes, ils auraient pu se remettre à la musique en livrant un truc commercial, comme la plus-part des groupes. Mais, ces hommes sont tout autres, ce sont des purs. Ils voulaient reprendre la musique car le rock est leur vie, et Bon Scott l'aurait voulu ainsi, mais  sous l'avalanche de chanteurs qu'on leur proposa, ils choisirent le plus simple, un des plus inconnu, un homme qui conduisit leur bus, un homme vrai comme eux, sans artifices. Ainsi ""back in black"" naquit et le tocsin retentit. ""hells bells"" marque les esprits et les titres magnifiques s'enchainent ""shoot to thrill"", ""giving a dog a bone"", ""let me put my love into you"", ""back in black"", ""have a drink on me"", ""shake a leg"", et le bouquet final hommage au rock ""rock'n'roll ain't noise pollution"". AC/DC est revenu avec Brian Johnson, ""back in black"" est le plus bel hommage qu'un groupe de rock ai pu léguer à un frère disparu. Par la suite, dans les années 80, ils traversèrent une crise car il fallait reconstruire sur de nouvelles bases, et il était trop tôt. Ils se retrouvèrent vraiment avec le retour de Phil Rudd, 15 ans plus tard, avec l'album ""ballbreaker"". Le deuil avait été long, la disparition de Bon Scott avait vraiment mis beaucoup de temps à cicatriser, mais dés lors AC/DC est le groupe rock, un MONUMENT qui a su traverser les enfers pour embraser les cieux."
2,"Franchement ! vous le trouvez bien vous se ""Snif upper lip"" ? . Admettez quand même que le Hard bluesy des Australiens n'a jamais été aussi peu inspiré que sur cet album . ok ! je vous l'accorde le morceau d'introduction est vraiment sympa , ""Hold me back"" et ses notes piquées tout comme ""Can't stand still"" prêtent aussi à taper du pied , mais le reste ... Que tout celà est poussif . Je veux bien aussi que phil Rudd se la joue économe , mais à se point là ! on ne parle plus d'économie , c'est carrément de la feinéantise (tchic boom tchic boom ...) . Quand à Brian Johnson , son sûr nom de ""casquette hurlante "" m'apparait là aussi totalement usurpé . L'age !!? Ben oui et alors ! Dio , Coverdale , Gillan , quel age croyez vous qu'ils ont ? . Le chanteur esquisse , tente de voiler la face , mais ne soyons pas dupe , ça ne vient plus du ventre mais du fond de la gorge ; Du reste , j'observe également que lors de la tournée promo de l'album , seul 1 morceau fût jouer durant tout le Set . Durant la tournée ""Razors edge"" et ""Ballbreaker"" , les morceaux de leurs nouveaux album respectif se comptaient aux nombres de 5 ou 6 . A partir de là , je crois bien que tout est dit . A bon entendeurs SALUTE . 08/20"
2,"Superbe dique, même si parfois le son MONO ne donne pas toujours. Mais là c'est la génése des Beatles et l'immense répertoire qui étaient le leurs et l'on comprend pourquoi ils sont devenu aussi grand, toutes une époque fin fifties et début sixties La joie le bonheur d'une génération.Superbe témoignage Bonne écoute......"
4,"C'est avec ce cd que j'ai découvert Metallica,depuis je les ai tous écouté et je trouve le mariage de l'orchestre et du groupe assez réussi(surtout lorsque l'on sait qu'ils n'ont eut que deux jours pour regler les 150 micros)Pour ce qui est du cd en lui-méme je trouve la version de ""The call of the ktulu"" réussi ainsi que le titre inédit ""No Leaf clover"" qui dégage une tres grande puissance.Bref le pari est quand meme gagner pour Metallica qui nous amene sur une autre dimension ."
5,"Merci Thierry, un album méconu en effet, enregistré dans l'urgence et le drame, mais justement, c'est du ""brut"", et il a bien traversé le temps..."
2,Selon moi Presence est un des pires albums de Led Zep.Meme si il contient Achile Last Stand (qui est une bonne chanson) je trouve le reste de l'album assez ennuyant.Nobody's Fault But Mine pourrait etre une tres bonne chanson si elle ne saurait pas aussi répétitive.Et je trouve que Tea For One est un peu trop copier sur Since i've Been Loving you (Led Zeppelin III) Alors pour finir si vous ne connaissez pas Led Zep et que vous voulez vous achetez un album ne prenez surtout pas celui la!
5,"Comment certains sur ce site peuvent critiquer un tel chef-d'oeuvre !!! On tient là une des pierres angulaires du rock !!! L'insasiable Hendrix passe du psychédélique, au blues et pose les premiers jalons du hard rock !!! Alors, non messieurs, on ne critique pas, ou alors on s'abstient !!!"
5,"Je sais que ce site n'est pas un Forum, mais pour répondre à la question de Rémy cool :""Pourquoi le groupe plutôt que de s'enliser dans son coin en grattant souvent à tort et à travers, ne s'est pas limité à jouer plus sobre, moins fier et surtout moins long ?"" =&gt; S'ils ne l'avaient pas fait, Made In Japan ne serait pas le meilleur Live enregistré à ce jour (de part les critiques, le monde de la musique, etc). Ce live n'est pas seulement des coups de solo pausés à droite à gauche, c'est l'aboutissement d'un travail entre plusieurs membres d'un groupe de génie,  qui se situe lors de sa tournée au Japon au point culminant de sa carrière (Mk II). De plus,même si cette période de l'histoire de la musique eétait celle de talents fous (ceux énuméré par Rémy Cool...), personne n'égalait les talents et la dextérité d'improvisations de Blackmore et de Lord en live (exepté dans un autre registre Keith Emerson), et personne de l'égalera jamais plus...Certains des morceaux de Made In Japan sont à la note près, au slide près, à la blue note près...simplement parfait. Enfin, Fireball est un morceau très difficile à jouer Live. Pour toute c'est raison, Made In Japan reste LE Live à possèder...Une pure découverte qui vous ouvrira les yeux..."
2,"Rien d'indigne ici, mais rien de vraiment valable non plus à un The wrestler près. On ne peut se résigner à un tel robinet d'eau tiédasse de la part de l'auteur de Jungleland, Thunder Road, Point Blank, Racing in the street, Downbound train... Et dire que certains dénonçaient le ""remplissage"" de The River : le fan se damnerait aujourd'hui pour un Ramrod, un Little girl I wanna marry you ou un I'm a rocker !!! Et Tunnel of Love à côté des quatre derniers albums, c'est Blonde on blonde ! Soyons clair : au mieux, en studio, Bruce sait encore façonner des chansons pop sympas (type : Girls in their summer clothes)ou reprendre le patrimoine (The Seeger sessions). Pour consoler les grognards, reste l'homme (intègre) et le performer live (inégalable). Et les albums de l'âge d'or. Ce n'est pas rien."
5,"On a beau dire, les français n'aiment pas les albums engagés. Quand on voit le traitement réservé à ce ""Livin with war"" tout à fait honorable et beaucoup moins pantouflard que ""Greendale"", on se dit que depuis qu'on a fait la révolution de 89, on ne supporte pas qu'un musicien défende une cause. De plus, Neil Young transporte un paquet de casseroles avec lui, dont l'une s'appelle ""Harvest"". On attend du Loner qu'il nous réchauffe l'âme avec des albums ""sympas"", qu'on peut fredonner au coin du feu. Il n'y a qu'à voir les ventes de ses albums électriques comparées à celles de ses albums acoustiques. Un album anti-guerre, c'est bon pour le prolo de service, genre Springsteen ou Mellencamp. Neil Young, c'est du raffiné, pas le genre à chausser les gros sabots de la critique sociale. Le protest-album, c'est réservé aux pouilleux du rock. Neil va encore se faire traiter de vieux hippie par les gentils garçons qui croient toujours que l'esprit des sixties est révolu (on verra bien leur tête dans quelques mois). On peut balayer toutes ces critiques en excluant le message : cet album ""rocke"" à mort et ça faisait un bout de temps que Neil n'avait pas chausser les crampons. Quant au contenu, rien que d'imaginer les nerfs que ça va donner à certaines personnes, j'en assure directement la distribution. Plus sérieusement, cet album n'invente pas la poudre mais il est tout de même bluffant de voir un type d'une soixantaine d'années venant en découdre avec les green 182 et autres.  Keep on rockin in the free world ! Ultra recommandé."
5,"On est en 1970.  Townshend, en combinaison de pompiste-un petit métier aujourd'hui disparu-mouline sur sa Gibson rouge. Daltrey-avec ses fringues de daim à franges-se la joue Davy Crockett sans son chapeau, Moon est planqué derrière sa double Premier, et Entwistle, impassible, fait trembler les murs en cadence.  On est au theâtre des Champs-Elysées et ils jouent à fond, sans retenue, sans compter, à mort. Les baffles crachent 6400 watts.  C'est un concert historique par sa durée, son intensité, sa violence.  Tout y passe depuis Tommy en intégrale jusqu'à Magic Bus en passant par des hits-type Substitute- du blues-Young Man Blues-du rock-le medley Summertime/Shakin'- et bien sûr ""Mmmmyyy Generation"". Townshend saute et riffe, Daltrey hurle puis balance son micro comme une fronde, Moon cogne et gifle,  Entwistle gronde et  fait vibrer jusqu'aux sièges.  Un mur de son sans fin. C'était la grande époque et leur grande époque. Le meilleur d'eux-mêmes.  Ce qu'ils ont fait à Paris, ils l'on fait à Leeds et vous l'avez dans ce double CD.  A écouter à fond sans freins ni limites. Long Live Rock"
5,"personnellement, j'ais découvert Pearl Jam avec cet album et j'ais tout de suite adoré l'ambiance de celui-ci et tout ces titres, je conseillerai donc vivement d'acheter cet album (contrairement aux propos de PearlJamFan qui n'en est pas un vrai!) à la place de Yield qui ne mérite pas ça réputation et qui ma déçu (par ex avec ""do the évolution"" qui est plus mou qu'en live oû il claque si j'puis dire...)malgrée qu'il y ait des titres pionnniers de pearl jam. Bref, il est fortement conseillé d'acheter cet album très complet. Je conseillerai aussi d'acheter plusieurs lives car il faut tout de meme avouer qu'ils y sont meilleurs. (ex: live on two legs qui regroupe plusieurs exellents titres tels que ""daugther"" ou ""off he goes"" ...)"
5,"En 1974 sortait ce triple album live de Santana avec sa pochette pleine de messages, et puis, nous avons maintenant cette réédition de 1991 en double cd qui permet de retrouver le grand Carlos Santana dans des envolées guitaristiques de toute beauté ! Meilleure époque de notre artiste qui n'hésitait pas à étirer des titres mémorables pour délirer en longs solis saturés et plein d'effets de son comme dans ""incident at neshabur"" qui nous transporte pendant 16 mn. Parmi des compositions connues ""oye como va"" ""batuka"" ou encore ""se a cabo"" et ""toussaint l'overture"" se glissent des morceaux moins populaires mais aussi prenants comme ""free angela"" très fluide à la ryhtmique lancinante ou ""mantra"" un free jazz psyché mystérieux où la guitare au son très travaillé nous emmène dans des contrées mystiques. Nous n'échappons pas au long solo de batterie dans ""kyoto"", où Michaêl Shrieve prouve qu'il est un excellent batteur. Deux cd pour 22 titres et plus de 2 heures de rock latino très teinté de free jazz psychédélique, capturés en live au Japon en 1973 reste une référence incontournable dans la longue carrière de notre virtuose de la guitare qu'est Carlos Santana."
5,"La disparition de Jeff si jeune, met un éclairage nouveau sur cette oeuvre et sa diffusion trop discrète. Bluesman exceptionnel méritant sa place aux côtés d'un Stevie Ray lui aussi parti trop vite.  Tout guitariste doit voir un jour sa video ! Ce disque ô combien biographique, est un must dans toute collection. Aujourd'hui il revoit la lumière ... ca doit jammer là haut avec Stevie ! The sky is crying ..."
5,"Le meilleur d'Alvin Lee Un chef d'oeuvre de blues ( help me ), des morceau lives magistralement menés par Alvin Lee. Cet album peu connu mérite beaucoup plus. Toutes les personnes aimant le blues rock doit impérativement le posséder. Le faire écouter aux amis permet de valoriser ce petit bijou. IL FAUT ABSOLUMENT L'ACHETER. Je me porte garant de la qualité musicale de cet album. Allez y, lancez vous!! CROYEZ MOI C'EST DU DIAMANT"
2,"Ce double album n'est pas la bérézina ni le Titanic, mais on en est pas loin! déjà avec ""Close To The Edge"" on en approchait à grands pas!!! Eh oui, je fais partie de ces gens qui n'ont jamais accroché à ces 2 loukoums prétentieux (les fans de Yes appellent ça des 'Chef d'Oeuvre'!!!...Grand Dieux!!!). Non, décidément ""The Yes Album"", ""Fragile"", ""Relayer"" (qui comporte de longues suites mais qui ne sont pas stériles!) et même ""Tormato"" et ""Drama"" (avec ces 2 là pour références, je suis maudit à tout jamais par les fans) ont nettement plus de substance. Y'a pas photo!...reste quelques passages intéressants (hélas, ça n'a jamais suffit pour faire un grand disque, à fortiori un double album!!!)."
2,"Album réalisé à l'occasion de la 1ere reformation du goupe et d'une tournée ""alimentaire"" au Japon (la destination à la mode de l'époque), celui-ci démontre clairement que la magie a disparu."
5,"c'est ce qu'il y a d'écrit sur ma prescription médicale ! c'est donc recommandé par mon médecin, contre la maurosité, la déprime, le mauvais temps, les histoires de coeur, les soucis de fric, la famille et les amis qui sont loin. Au lieu de bouffer du Prozac, ou de chercher une corde, il est hautement recommandé de placer ceci sur la platine, l'avantage de cette compile, à la pochette horrible, c'est qu'il n'y a rien à zapper. Merci Docteur, aujourd'hui, j'vais m'en faire deux, de toutes façons, c'est marqué dessus, il n' a aucun danger d'accoutumance."
1,"Slipknot ? Groupe de 9 musicos déjantés jouant des accords dechainés voila le decor planté. Troisieme opus du groupe : une grande déception sur le plan musical  dans le sens où une certaine maturité vient de faire son apparition comme les titres ""circle"" ou ""vermilion"" une déception ou plutôt le fait de voir un groupe prendre un virage à 90° au regret des "" People = shit"" "" Wait and bleed"" j'en passe et des meilleurs ... Mais il faut aussi se réjouir de quelques bons morceaux sur leur nouvel album. Pour conclure il est certain que les fans des premiers jours ne seront pas conquis à moins de plusieurs écoutes et d'un changement de vision sur Slipknot ... Quand l'argent ""joue"" du métal, des albums commerciaux naissent et des groupes s'éteignent !"
5,"Ne rentrons pas dans le débat : Death ou pas Death ? Tout ce qu'il faut retenir, c'est que Slipknot est un énorme groupe de hard rock. Du bon gros hard rock. Voilà, c'est tout. Après deux premiers albums de style plutôt similaires, Verse 3 nous montre le groupe sous un jour nouveau. Un peu moins fous, montrant qu'ils sont parfaitement capables de maîtriser leurs instruments. La voix de Corey est même belle par moment. Souvenez-vous lors de la sortie de leur premier album, tout le monde disait que Slipknot était un éphémère feu de paille. Verse 3 vient nous montrer le contraire avec brio. A mon avis, on risque d'entndre parler de ces neufs gars là encore un bon moment. Et c'est tant mieux..."
5,"Ce n'est pas ce qu'il risque de vous arriver à l'écoute de cet album. Il ne s'agit pas de renouveau du metal ou du rock français mais bien d'une révolution! Watcha a son style personnel, qui se remarque dès la première écoute. L'originalité et le désir de ne pas faire comme les autres est omniprésent sur cette ""galette"". Des rythmes décalés, une voix (et quelle voix!) à la fois puissante, agressive et douce, des guitares sorties de nulle part pour réinventer le mot ""lourd"" et un jeu de basse batterie à vous couper le souffle. Non, Watcha n'est pas Pleymo et encore moins Enhancer (groupes que j'affectionne beaucoup). Watcha est et restera Watcha. Ils nous montrent avec cet album éponyme que le metal n'en est qu'à ses débuts et que tout reste à inventer si on a une once d'imagination et de talent! Les points forts de l'album sont : ""Elle dort"" et ""Méchant flou"". A posséder absolument. FF"
2,"Tiens, j'entend dire ici ou là que le dernier Soulfly est un vrai retour aux sources pour son leader Max Cavalera, à celles de sepultura s'entend...  On a pas du écouter le même disque... Aucun titre ne retient mon attention, la rage est bien là mais pas l'âme. On entend quelques sonorités empreintées au glorieux passé de Sepultura mais bon, pas de quoi comparer Dark Ages avec Chaos A.D. J'ai tendance à trouver cet album (encore) moins bons que les précédents du groupe. Pas mal de morceaux horribles (""Frontlines"", ""Molotov"", ""Riotstarter""...) et des interludes inutiles. Le disque devient même inécoutable là ou des samples stridants viennent rendre les morceaux insupportables (""Riotstarter"" et surtout ""Bleak""). Alors, c'est vrai que Soulfly a durci le ton mais maladroitement, un peu comme Metallica l'avait fait sur son dernier album de triste mémoire. Et puis, lorsque le groupe tente d'expérimenter, là aussi, c'est mauvais (entre autre, le passage easy listening sur ""I and I"", le passage calme sur ""Staystrong"" ou le trip bossa de plus de 10 minutes pour conclure l'album). Bref, pas de quoi patienter jusqu'à la reformation de Sepultura..."
5,"A l'instar de ses consoeurs de la nu-soul US, la voix de cet anglaise se démarque vraiment. Cela peut rebuter certains, moi ca m'a vraiment séduit.  Les morceaux sont vraiment bien construits et m'ont rapidement emballé. Je n'avait pas eu un tel choc depuis le premier album de Jill Scott.  C'est bizarre qu'elle ne soit pas très connue en France.A  découvrir absolument."
1,"J'ai mis toutes les chances de mon côté pour apprécier cet album.Je me suis laissé pousser les moustaches,greffer des poils sur le torse et enfin je me suis procuré un tee-shirt d'ACDC et ............ le néant. Aucune sensation si ce n'est l'ennui.Comment peut-on dire de ce Justice que ce sont les dignes héritiers des DAFT? Cela relève de l'hérésie. Cette galette est une succession de morceaux sans originalité aucune,les breaks sont prévisibles et souvent mous du genou.Pas un seul titre à sauver de la noyade.Pas une seule bonne idée. ED BANGER aurait éte bien inspiré de faire comme l'éditeur des compils FABRIC,à savoir refuser de publier une telle daube. Pour conclure investissez plutôt dans l'album de TEENAGE BAD GIRL,vous n'aurez pas l'impression d'avoir gaspillé vos euros."
1,"La maison disque a voulu assuremment surfer sur la vague Amy Winehouse sauf que Duffy avec sa voix de canard nous gonfle dès les premières secondes. Ecoutez à la 39ème seconde du titre 1, elle se permet de râter sa note et de chanter faux. ça fait même mal aux oreilles dès la 2ème minute12. Au secours !! Que nous donne cet album : une pâle copie d'Amy genre fabriquée en Chine car on se demande comment avec la prise en studio, on a pu laisser passer des faussetés pareilles. On dirait Camélia Jordana en pire si c'est possible. Au niveau arrangements et compositions, rien à redire : c'est nickel... Il faudrait utiliser -vous savez- ces logiciels qui vous enlèvent la voix d'une piste CD..."
5,"Supergrass: le groupe de power pop par excellence. Les morceaux de cet album sont grooves influencés par les 70th et d'une énergie redoutable.  Enfin, bref, aucunes tâches d'huile dans ce lp. Il est certain que supergrass est un groupe indispensable. Il nous le prouve dans cet album. Mais où trouve-t-il cette inspiration?"
1,"Le départ de Craig Walker sonne visiblement le glas de ce groupe pour qui j'avais une admiration sans faille. Comment passer du chef d'oeuvre ""Noise"" à une telle soupe ?. On a vraiment envie de tirer les cheveux de la demi fole qui nous hurle dans les tympans à longueur du CD. Ce n'est pas expérimental, c'est bruyant, pédant et raté. Pourvu que Walker nous fasse quelque chose en solo."
5,"Oh OUI !! LA BELLE éPOQUE, LE MAGICIEN SORT LA GROSSE CAISSE POUR NOUS FAIRE BOUGER ET DANSER, MEME MICHAEL JACKSON POSE  SA VOIX SUR CE PETIT BIJOU DE FUNK ET QUE DIRE DU MORCEAU QUI FILE STEVIE WONDER A ''Q''. UNE PRODUCTION DE GéNIE- LA PATTE QUINCY JONES QUOI!!."
4,"Prince est un artiste à multi-facettes et à très longue carrière. Deux termes qui pourraient également résumer que l'artiste a cotoyé le génial au parfois plus hasardeux. C'est un peu ce qu'on retrouve dans ""Ultimate"", un double album dont le deuxième CD fait la part aux remixes et versions longues des titres du futur-ex Love Symbol. Du coup, les amateurs adoreront, les moins amateurs trouveront quelques longueurs mais à l'arrivée, on se retrouve face à du bon, incontestablement. Ce disque peut donc constituer une entrée intéressante pour qui veut pénétrer l'univers de l'artiste sans dépenser une fortune..."
2,"Meme pour un grand fan de Stevie Wonder, ce disque est décevant. C'est l'un de ses derniers albums (peut etre meme le dernier ?) sorti en 1981. Meme la présence du titre 'Free', reprise à tout va dans les publicités, ne sauve pas le niveau trres moyen de ce disque."
4,tres bon opus du maitre en la matiere qui nous livre un opus comme le titre nous le dis c jsute lui et le meilleur de lui et comparer a c deux precedant album je peux vous dire qu'il est bien au dessus avec des slow jam qui reste dans la tete  mais a vous de jugez et bonne ecoute!!!!
1,"Que les inconditionnels d'ABBA dont je fais partie se rassurent: Abba est et restera un groupe mytique. Toutefois leurs disquesn, dont voici le dernier, sont de médiocre qualité. Celui ci a, nous dit on, été remastérisé. Certainement, mais quand la prise de son initiale est mauvaise, il n'y a rien à faire pour l'améliorer. Qu'on en juge: image stéréo sans aucun relief, balance déséquilibrée au profit des extrémités du spectre, avec un médium quasi inexistant, dynamique tassée. Si ABBA brillait par ses compositions et sa présence scénique , il n'a jamais été bien exigeant sur le choix de ses ingénieurs du son, c'est un fait! Abba méritait mieux..."
5,"Malgré un concept hautement casse gueule (la transcription de tubes rock récents en standards du swing !), Paul Anka nous délivre ici une leçon magistrale. Les réorchestrations sont inspirées et exécutées impeccablement. Anka fait preuve d'une grande maîtrise vocale, alternant puissance dans les parties rythmées et caresse dans les tempos lents. Il nous rappelle au passage qu'il est, après la disparition de Frank Sinatra (pour lequel il avait écrit ""My way""), l'un des derniers grands crooners de notre époque (sans oublier Tony Bennett quand même). Pas de faute de goût dans ce CD qui voit l'interprête de ""Diana"" et de ""Put your head on my shoulder"" reprendre sans complexe du Nirvana, du Van Halen et de l'Oasis ! Le résultat est si stupéfiant que l'on se demande qu'elle est finalement la version originale ! Bien plus qu'un exercice de style, ""Rock Swings"" est un vrai bon disque susceptible de plaire à tous les publics, jazz et rock confondus. Chapeau bas."
5,Je viens juste de le recevoir et le cd tourne. J'en suis ravie. J'adore le punch que Butler apporte à ses titres avec le côtés folk qui me fait penser à la musique celte ce qui pour moi est très agréable. Je le recommande +++++
2,"J'attendais pourtant avec impatience ce nouvel opus, après les glorieux ""break syndical"", ""motel capri"" et ""attache ta tuque"" qui,pleins de pêche et pur jus québecquois, étaient de splendides découvertes."
5,"Je trouve que Les Cowboys Fringants,avec les années, nous ont montrer de quoi ils étaient capable..! Avec tout leurs cd. Des chansons qui font réfléchir,des chansons joyeuses qui nous donnent le goût d'avancer! Je crois qu'ils représentent bien le Québec. Je les trouves fantastique!"
2,je pensait retrouver le style electro mais hélas j'ai été decu par cet album qui se rapproche plus de la soul que de la pop ! Cependant certaine chanson comme american pie sont assez bien reussis .
5,"On le sait, Madonna est surtout l'artiste de hits plus qu'albums. Dès lors, une compilation en forme de best-of prend tout son sens ici. A l'heure où le coffret 'Celebration' sort pour se retourner sur une immense carrière, ce premier best-of n'en reste pas moins digne d'intérêt. D'abord parce qu'il se concentre sur la première partie de carrière de l'artiste, ensuite parce que ce best-of était particulièrement bien balancé. En l'occurrence, on pourra toujours disserter sur le moment durant lequel la carrière de la Madonne aura été le plus riche. D'aucuns affirmeront que l'artiste a pris son envol créatif avec 'Ray of Light', il n'en demeure pas moins que cet 'Immaculate' met en perspective la capacité de Madonna à transcender les foules par l'entremise de titres aussi efficaces qu'intemporels. Rien que pour ça, on ne peut pas ne pas recommander ce disque."
1,"Qu reste-t-il de nos amours ? ici le jazz est réduit à une toile de fond médiocre et insipide. La belle a une voix inexpressive et stéréotypée.   Bessie, Sarah, Carmen, Nina, Billi, Ella, Betty et Cassandra ne sont pas  de la famille de  cette pauvre petite qui ici chante mollement"
4,"Ce Trio du Colorado, localisé à Brooklyn, surfe sur la vague déferlante de la pop en couleur de leurs copains de MGMT. Principal atout : la voix coquine et câline de la miss Caroline (Polachek) et qui permet à la plupart des titres de Does you inspire you de sortir du lot des oeuvres banales.  Des influences multiples qu'on pourrait rassembler sous la bannière d'une électro pop minimaliste  (à l'instar de l'excellent Bruises) ; Chairlift ne joue cependant pas pour les stades mais la proximité, comme la simplicité du discours est plus que séduisante alors qu'elle pourrait tout autant produire l'effet inverse ; un charme indéniable donc et qui a incité Phoenix à les choisir en première partie de leur tournée française en octobre prochain. D'ailleurs, l'univers des Versaillais et des Américains n'est finalement pas si éloigné."
5,"L'immense succès de cet album est totalement justifié. Kylie prouve une fois de plus qu'elle est la meilleure au monde; son arrivée dans le domaine de l'électro est pleinement réussie. ""Can't get you out of my head"" et ""Love at first sight"" sont des tubes d'exception que l'on peut écouter en boucle sans se lasser. ""In your eyes"" une petite merveille électro et ""Come into my world"", légèrement en retrait, reste d'un très bon niveau. Mais il n'y a pas que les singles: ""Dancefloor"" et ""Give it to me"" sont 2 morceaux très entraînants, ""More, More, More"" est une superbe performance vocale, ""Burning up"" est assez spécial mais très sympathique, ""Fever"" un bon titre sans être génial. En tout 8 morceaux de très grande qualité, 1 de bonne qualité, et 3 chansons lentes pour compléter. Pas mes préférées, mais il y en a qui aiment... Au total, ""Fever"" est un album particulièrement réussi, dont 8 titres étaient des singles potentiels, ce qui est très rare."
2,"Heureusement la version edit (originale) de la chanson est là ! car c'est sûrement la version la meilleure de Die Another Day...les remix réalisés ne sont pas bien originaux, seul peut-être le Thee Retrolectro mix l'est, ni très sympas....ils sont plutôt fait pour une soirée rave ou un genre de soirée électro que pour une soirée pop.......ils manquent réellement de saveur, on dirait qu'ils ont été fait en toute hâte ou tout simplement pour faire des remix sans penser à apporter quelque chose à la chanson....le refrain, qui est presque toute la chanson à lui seul, est déjà assez fatiguant....mais remixé avec des sons qui ne reposent en rien l'esprit, et celà pendant 9 minutes de temps, c'est trop ! trop banal, trop fatiguant ( on a du mal à écouter les 6 d'un coup sans avoir mal à la tête !) . Mais Madonna a t-elle eu le choix de ces remix ? La chanson ""Die another day"" est une BO conduite par la société qui a réalisé le dernier James Bond....elle a vraisemblablement influé sur les remix également...dommage...."
5,"Pour moi, cet album est le chef d'oeuvre de Tori, il est rempli de petites merveilles qui ont bercées mon adolescence. Entre mystique et divin... Merci Tori"
2,insuffisant!!!! sachez que la cassette contient en plus toutes les faces B de ce CD
5,"Je ne comprends pas pourquoi tant de fans des Pixies se disent déçus par cet album. Certes, il est très différent des ""Surfer Rosa"" et autres ""Doolittle"" qui ont établi la réputation des Lutins. L'apport des claviers d'Eric Drew Feldman, la construction moins déglinguée de certaines chansons, les refrains ""catchy"" indiquent dans quel direction partira Frank Black avec son premier opus solo en 1993. Mais comment, je vous le demande, comment peut-on se dire déçu par un album qui contient des joyaux tels que ""Motorway to Roswell"", ""Alec Eiffel"" ou ""Bird Dream of the Olympus Mons"" ? Frank Black dira, bien des années plus tard : ""Vous n'aimerez jamais aucun de mes album si vous ne les écoutez qu'une fois"". Vous savez ce qu'il vous reste à faire."
4,"je suis toujours tellement surpris lorsque je réecoute cet album...dont on ne s'etendra sur l'accueil des medias qui se régalent à ecrire des conneries depuis si longtemps sur cet artiste fantastique!!!Souvenez vous des inepties à propos de ""Low"" qui est tout simplement incontournable!!! BREF.Honte à vous!!! C'est un bel album et monsieur Bowie chante merveilleusement bien autant dans ""the dreamers"" que dans le magnifique ""something in the air""...J'aime ce disque...tard le soir....tranquille et ecoute ""survive"".Merci pour tous ces moments que vous nous offrez depuis des lustres et dont je ne me lasse pas...Ciao Bellissimo David."
2,"J'ai trouvé l'album un peu fade, terne. Rien de bien original dans les compos. Certaines chansons sortent bien du lot mais le tout reste tes loin derriere certains albums de air. Au final un petit album bien gentillet dont on aura vite fait d'oublier."
4,"apparement le 1er CD est une création tandis que le 2nd est une réédition. Si le 1 s'écoute gentiment sans grnade prétention artistique, la réédition est par contre fantastique, on retrouve les débuts de la house, hyper prenant! A ne pas manquer!"
2,"Cet album illustre parfaitement le fait qu'un artiste connu peut vendre n'importe quoi sur son seul nom. Voilà un album qui, sorti par n'importe quelle artiste peu connue, serait passé complètement inaperçu dans la vaste masse des productions Rn'B et aurait été vendu à même pas dix mille exemplaires. Mais voilà, c'est Madonna, déclarée meilleure artiste pop actuelle sur la foi des seules ventes de disques (alors que tant d'autres artistes pop moins commerciaux font de la bien meilleure musique...) Alors 2 étoiles quand même car 2 ou 3 titres pas mal comme ""Give it to me"", mais le reste fleure bon la daube, notamment le calamiteux premier single signé Timbaland, c'est même triste quand on se rappelle la musique de Madonna dans les années 80, plutôt bonne. Quelquefois, il faut se méfier des premières impressions, mais ici, même plusieurs mois après sa sortie, il n'y a pas grand chose à sauver dans cet album, qui a d'ailleurs été peu apprécié par nombre de fans de la première heure. Surtout, on attendrait autre chose de la part de quelqu'un au sommet des ventes depuis 25 ans et à la tête d'une fortune immense que cet opus très indigeste et purement commercial, qui fera sans doute gagner quelques millions supplémentaires à la Madonne mais ne grandira pas sa réputation."
5,"Les Clash ont réalisés un album éclectique qui garde un son coherent du début à la fin malgrès tous les styles abordés. Un très grand triple album, vendu au prix d'un simple à l'époque, les clash ayant laissés leur droits sur les ventes pour que le plus grand nombre puisse acheter leur disque ... on est bien loin du mercantilisme des artistes contemporain ! Des tubes, du rap, du funk, du rock, du gospel, du punk, des expériences musicales et le tout avec beaucoup de gout et de maîtrise. Un ENORME album."
5,"Certaine B.O ne sont que des patchworks de titres sans âmes mais ce n'est heureusement pas le cas de celle-ci. Le rappeur américain Eminem n'a pas fait son travail à moitié en voulant faire un film quasi autobiographique. Il incarne son personnage avec charisme et nous offre en plus un c.d d'une grande qualité. Le natif de Détroit n'a pas été égoïste et ça pour notre plus grand plaisir car en plus de lacher des rimes assassines sur 4 tracks il fait participer des pointures du milieu Hip Hop comme Jay-z , Nas , ou Rakim. Ces derniers étoffent un album bien conçu avec des chansons particuliérement réussies. On notera finalement la présence des ""rookies"" (= débutants) du label d'EMINEM ,Shady Records  comme Obie Trice ou 50 Cent(ce dernier offre un des tubes du moment aux U.S avec ""WANSTA""---- à écouter !!!). En bref, cet opus qui fut un véritable succès aux Etats-Unis n'est que la confirmation qu'Eminen a un don pour le Rap. Bonne écoute !"
2,"Cet album remplacera avantageusement votre valium avant d'aller dormir, Norah a certes une belle voix mais les compos sont mollassonnes, sans originalité et les musiques plates et sans intéret. Rien ne viendra reveiller l'auditeur au long des 13 plages;comme si Norah pourtant jeune avait deja fait le tour de sa carriere et peinait a se renouveller. Voila parfaitement le type d'artistes surcotées, arrivées a la mode soutenue par  la presse et une machine marketing efficace. Du jazz pour salle d'attente de dentiste ou ascenceur.. Je vous conseille dix Cd de chanteuses de jazz moins connues et bien meilleurs - a mon gout , bien sur , mais allez donc y jetez une oreille, ils en valent la peine-""renée Olstead"";carla Cook""it's all about love"";jane Monheit""taking a chnace on love"";molly johnson""another day"";Katie Melua""call off the search""Rachelle ferrell ""live in montreux"";Stacey kent ""the boy next door"";Madeleine Peyroux ""careless love"";Diane Schuur ""midnight"",Dee Dee Bridgewater""red earth""(ce dernier en compagnie de musiciens maliens, superbe)"
2,"Autant le second album m'avait agréablement surpris, tant par son originalité, que par les accopagnements, autant celui-ci est mou, convenu, délivrant une musique propre, apsetisée, mais dépourvue de fougue, de flamme. Rien n'en ressort vraiment après deux écoutes. C'est sympa, c'est tout."
1,"Ce groupe est nul ! Ils sont pourtant fans de Soundgarden ou Nirvana ! A mon avis ils ont du écouter le best of de Patrick Fiori à la place. Comment faire de la musique aussi naze en ayant de pareils influences. Et là le pompon c'est de sortir un best of, mais un best of de quoi au juste ? Des titres les moins mauvais ou des plus inaudibles. Au secours, à fuir comme la peste ! Les jeunes si vous voulez de bons groupes, allez écouter Nirvana, Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith, Airbourne, Deep Purple, Motorhead, Foo Fighters, Soundgarden, Interpol, Muse, Joy Division, AC DC, Bauhaus, The Cure, Depeche Mode, Neil Young, Oasis...etc mais fuyez cette daube."
5,"Incontestablement l'Album de Marilyn Manson avec un grand A. Tout y est excellent, vous ne sauterez aucune chanson. Le fond musical irreprochable cotoie des paroles qui font une critique severe et incisive de la societé mais avec, contrairement aux critiques qui lui sont adressees, des paroles tres profondes. L'agencement des chansons est parfait, et on ne ressent a aucun moment une frustration a la fin d'un morceau car ils s'enchainent tres naturellement. C'est un album certes plus glam qu'Antichrist Superstar ou Holy Wood, mais Marilyn Manson s'exprime tellement bien dans ce style... Un album a écouter si vous voulez decouvrir Marilyn Manson...et à preferer de loin au commercial ""The golden age of grotesque"""
4,"L'enregistrement est excellent, le seul bemol est le honteux ""Dulcissima"" de Janowitz, chanteuse qui j'adore, mais c'est vraiment, mais vraiment beaucoup trop haut pour elle, et du coup très raide; à titre de comparaison, écoutez la fluidité et souplesse de June Anderson (Levine/DG)..."
2,"Cet album est décevant par rapport aux autres : après ""Clocks"" sur l'excellent ""A Rush Of Blood To The Head"", on retrouve des titres répétitifs qui n'ont pas beaucoup d'intêret comme  ""Fix You"", ""Talk"", ""Speed Of Sound"" ou ""Swallowed In The Sea"".  Par contre certains titres comme ""Twisted Logic"" ou ""White Shadows"" sont pas mal..."
1,"Autant j'avais apprécié les albums Parachutes et surtout A Rush of blood to the head et le son guitare sèche-piano, autant pour XY je trouve que la sauce électro est too much. Un trait de maquillage peut arranger, là le groupe y est allé à la truelle, çà fait pute.. Trop d'arrangements tue la musique, on arrive à de la pop de supermarché ou de la musique d'ascenseur. Du coup,de colère, j'ai réécouté la version acoustique de Cowgirl in the sand par Neil Young : l'émotion à l'état pur, sans artifice inutile."
5,"Ne surtout pas se fier à la première écoute qui laisse l'impression que ""X &amp; Y"" n'est qu'une simple copie carbone de l'album précédent ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"". En fait, au fur et à mesure des écoutes, on s'aperçoit que ce nouveau Coldplay est beaucoup plus subtil qu'il n'y paraît, l'évidence de certaines compositions alambiquées ne se dévoilant qu'au bout de la quatre ou cinquième fois. ""X &amp; Y"" n'est donc pas un ""A Rush of Blood to the head n°2"", simplement un autre album du niveau faramineux de son prédécesseur, qui gagne en richesse ce qu'il perd en accessibilité immédiate. Un disque incontournable pour les amateurs de belles choses donc..."
1,"Je n'ai peut-être pas bien écouté, je n'en sais rien, mais ce genre, bien que je sois ouvert, ne me fait rien du tout. Autechre m'ennuie profondément."
5,C'est agréable de pouvoir ré entendre des morceaux que l'on appreciait 20 ans plus tôt sur des disques Vinyl !!
5,"Cet album n'a jamais reçu la reconnaissance qu'il mérite. C'est une petite pépite de rock frais et varié, sans aucun morceau à jeter. Difficile de résister à des tubes tels que ""On your Radio"" ou ""I'm The Man"", à l'intro de basse de ""Friday"" ou à la délicatesse de ""It's Different For Girls"". Quant aux paroles, je les trouve beaucoup plus intéressantes que ce qu'un des autres commentaires pourrait laisser croire. Tantôt revanchard (""On Your Radio""), tantôt cynique (""I'm The Man""), tantôt sentimental (""It's Different For Girls""), Joe Jackson tente d'exorciser son mal-être et sa frustation à travers des textes qui ne nuisent jamais à la fraîcheur des compositions. Au final, mon album préféré du grand Joe, devant Look Sharp, Big World et autres Night and Day."
5,"Précisons tout d'abord que ce coffret n'est que le premier volume d'une intégrale de la musique de Joseph Haydn.           Je tiens à saluer très bas cette initiative de Brilliant Classics, qui saisit l'opportunité du 200ème anniversaire de la mort de Haydn (en 1809) pour publier la première intégrale.          Joseph Haydn est un compositeur qui a produit une oeuvre considérable et d'une qualité exceptionnelle. Ce qui est particulièrement remarquable, c'est que parmi les 110 symphonies qu'il a écrites, les plus belles sont les dernières, parmi les 60 sonates  qu'il a composées, les plus belles sont aussi les dernières, et l'on peut faire la même constatation dans chacun des domaines de l'activité créatrice du compositeur, ce qui montre que Haydn n'a pas cessé de perfectionner son art tout au long de sa vie ; pour cette raison, on peut le considérer comme un maître  et un modèle : progresser jusqu'à son dernier souffle ne devrait-il pas être l'aspiration de tout être humain ?              Je n'ai évidemment pas encore écouté tous les CDs de ce coffret, j'ai écouté toutes les symphonies, un disque de chants écossais et un disque de trios avec baryton: ces interprétations sont franchement bonnes. Il n'y a vraiment pas à hésiter.              J'ajoute que la présentation du coffret, pour être minimale, est particulièrement pratique, ce qui est très important pour une collection de disques aussi nombreuse : le couvercle du boîtier est articulé et il n'y a pas à manipuler le coffret; à l'intérieur du couvercle figure la liste des Cds et de leur contenu; chaque CD est emballé dans un étui en carton au dos duquel est écrit le détail des oeuvres, des plages (minutages) et des interprètes; de plus les étuis cartonnés sont de couleurs différentes (une couleur pour les sonates , une pour les quatuors...)ce qui rend l'accés à l'oeuvre souhaitée trés rapide . Bravo Brilliant Classics! Vivement la suite!     J'ajoute, le 23 /02/09, qu'en achetant ce coffret, je n'étais pas particulièrement intéressé par les quatuors à cordes car je les avais déjà tous, dans d'excellentes interprétations (quatuors Mosaïques, Kocian, Prazak, Amadeus et Festetics) et même en plusieurs versions pour l'opus 76. Par curiosité, j'ai néanmoins décidé d'écouter le premier CD consacré aux quatuors...et ce premier CD m'a tout de suite donné envie d'écouter tous les autres : j'ai découvert des interprétations parfaitement maitrisées et intensément habitées, des interprètes (le quatuor Buchberger) qui n'hésitent pas à jouer les allegros avec fougue et qui savent prendre leur temps pour mettre en valeur toute la richesse et la profondeur des adagios. Les écouter est vraiment passionnant! Ce faisant, on mesure quelle magnifique succession de chefs d'oeuvre Haydn nous a laissée; tout amateur du quatuor à cordes se DOIT de les écouter TOUS."
5,"Une lecture magnifique de ces deux concertos, Claudio ARRAU ne se contente pas de jouer le texte,il fait ressortir la part émotionnelle contenue derrière chaque phrase.Sa sonorité profonde,massive et toujours d'une extraordinaire clarté rendent à ces deux concertos la force tragique ,la vitalité et cette grâce dont elle souffre parfois.Et surtout il n'y a jamais de démonstration pianistique,et la technique accomplie de Claudio Arrau est toujours au service de ce qu'il y a de plus profond dans ces pages si belles.De plus la collaboration avec Giulini est remarquable, et nous entendons un piano uni à l'orchestre, car trop souvent on ressent une dualité,ou un orchestre se contentant d'accompagner ce qui devient très vite insupportable... Une magnifique version à recommander à tous et à découvrir de toute urgence!!!"
5,"Peu de mots pour décrire un tel album sinon de le qualifier de véritable chef d'oeuvre.Rémy Zéro parvient à créér son propre univers,et mélange avec talent différents styles et tempo le tout accompagné de sa voix hors du commun.Cet album est un incontournable du moment et ce groupe est certainement la relève pop rock de U2 koikil s'en distingue également de par une véritable personnalité.Tous les titres sont extrememt travaillés ,meme les solos à la guitare.Un tres bon moment!!"
4,"C'est LA compilation que je conseillerais à toute personne curieuse de découvrir la musique soul funk. C'est en effet une bonne entrée en matière puisqu'on retrouve aussi bien des artistes phares (James Brown, Kool &amp; the gang, Earth wind &amp; fire, Isaac Hayes) que d'autres également incontournables et pourtant méconnus du grand public (Ann Peebles, Syl Johnson, O.V Wright, Curtis Mayfield). Un très bon achat ! Laissez-vous tenter..."
1,"Un titre qui exprime parfaitement le regret et l'admiration que j'éprouve à l'égard de Syd Barrett, ce génie de la pop qui a préféré perdre l'esprit plutôt que de continuer à se trainer les 3 ou 4 autres incapables. Waters et ses obscènes épanchements sur des souffrances de milliardaire , Averell Gilmour, ce pénible guitariste et ces interminables coulées visqueuses, Wright le moins mauvais parce-que le moins impliqué dans ces pitoyables ""oeuvres"" et le clown Mason qui compte ses ferrari pendant qu'il joue, puisqu'il n'a pas à se préoccuper du tempo : c'est toujours le même! Aucun talent chez ces demi-dieux sinon celui de se moquer du monde! Tu nous manques, Syd..."
2,"Album réalisé à l'occasion de la 1ere reformation du goupe et d'une tournée ""alimentaire"" au Japon (la destination à la mode de l'époque), celui-ci démontre clairement que la magie a disparu."
5,C'était la première fois que je commandais sur amazone et j'ai été satisfaite de mon achat. Le cd est arrivé en très bon état et la musique biensur est géniale.
1,"Je voudrais d'abord réagir sur le commentaire que je viens de lire ci-dessous. Je ne trouve pas du tout que la batterie est ""FROIDE"" ni même ""martial""...Au contraire, le batteur joue avec un feeling presque jazzy, caractéristique des batteurs de rock de l'époque. Bon, c'est pas du Mitch Mitchell et encore moins du Keith Moon mais ça reste un style de batterie trés chaleureux qui contraste justement (et heureusement) avec la froideur du ""Siméon"". Globalement, la musique de Silver Apples est assez... Tribale. Simeon ce sert de son instrument plus pour installer un climat sonore que de manière mélodique (à l'exception peut-être du titre ""confusion"")... En fait, la seule chose vraiment mélodieuse dans cet album, c'est la voix de Simeon. Mais là non plus, ne vous attendez pas à des prouesses, sa manière de chanter est vraiment un compromis entre le language parlé et le chant...Si on peut appeler ça du chant. Il y'a peut-être quelques rares moments de l'album où Simeon cherche à s'exprimer de manière mélodieuse avec son instrument (comme le ""solo"" à la fin du titre ""Fantasies""...Qui est truffés de fausses notes et de dissonances)... Mais pour la plupart des titres, le Simeon est surtout là pour installer un climat et des effets sonores. Je trouve qu'il n'y'a que 4 titres qui sortent un peu du lot : -Oscillations (sans doute la moins ennuyeuse). -Lovefingers (qui progresse de manière intéressante mais devient ennuyeuse à la longue) -Program (Simeon incorpore des samples de morceaux de musiques et d'émissions de radio qui donnent leur particularité au morceau. S'il n'y'avait pas ces samples, ce morceau serait d'un ennui terrible.) -Confusion (morceau qui porte bien son titre. Simeon à samplé un morceau de country avec un passage au banjo et superpose ses samples créant une espèce de country-music un peu bancale et déjantée). Sans doute une expérience intéressante et innovante à l'époque mais pas grand chose d'harmonieux et d'accrocheur à mon goût."
5,"""Wind and wuthering"" est certainement l'album de Genesis le plus complexe, musicalement parlant... Alors, cette nouvelle édition remixée à partir des bandes masters originales se devait enfin de rendre hommage à cette musique dans les moindres détails. Le pari est réussi et le résultat spectaculaire ! On redécouvre vraiment cet album, aussi bien en 5.1 sur son système home-cinema qu'en stéréo au casque. Les mille arrangements des 9 titres ressortent définitivement mieux et les balances graves-médiums et médiums-aïgus sont enfin rétablies (c'était le défaut majeur des éditions de 1994). La musique a retrouvé une énergie nouvelle (même ""Your own special way"", titre molasson par excellence, a gagné en vigueur...) et, cette fois, les partitions de Banks et Hackett sont superbement réparties sur le spectre sonore global de chaque chanson. Les grands titres de ce merveilleux album sont devenus un vrai régal : - ""Eleventh earl of mar"" a gagné en puissance (la frappe de Collins et le martellement de Rutherford à la basse) et l'intermède central acoustique typiquement ""hackettien"" fait complètement ressortir ce morceau. - ""One for the vine"", véritable épopée spectaculaire d'un Banks au sommet de son art, devient un chef-d'oeuvre aux arrangements raffinés et millimétrés. - ""Blood on the rooftops"" et sa guitare est magnifiée au plus haut point. - la trilogie finale ""Unquiet slumbers.../In that quiet earth/Afterglow"" conclut magnifiquement cet album, le dernier avec Steve Hackett que l'on a pourtant jamais autant entendu et dont le potentiel créatif a enfin été exploité (malgré deux titres rejetés par le groupe et publiés plus tard sur son album solo). Les bonus du DVD étant assez maigres (des extraits vidéos de piètre qualité et des interviews comfortant les idées reçues sur cet album), c'est le côté sonore de cet album qu'il faut privilégier. Personnellement, j'ai un petit regret ou plutôt un choix contestable ! Genesis a préféré regrouper tous les morceaux inédits enregistrés et les publier ensemble dans le cadre de magnifiques coffrets au lieu de les mettre en bonus de chaque album. J'aurais bien voulu qu'un morceau comme ""Inside and out"", enregistré à la même époque, figure à la suite des autres titres car il y a vraiment sa place... En tout cas, ne boudons pas notre plaisir : cette édition est magnifique, surpassant complètement toutes les autres et, malgré un abord initial assez difficile, cet album fait partie du podium des meilleurs albums du groupe."
5,"En 1995, Saga paraît oublié... Malgré une reformation du ""classic line-up"" et 2 albums studios, le groupe semblait en mal d'inspiration, se contentant de proposer des morceaux certes agréables mais tellement loin de l'inspiration du début des années 80... Cet opus, leur treizième album, est un concept-album et remet toutes les pendules à l'heure ! Le concept est bien installé dès le début avec la présentation de différents thèmes qui seront reproduits tout au long de l'album dans des arrangements améliorés, retravaillés avec des paroles évidemment racontant l'histoire de Sam... Sans rentrer dans l'histoire proprement dite, je trouve les paroles assez travaillées (cela n'avait jamais été le point fort du groupe) mais c'est la musique qui révélera toute sa saveur au cours des écoutes. Tout le monde est à l'unisson, les guitares sont bien présentes mais pas trop, les sons de claviers dont un piano rarement utilisé par Saga et un orgue très vintage également, le concept prend la sauce et passe très bien tout au long des 25 plages de l'album. Steve Negus est peut-être en retrait mais la production est impeccable. Certes, le concept n'est pas aussi prenant qu'un ""The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway"" ou ""The Wall"" mais le groupe a su éviter le piège de la longueur et concentrer magnifiquement ses idées. Dommage que le groupe n'ait pas poursuivi dans cette voie et que l'album (ou des extraits) n'ait quasiment jamais été joué en concert depuis la tournée de promotion. Cette ré-édition avec un titre bonus en concert datant de 1998 permet de savourer cet album, le plus progressif au sens même du terme de la carrière du groupe !"
2,"Attiré par les nombreuses bonnes et très bonnes critiques de cet album je me décide à l'acheter. Il faut dire que ça commence très fort (Ah, cet intro piano....) et puis ça décolle vraiment très très haut......et patatrac. Donc pour faire court et sans être méchant : le chant c'est vraiment pas possible: 92% d'effets et 8% de platitude pour une ligne vocale qui ne décolle jamais....c'est au delà de mes forces. Ensuite, il y a cet erreur fatale : le rock-progressif même dans son versant métal, ça doit être......progressif. Là on tourne en rond. Il est donc très difficile de s'emballer pour un tel pétard mouillé. Et pourtant, cet intro piano....."
5,"et incontournable ! Impossible de ne pas noter encore et encore la voix terriblement sublime de Layne ... we die young, love hate love, man in the box... très évocateurs ! Et de relever cette sempiternelle et délicieuse lourdeur mélodieuse des guitare, basse et batterie..."
5,"Cette album et au-dessus de tout ce qui existe. Ces gens sont des extraterrestres. Cette musique n'existe que sur cette album et nulle part ailleurs. Je n'ai jamais ré-entendu quelque chose de semblable*** .....Tous les ans, je le récoute et je me prends une baffe comme à sa sortie, il y a dix ans. Pour son anniversaire, j'ai décidé de lui rendre hommage ~.|.~"
2,"J'attendais beaucoup de ce groupe... la rythmique de Rage avec le leader d'un des groupes les plus forts de la scène de Seattle. J'adore RATM pour son groove, ses riffs tronçonnants, ses envolées verbales, j'adore Soundgarden, pour leurs mélodies inégalées, j'imaginais le meilleur d'une telle réunion, de la part de tels musiciens. Morello est pour moi presque l'égal d'un Hendrix par son jeu novateur, l'utilisation qu'il fait de sa guitare (la technique et l'improvisation en moins bien sûr). Le batteur est un bon cogneur également. Et que dire de Cornell, un song writer exceptionnel doublé d'un excellent chanteur ? Comme quoi, le talent ne suffit pas, il faut aussi de l'envie, et là rien de bon ou presque n'en ressort, juste un disque bien formaté qui passe sans problème à la radio... beuark ! Et dire qu'un deuxième album est en cours..."
5,"One Hot minute est bien sur le meilleur red hot et il est stupide d'y voir un disque de métal. C'est leur disque le plus risqué et original à ce jour, mieux que le répétitif Blood sugar... et le bon mais inégal Californication. Bien que fan de Frusciante, je dois admettre que Navarro fait tres bien son boulot, Chad Smith et Flea étant plus en forme que jamais. Un classique des années 90"
1,"Quelle déception! Ou sont les frères Ashton? Ça fait des lustres que le père Iggy n'a rien proposé de décent, les albums beat em up et skull ring nous ont prévenu: un son commercial a mort, des textes pathétiques, Iggy se vautre dans des productions qu'il estime ""actuelles"" (collaboration avec sum 41...quelle misère).Ce qui l'a reconduit a reformer les Stooges c'est simplement la demande plus l'aura légendaire du combo acquise de longue date. Le résultat un album de rock pré pubère avec le gang ashton muselé par l'iguane, un son affligeant, très ""MTV"", très américain (dans le pire sens du terme, c'est a dire calculateur a mort, ultra formaté).Bref aucune âme, un sentiment de dégout dès la première écoute,plus que largement confirmée aujourd'hui! Une insulte au passé, Iggy est un mercenaire, il se fout de notre gueule et ce depuis un bail! Je l'ai estimé et respecté pendant trop longtemps, il faut se faire une raison ce type n'a aucun talent de composition, il ne sais que passer a la caisse."
5,"Si Iggy Pop retrouve aujourd'hui ses compères des STOOGES, c'est qu'on ne s'est pas vraiment remis de cette bombe que furent les STOOGES en leur temps. Personnellement je vous dirait que ces retrouvailles ne valent pas grand chose et que c'est encore à l'original qu'il vaut mieux se référer. Alors là, aucune hésitation, je vous conseille le fulgurant, le chaotique FUN HOUSE. Iggy avait voulu avec cet album recréer en studio l'énergie et le chao engendré par les STOOGES sur scène. C'est de la pure folie et c'est toujours aussi sombre et dément 33 ans après ! Un disque inégalé et brulant. Un véritable coup de poing lancé à la face de la société américaine alors en plein marasme (déjà ! à l'époque c'était la guerre du Viet Nam).  Un morceau d'anthologie de la contre-culture américaine. Et la contre-culture est la seule bonne chose qui nous vienne des USA. On ne peut pas passer à côté de chef-d'œuvre ""démoralisateur"" !"
5,"Qui a vu un petit hardos de 1978 exploser litéralement de bonheur à l'écoute de ce petit groupe inconnu sorti des clubs de L.A. par GENE SIMMONS?...Oui, on chantait à en pleurer et on mimait VAN HALEN avec notre pelle en carton...inoubliable...et surtout inégalable...Runnin' With The Devil.. Eruption ... You Really Got Me  Écouter... Ain't Talkin'bout Love   ...I'm The One...Jamie's Crying... Atomic Punk...Feel Your Love Tonight... Little Dreamer...Ice Cream Man  Écouter... On Fire...et voilà comment en un peu moins de 36 minutes les frères VAN HALEN et Mr.D.L.ROTH changèrent le monde du ROCK et celui de la guitare électrique à jamais, avec du bric-à-brac(guitare bricolée de toute pièce) et énormément de TALENT...c'est tout!"
4,"Avant la folie Disco de Dynasty, KISS s'était fait plaisir avec cet album varié et réussi. Les imparables Shock Me, I Stole Your love et Love Gun deviendront des valeurs sûre en live. Peter Criss et Ace Frehley trouvent davantage leur place dans le travail de composition et au chant (Hooligan / Shock Me) face à l'omniprésence de la paire Stanley/Simmons mais les tensions internes existent et conduiront aux 4 albums solos de 1978... Dommage néanmoins que la reprise discutable de Then She Kissed Me vienne gâcher la fin de l'album !"
2,"Ayant eu le bonheur de vivre le concert de Bercy, j'attendais cet album avec impatience...et patatra! Le mix privilégie les cris dans la foules aux compositions et on a vraiment le sentiment d'avoir un album enregistré au milieu de la foule avec un minidisc avec les relous qui sifflent tout le temps...des bruits de foule de temps en temps, normal pour un live, mais tout le temps c'est tout simplement gavant et ça empêche de se laisser aller sur le son...bref je mets 2 étoiles pour la qualité de ces compos gâchées par un parti pris catastrophique dans le mixage"
5,"S'il ne vous faut qu'un album de métal, c'est celui-ci. Violent, précis, incontournable, sans pour autant être sale ou minimaliste, ""Reign in Blood"" est un bijou où chaque composition s'enchaîne brutalement avec la suivante sans pour autant laisser l'auditeur sur sa faim. La demi-heure que vous procure cette album n'est pas un moment de lassitude ou d'interrogations, non. C'est probablement la demi-heure la plus avancée musicalement que vous pourrez apprécier et ce, encore 23 ans après la sortie de cet incontournable chef d'oeuvre. Slayer manquait de maturité avant, et est devenu moins spontané après, donc cet album est la quintessence de leur immortel art. Par ailleurs, et pour des raisons qui me sont inconnues, ""Reign In Blood"" sonne beaucoup mieux en CD qu'en MP3."
4,"Le seul live de Supertramp digne de ce nom (Rick Davis sans Roger Hodgson mais sous le nom de Supertramp fera quelques années plus tard un live ""Live 88"" calamiteux, puis il y a peu un ""It Was The Best Of Times"" pas très excitant. On retiendra de ce très bon double album enregistré à Paris (le concert du Pavillon de 1980) un son étonnament proche d'un album studio, un inédit - You Started Laughing - et une version accélérée et réussie de Dreamer. De quoi faire un tour rapide des meilleurs titres de ce groupe mytique."
2,"Le problème est le même que pour ""Tommy"" : je trouve que les Who ne tiennent pas la route sur quatre face d'affillées. Même si cet album conceptuel par d'une idée intéressante, l'idée de base se pert dans divers style : hard, country, prod rock... plus des synthé vilains partout ! L'innovation de ce disque est que Keith Moon, Roger Dailtrey et John Entwistle composent ( ce qui n'est pas vraiment une bonne idée, même pour Entwistle )  Enfin pour compléter la débandade : le mixage est raté ( c'est Townshend qui la dit )"
2,"Etrange cas que ce ""Transformer"" que presque tout le monde apprécie, qui fût un gros succès commercial à sa sortie et donna le seul hit de la carrière de Lou Reed, ""Walk on the wild side"". Deuxième album solo, il était produit par David Bowie et son complice Mick Ronson; leur but: aider une ex-star underground (accessoirement une de idoles de l'Anglais) devenue totalement has-been à réemerger, en utilisant pour cela la vague glam alors en plein déferlement.      Et de fait, le matériel du New-Yorkais est très bon; la qualité de chansons comme ""Vicious"" ou ""Perfect Day"" est évidente, conforme en cela au talent énorme d'un des meilleurs songwriters de sa génération. Le problème vient de l'habillage sonore voulu par Bowie et Ronson, tant au niveau des arrangements que de la production. L'équipe applique ici les recettes gagnantes de ""Hunky Dory"": or, si cela convenait très bien à l'esthétisme et à la sophistication de Bowie, cela dessert beaucoup les titres de ce disque, tant Reed avait su devenir un spécialiste du sarcasme et de la méchanceté (y compris dans les ballades). C'est notamment vrai dans les guitares, auparavant élément essentiel, ici complétées ou supplantées par des saxos, conterbasses, violons...  Le résultat, peu convaincant, s'affirme encore si on compare deux versions de ""Satellite of love"": dans celle de l'album, ballade lente pour piano et choeurs, l'ensemble reste trop cotonneux et dégagé; dans la version qui figure sur le coffret ""Peel slowly and see"" par la dernière incarnation du Velvet Underground, on trouve une chanson épurée et dynamique, chantée par un Lou à bloc, et qui atteint en 3 minutes chrono une sorte de sommet de la pop music toutes époques confondues.  De toute façon, Lou Reed déteste cet album (pas ses chansons). On peut le comprendre: la plupart du temps, on a l'impression de l'entendre faire de son mieux pour imiter David Bowie. Dommage."
5,"Incomparable Dylan. Si d'aventure vous ne connaissez pas l'oeuvre du père Zimmermann, ce double -album est la porte d'entrée obligatoire. Tout le génie de ce poète incomparable y prend sa véritable ampleur. Après cela, plus rien n'a été pareil."
5,"Je ne trouve pas de mots pour decrire cette bombe musicale à part peut-être.....imaginez un martien débarquant sur terre et cherchant un concentré de bonne humeur, de folie, de fraicheur, d'hystérie, de tristesse, de peur, d'amour, d'humour,d'énérgie, de magie, d'émotions et de pulssions sexuelles tout en ayant l'impression d'être toujours dans l'espace...Ben c'est simple : le petit alien rentrerais chez lui avec un exemplaire de Doolittle et l'univers tout entier danserais sur Here Comes Your Man."
2,"Ringo Starr a essayé de refaire le coup de son précédent album 'Ringo'. Pour cela : 'with a little help from my friends', ses amis lui ont fourni quelques bonnes compositions originales. Ici, meme si Ringo (co-)compose 3 titres, on trouve encore Lennon qui lui donne la chanson titre ""Goodnight Vienna"", Elton John avec ""Snookeroo"" et bien d'autres... Le résultat est honnete, tout en étant moins brillant que pour l'album 'Ringo'."
1,"Aimez vous le Blues, la Country ?  Aimez vous la voix de Ringo Starr ? Alors c'est bien parti... En 1970, Ringo décide de consacrer un disque à ce genre de musique qu'il affectionne particulièrement. Il se fait assisté de musiciens qui sont la crème de ce qui faisait à l'époque dans la musique Country/Blues.  Il ne chante ici que des compositions originales données par certains des musiciens qui l'accompagnent.  Que dire d'autre? Peut être que c'est intéressant  pour découvrir ce genre de musique..."
4,"Après cinq années de silence John Lennon revient en 1980 avec cet album qui sortira quelques semaines seulement avant son tragique assassinat. Petite particularité : sa compagne Yoko Ono est aussi présente et « Double Fantasy » est construit sur une sorte de dialogue, avec une alternance des chansons de John et de Yoko. Dire que seules les chansons de John ont de la valeur est en fait inexact. Certes, les « Just like starting over », les « Woman » et autres « Watching the Wheel» sont autant de chefs-d'œuvre à ranger à côté de « Instant Karma » ou « God » par exemple, mais cela ne doit pas nous faire oublier les performances de Yoko Ono non plus. Bien entendu, l'on est en droit de ne pas aimer, voire d'y être allergique, mais tout de même les compositions, si elles n'atteignent effectivement pas le génie de celles de Lennon, sont honorables : « I'm moving on », « Every man has a woman who loves him » et « Hard times are over » l'attestent.  En définitive, ce n'est sans doute pas le meilleur album de John Lennon, mais il demeure tout de même tout à fait convaincant et magique par moment, malgré la grande diversité des styles."
1,"La vedette de ce disque n'est pas Stills (pour lequel j'ai personnellement une estime infinie) mais bel et bien Bloomfield!!! DEBOUCHEZ-VOUS LES OREILLES!!! Là sont quelques-unes des plus belles parties de guitare jamais enregistrées par un guitariste de cette génération!!! Mike B. ayant, avec Al Kooper-faut-il vous le rappeler- participé à la réussite planétaire et éternelle de ""Like a Rolling Stone"", Stills et consort ne sont que de très talentueux seconds rôles dans cette affaire. Il faut connaître l'histoire de Kooper et Bloomfield avant de se risquer à des commentaires ou des analyses, chers nouveaux critiques. Mais, bravo, ce qui est le plus important c'est d'écouter Super Session, chef-d'oeuvre intégral célébré depuis sa sortie. Ensuite, allez donc voir avant, du côté du Paul Butterfield Blues Band, et allez-donc voir la suite, du côté de l'Electric Flag. Ainsi, vous saurez pourquoi vous ferez   toujours brûler une petite bougie pour Mike Bloomfield. J.Chabiron."
5,"""Rocks"" est le meilleur album d'Aerosmith. Aerosmith est de Boston. Boston, le groupe de Tom Scholtz chante ""Let me take you home tonight"" et Aerosmith ""Home tonight"" tout court et c'est une formidable conclusion reposante après un tel effort. Pour sûr, ils sont dopés, Tom Hamilton en tête. Expliquez-moi comment il fait pour suivre Joe Perry dans ses dérapages et autres accélérations aussi soudaines que dangereuses. ""Lick and a promise"" annonce le stratosphérique album de 1977 : ""Draw the line"". N'est-il pas curieux par ailleurs de trouver dans cet écrin de somptueuses oeillades en direction des aînés ? ""Nobody's fault"" en direction du Légendaire Dirigeable en plein chant du cygne avec le ""Presence"" millésimé 1976... tout comme ce ""Rocks"" aussi noir que la pochette d'Hypnogis est blanche, vous croyez à une coïncidence, vous ?"
5,"Apres avoir attendu sa reimpression pendant 30 ans,je peut enfin a nouveau entendre les sonoritées si particuliere de ce groupe qui 1 an avant Led zep a invente le metal,le second album nettement moins bon entrainera malheuresement la disparition du groupe,dommage,mais qu'est ce que c'etait bon ce debut des 70's."
5,"après bien des déboires avec les heartbreakers,johnny décide de faire un ep solo.quelle réussite!!!ce disque est sublime.il cotoie la perfection avec des titres comme ""(she's so) untouchable""et d'autres encore.aidé par des pointures comme Phil lynnot ou Chrissie Hynde,Johnny nous prouve qu'il est un musicien hors norme."
5,"Quand Iggy et ses compères ont enregistré Raw Power, la maison de disque a en quelque sorte opposé son véto à la sortie de l'album. Alors, David Bowie a remixé l'album pour qu'il paraisse moins sauvage. Et le classique a circulé durant plus de deux décénnies sous cette forme là. Quand Iggy Pop a repris en main le mixage de cet album désormais mythique, on pouvait s'attendre donc à retrouver une sauvagerie un peu perdue. Et c'est bien le cas !!!!! Dans le nouveau mix, l'album sonne encore plus proche des premiers albums du groupe, et les morceaux comme ""search and destroy"" ou ""I need somebody"" méritent ENFIN le son qu'on osait espérer depuis des années. L'album était déjà un indispensable; avec le remix d'Iggy, il devient une pierre angulaire du rock 70's."
5,"Des Beatles qui reprendraient Bob Dylan (1/3 des compositions du vinyle original sont signées Zimmerman) est un raccourci aussi facile qu'approximatif pour qualifier les Byrds et leur musique lors de ce premier album officiel du groupe. Car si les harmonies vocales sont millimétrées, les refrains pop évidents (« I feel a whole lotta better », « All I really want to do », et le hit mondial qui donne son titre au Cd), la recherche de l'inspiration vers les thèmes du folk n'appartient qu'aux Byrds. Les Beatles ont créé un idiome musical  (la pop) en partant de rien, tandis que les Byrds se reposent sur toute une tradition musicale américaine (ici le folk, dans quelques années la country). Modernes  (morceaux électrifiés avant le « scandale » Dylan à Newport) et traditionalistes à la fois, les Byrds sont un des groupes les plus importants de la musique américaine. Et ce premier Cd est indispensable, livrant le groupe dans ses originelles simplicité et pureté, avant que les ego surdimensionnés des musiciens s'affrontent et que la musique aille, sous l'effet de substances diverses, explorer et inventer d'autres paysages musicaux."
2,"En fan de glam, j'ai été très surpris par ce disque de ""plastic soul"". Si ce disque fut le premier disque de blanc a entrer dans les hit-parades noir, il n'a pas su me seduire. Mais bon, sans doute je m'attendais à trop de ce disque... Ce qui est certain, c'est qu'il rompt totalement avec les précédants albums que j'adore pourtant!!!"
5,"La quintescence guitaristique par excellence. Clapton &amp; Allman au top. Indispensable dans toute discothèque dédiée au blues, à écouter en boucle."
4,"Cet album phare de l'année 1976 renaît grâce à ce nouveau support ; un grand merci au producteur original Bill Szymcyz qui s'est associé au spécialiste de la remasterisation 5.1 Elliot Scheiner ( à qui l'on doit le superbe remix de Queen ; A Night in Opera ) Une bonne surprise vous attend en découvrant cet album car une piste DTS est présente alors qu'elle n'est pas mentionnée sur la jaquette . En revanche , seule les paroles du titre phare du DVD sont présentes , pouquoi pas les autres ? De même que l'interview de 6' de Bill Szyncyk aurait mérité un sous titrage . Dans l'ensemble cet album est excellent et le format DVD AUDIO aide à l'apprécier davantage ."
5,"un look improbable, une culture musicale incroyable, on retouve Dylan, Cohen, et plus moderne aussi, l'album est génial"
5,"On l'attendait, Jean-Louis l'a fait! Cet album est plus plus abouti, le plus séduisant et le plus simple. Jean-Louis Aubert va à l'essentiel et nous le dit!"
2,"Et non. Ca se veut la plupart du temps joyeux, fanfaronnant, et en plein dans la vague de la nouvelle scène française. OK. Admettons.Mais après? Que dire par exemple des textes? La plupart les décrivent comme touchant et 'révélateur de nos petits travers quotidiens' C'est très à la mode de penser ça des nouveaux artistes semble t'il... Prenons l'exemple de 'dis lui oui'(Chanson particulièrement enervante en l'occurence) En quoi est ce drole? En quoi cela devrait il nous ammener à sourire?  ""les poèmes de 5 pages après il me les lit..."" Ca vous fait rire vous? Désolé, moi pas.  Mais le pire chez cet artiste se situe dans sa pseudo approche minimaliste. Citons quelques passages du fameux 'monospace' titre apprécié des fans:""parfois je m'imagine sur la route des vacances en bon chef de famille au volant d'un monospace. Avec un cercle en plastique on appuie dessus ça sort ça fait porte gobelet. Et un truc très pratique pour ranger les pièces de monnaie..."" Ecoute Benabar, si tu ne te sens pas à l'aise avec ce genre d'écriture n'hésites pas à laisser un certain Vincent Delerm s'en charger. Lui se débrouille plutot bien... Mais ce n'est pas tout! le bougre continue: ""Meme si elle menace, me supplie à genoux, je n'irais pas manger une glace avec un pull autour du cou."" Ah bon? Parce que c'est censé faire preuve de mauvais gout? Désolé pour ceux qui mangent des glaces avec un pull autour du cou mais chez benabar ça ne semble pas etre toléré... On pourrait au moins espérer que les mélodies rattrapent ces excès de suffisance, et bien... Non. SAUF pour quelques très rares exceptions comme sur le joli 'je suis de celles' qui constitue à mon sens l'unique réussite de l'artiste. J'invite donc à se méfier de ces faux talents que l'on a peut etre un peu trop tendance à faire passer pour des 'révolutionnaires de la chanson' alors qu'ils en sont encore bien loin. Ecoutez Bénabar une fois et faites vous votre propre avis. Quoi qu'il en soit ce live ne rattrape absolument rien. Comparez avec Delerm, votre choix sera très vite fait..."
5,"Tantôt Boris Vian,tantôt Boby Lapointe, mais toujours accompagné par Django."
5,"Ce disque est génial ! ! Tous les n°1 des Beatles en 1 seul disque... super !.. oui, enfin bon... hum ! ... Etant  une exegete, je me demande pourquoi en effet "" strawberry fields.. "", pourquoi "" please please me "" qui fut n°1 n'est pas là, "" don't let me down "" qui avec "" get back "" formait un double 'A-side' n'est pas la... alors ? Bon, la réponse est simple... Parce qu'il n'y a pas la place de tout mettre sur un seul CD et quitte a eliminer certaines chansons autant supprimer des morceaux moins accessibles pour ne laisser que les plus commerciaux... car le but supreme ici c'est de faire 1 seul CD avec un maximum de bonnes chansons...  Car 'one' c est quoi ? soit disant la compilation de tous leurs 'numeros un' en single... on l'a vu ce n est pas vrai... disons  plutot que c est une tentative de best of... mais comment faire un best of quand on a fait tant de bonnes chansons... alors ? Eureka ! dans la mesure ou on sort un single parce que par definition c est une chanson qui intrinsequement seule peut avoir du succes,  il est logique de penser que les singles des beatles sont les meilleures chansons  des beatles... ce qui n est evidemment pas vrai ! !. les beatles ont sorti en moyenne 2 single par periode, on assimilera une periode a un album... et evidemment il y a eu des periodes beaucoup plus riches que d autres et des chansons geniales n ont jamais pu sortir en single ets et se trouvent uniquement sur album... on n'a donc pas ici les 27 meilleures chansons des beatles mais en gros les 2 meilleures de chaque periode... pour les matheux, on verifiera en effet que les beatles ont fait 13 albums (avec le 'white' comme double, en ne comptant pas 'yellow submarine' mais en comptant 'magical mystery tour') et donc 2*13 = 26, le compte y est presque : 2 singles par periode (d'album)... /Bien sur ! Ce disque en fait meriterait plutot le nom de... 'Anthology' . En effet, ce disque a le tres grand merite de presenter un echantillon representatif de chaque epoque beatles tout en proposant les morceaux les plus connus... car il y a les incontournables (de Mc Cartney) : "" yesterday "", "" hey jude "" "" let it be "", des 'Lennon' auxquelles on ne peut pas echapper "" hard day's night "" "" help "" "" all you need is love "" "" come together "" , il y a aussi "" yellow submarine "" chanté par Ringo Starr ou "" something "" de Harrison qui ne pouvait pas ne pas etre la. Certes Harrison aurait ete vert de ne pas avoir une de ces compositions sur l album mais de toute facon  c est quand meme une des meilleures chansons des beatles ! Au passage, on remarquera sur cette compil...on trouve beaucoup de chansons de Lennon dans la premiere partie du disque et beaucoup de chansons de Mc Cartney dans la seconde, ce qui montre bien l'influence alternative qu on eut les deux leaders du groupe... Pourquoi 'one' (quel nom nul !) alors? pourquoi ce 'beatles anthology' ? pour faire de l argent ? les beatles n en ont pas besoin... en etant mesquine, je dirais qu ils veulent tout simplement battre encore des records (de vente) et figurer encore plus haut ( ? !) au pantheon de la pop music... en etant naive et politiquement correcte, je dirais que les beatles se sont rendus compte qu'avant, pour avoir un best of du groupe il fallait acheter 4 CD : le 'double rouge' et le 'double bleu'... Ce n etait pas forcement une bonne idee car il n est pas evident d acheter 2 double (donc le prix de 4 CD) pour des gens qui voudraient s acheter ou offrir un best of. Grace a 'one' et comme son nom l indique (? ! bon sang mais c est bien sur ! !) maintenant 1 seul (bien rempli certes) suffit... c'est vrai que c est beaucoup plus judicieux ('marketingment' parlant) pour le grand public... Merci les Beatles ! le fan est ravi ! Mais de toute facon ce eième best of du groupe qui de plus fait passer a la trappe des chansons geniales pour ne garder que les plus commerciales, ca flaire l arnaque pour qui connait deja bien les beatles... Mais non ! car toutes les plages de ce CD ont été re-mas-te-ri-sees... voilà le mot cle qui fait tilt.. Et en effet pour ceux qui ont l habitude des CD 'normaux' (voire des cassettes ou des vinyls) quelle difference ! ! on se demande vraiment comment ils ont bidouille tout ca ! ! je ne dis pas que c est mieux, je dis que c est pas pareil... donc bilan : vos tantes ou vous adorez les beatles et vous avez toujours hesite a (leur/vous) offrir le best of en 4 CD (trop cher/ pas assez selectif) des beatles alors 'one' (one more time) est fait pour vous... le fan qui a deja l integrale (ou la moitie), ou le rouge et le bleu, hesite serieusement dans le style ""  on ne va pas se racheter des choses qu on a deja "", mais la vous ne l avez pas deja... il n y a aucune compilation de chansons de Beatles d un si bon niveau en CD... en plus la, c est tout remasterise... c est completement autre chose par rapport aux versions non remasterisees...bref personne n hesite... sauf moi car parmi  mes 27 chansons preferees des beatles, il n y en a que 6 ou 7 qui se trouvent sur ce CD..."
1,"Cela me fait de la peine de le dire, mais le génie de Kate Bush est cruellement absent de cet album. Les mélodies sont plates et sa voix est noyée dans des arrangements conventionnels. On ressent un manque d'énergie du début à la fin. C'est bien dommage."
1,de la variétoche jouée par des musiciens limités...et puis ce son d'orgue(toujours le même sur tous les album du groupe!)qui file la nausée.Mais comment ont-ils fait pour être signés?
2,"Sur la quarantaine de disques que ce grand artiste  a sorti, celui-ci est de loin un de ses plus mauvais. Rien a voir avec les perles de ses debuts (Abraxas, Caravanserai, Moonflower, Marathon,...) ni avec les tres bons disques de annees 90. Si vous voulez avoir un aperçu de son talent, c'est un disque a eviter..."
1,"Impression d'entendre une radio généraliste, inodore et incolore. Santana est-il derrière son robot?"
5,"c'est incontestablement le meilleur album de radiohead tout simplement parce qu'il est à l'image du groupe: torturé, complexe,mais tellement créatif et envoutant. la gestation et l'accouchement de kid a ne furent pas sans douleurs mais le résultat final est là: une experience musical éprouvante certes mais surtout emouvante et profonde. écoutez-le, vous comprendrez.et même, vous ne pourrez plus vous en passer."
1,Si radiohead est un groupe avec du talent Alors le mot musique na plus de sens Aucun des musiciens à ce jour nest reconnu pour ses talents  Le pire ce quils sont classé dans le rock prog Ce sont des amateurs avec un unnivaire bien à eux La voix du chanteur et plus que banal Il y a que les fans pour faire des éloge sur ce groupe
4,"la suite de kid a était très attendu. moins d'un an après son prédécesseur, amnesiac affiche des ambitions claires et montre que radiohead a réussi sa transition pour notre plus grand bonheur. mais que les fans de guitares se rassurent, elles sont cette fois ci plus présentes. les chansons sont épurées et moins lourdes que kid a, thom yorke est toujours aussi émouvant et l'album contient certainement les plus beaux textes qu'il ait jamais écrit. jonny greenwood, le guitariste signe aussi une belle performance avec life in a glasshouse et le groupe se permet même d'inviter le trompettiste humpfrey littleton et s'offre une cloture de première classe."
5,"Radiohead est un groupe qui se démarque des autres : le seul qui apporte vraiment du nouveau à l'art musical, le seul qui prend des risques, quitte à déplaire à l'opinion publique. Certains ont consommé trop de réchauffé, et dès qu'ils écoutent des albums peu conformistes, ça ne passe plus. Pourtant, la musique c'est avant tout l'évolution, et Radiohead n'a pas son égal aujourd'hui à ce point de vue. Concernant l'album en lui-même, il est très proche de Kid A, les morceaux ayant été composé durant la même période. Amnesiac demande une analyse profonde des morceaux, on ne perçoit pas toute la splendeur de l'album en une seule écoute. Et, on tombe vite sous le charme lorsqu'on comprend le sens de l'album. Pyramid Song est d'une beauté inouïe, Knives Out est un tube par excellence, mais le chef-d'oeuvre d'Amnesiac est sans conteste Life In A Glasshouse, absolument incroyable, aux tons jazzy, la voix de Thom est sensationnelle, peut-être dans le top 5 des meilleurs morceaux de Radiohead, car celui-ci est ahurissant, et clôt l'album de manière magistrale. Quoiqu'il en soit, on aime ou on aime pas Radiohead, mais c'est un groupe intelligent qui fait de la musique comme personne. Authentique, vrai, étonnant, que demander de plus ?"
2,"Déjà que le single était du plagiat éhonté des Talking Heads (re-écoutez ""road to nowhere""), le reste de l'album est une ressacée maladroite de la pop-folk de ces 20 dernières années. Ceux qui aimaient Dylan dans leur jeunesse vont adorer, trouver cela assez frais, mais pour moi, c'est de la soupe bien tiède. Le + drôle est dans la 3eme phase du single ""In the morning"": ""every music on the radio sounds the same..."". Quelle ironie..."
2,"pourquoi faire de cette chose un classique? cet album sent le fric et l'abus, pour un album de punk c'est le pire qu'on puisse faire! finalement on est pas si loin de la réalité sur la pochette de ""some product carri on"". a écouter au moins une fois, pour se faire une idée... mais si vous voulez entendre du punk qui vous collera la claque que vous attendez, essayez plutôt ""Fresh fruit for rotting vegetables"" des ""Dead Kennedys"" ou ""The feeding of the 5000"" de ""Crass"" ceux la méritent le nom de classique."
1,"Quelle horreur cet album! A l'époque et maintenant,il y a mieux à écouter, les Beatles par exemple. Ces années-là, il y a profusion d'inventivité pour pas mal de groupes; pourquoi  s'emcombrer d'un boulet comme le Velvet. Ca joue mal,la batterie est une casserole, ça chante mal, c'est mal composé mais comme il y a Andy dans le coin de la Factory, ça fait bien d'écouter le Velvet. Ces mecs et nanas n'ont rien fait d'autre après. Lou Reed, me direz-vous! ouais heureusement qu'il y avait Bowie  pour lui arranger son ""Walk On The Wild Side"" sinon je n'ose pas imaginer  le pire... et pas le meilleur; deux ou trois titres en plus de la mégalomanie; vous avez dèjà traduit du Loulou:quelle platitude, c'est pas croyable; si je pouvais mettre Zéro Etoile,je n'hésiterai pas. Allez  on met ça à la cave avec les toiles d'araignées et on n'en parle plus. Ouf!"
5,Ce best of est magnifique !!! Dommage qu'il n'y ait pas 6 étoiles pour évaluer ^^. CD à acheter sans réfléchir !
5,rarement vu une production et un resultat aussi impressionant !!! cet album fera je l'espere référence..... du pur luxe !! courez l'acheter...........
5,"Sonnez cornemuses et autres oliphants AC/DC débarquent et va tout bousculer! Les frères Young n'ont que faire de toutes explications philosophiques, théologiques ou sociologiques, ils sont nés pour le rock et le rock est eux.  Comme le dit souvent Angus ""nous ne savons faire que de la musique, qu'est ce que vous voulez qu'on fasse d'autres"". Alors après avoir raccourci leur parcours scolaire les voilà lancés avec leur maître à penser dynamiteur, Bon Scott, sur les routes de la destinée.  Et tous feux dehors, sans compromis, ils vont montrer au monde entier ce qu'est le Rock d'AC/DC. Mélange de blues et de rock'n'roll passée à la sauce piment. Cet album est vraiment brut, frais, sans décorum, il montre leur joie de vivre et leur passion bouillonnante. ""it's a long way to the top"" indique que malgré tout le rock est un art et avant d'arriver à leur niveau il faut du travail et de la compréhension. ""the jack"" montre l'humour et la joie de Bon scott. ""live wire"" nous électrise sur place. ""T.N.T"" est un hymne, un morceau emblématique. ""can I sit next to you girl"" est un hymne à l'amour. ""high voltage"" termine en beauté l'album en montrant une dernière fois l'énergie spectaculaire du groupe. AC/DC était né, et jusqu'à présent comme les jardins suspendus de Babylone, le phare d'Alexandrie, les pyramides de Kéops...ils sont une des merveilles du monde humain."
5,"Dévastateur !!! L'effet que produit les morceaux de ce disque est irrésistible. Et j'insiste là-dessus, c'est ce qu'ils ont fait de meilleur. La fausse chanson d'amour ""Big Balls"", ôde à la petite amie bien burnée, est la meilleure de toute leur aeuvre. Et ""Rocker"", ""dirty deeds..."", etc., sont de gros concentrés d'énergie purement rock n'roll, comme savaient les pondre en d'autre temps Little Richard ou Gene Vincent ! Sauf que c'est ACDC, les petits frères de la décadence, et qu'ils foutent le feu comme des petits punks. Même leur superbe blues, ""ride on"", est d'une sincérité, d'une spontanéité bouleversante. C'était quand ACDC chantaient dans la joie, mettaient le feu, et n'avaient rien à perdre.  Voilà le disque qui leur a valu d'être un des plus grands groupes de rock du monde. Celui qui ferait ça aujourd'hui collectionnerait les lauriers de la presse rock... sauf que c'est 30 ans trop tard."
5,"Qui de nos jours, n'a jamais entendu ou fredonné cette chanson nommée ""Highway To Hell"" ? Si vous lisez ce commentaire et que vous dîtes que ce n'est pas le cas ! Soit vous faîtes preuve de mauvaise foi ou bien vous avez passé les 40 dernières années de votre vie perdu sur une île deserte !!! Ce disque date de 1979 et il semble toujours aussi intemporel. Le line-up Australien est au sommet de son art à cet époque et nous pond une merveille qui sera également le dernier album du chanteur Bon Scott ! 10 titres, 10 tubes. Rien à jeter sur cet album !!! Je dirais même que c'est musicalement diabolique: Comme à l'accoutumée chez AC/DC, tout repose sur un riff simple mais qui fait mouche aux oreilles à chaque fois et c'est tellement efficace que l'on en redemande même après l'avoir écouté ! C'est à se demander si le malin en personne, ne s'est pas invité sur les 10 tracks de cet album !"
5,"Et bien OUI !! Encore des p'tits jeunes plein d'énergie, de bons vieux riffs, de good ol'Rock ! J'adore ! Et pour les désabusés, les spécialistes de la comparaison, les ténors du moindre : lavez-vous les oreilles et mettez-y autant d'ardeur que ces p'tits gars là !!"
2,"Fan depuis la première heure du plus grand groupe anglais de la décennie (avec leur ennemis Blur et Radiohead), cet album fut une vraie déception. Noel répète souvent que c'est le pire album du groupe (et c'est suffisamment rare de sa part de reconnaitre ses erreurs pour être noté) et tous les fans s'accordent à dire qu'ils ont joué la facilité: trop Beatles, trop plagiat. Trop de drogue, trop d'alcool, et pas assez de travail, selon le Chief lui-même. Les seuls bon morceaux à retenir sont ""D'ya know what i mean?"", ""Stand By Me"" et ""All around the world"".  Après cet album, Noel a décidé de lacher la drogue et l'alcool, est parti s'isoler à la campagne, et le groupe est revenu avec un vrai bon album: ""Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants"".  Donc ne vous fiez pas à cet album pour juger Oasis, ce groupe à bien plus de talent que cet album ne le laisse paraitre. Faite l'impasse sur celui-ci, mais écoutez absolument les autres, notament ""Definitely Maybe"" qui a réveillé le rock anglais au moment où on le croyait mort."

1,"Les chef d'oeuvres musicaux existent, c'est certain sinon il n'y aurait jamais de note maximale. Mais à l'autre bout de la chaîne alimentaire, on trouve d'autres production de qualité : les nanards. Soit de la musique particulièrement nulle, mais en même temps particulièrement drôle. Ceux-là récoltent entre 2 et 3 étoiles, voir 4 si je suis dans un bon jour. Mais, tout en bas de l'échelle de richter, il y a les navets. Soit des albums suffisamment nuls pour ne pas prétendre arriver à la cheville du plus mauvais Neil Young, d'un autre côté suffisamment ennuyeux et prétentieux pour n'éveiller en vous la moindre sympathie. Là se pose Definitely Maybe. C'est ...posé, prétentieux, banal et convenu au possible. Aussi passionnant qu'écouter les cours de la bourse et plus prévisible que l'addition au supermarché. La voix du chanteur donnerait de l'urticaire à n'importe quel homme un tant soi peu mélomane. Seules 3 choses sont à sauver :  la ballade sucrée Live Forever, le tube radio Supersonic qu'il faut avoir écouté sous peine de passer pour un ermite au fond de sa caverne et surtout, surtout, une production en béton. La production est énorme. Du coup ce groupe a cru sans doute l'être aussi. Grossière erreur. Bref, une oeuvre horripilante dont on ferait bien de m'expliquer l'intérêt car il m'est complètement passé au dessus de la tête."
1,"cet album n'a eu comme seul mérite que de liquider la vague hair-metal qui était à son apogée en 1991, pour le reste c'est très moyen, Cobain était certainement un type interessant mais musicalement ca reste limité, avant nirvana y'avait un autre groupe us bien plus novateur, c'était husker du, les pionniers du punk-pop! un zéro pointé à l'entourage de cobain qui a tué la poule aux oeufs d'or, incapable de mettre à l'abri cobain de ses propres démons, on presse le citron et puis quand il n'y a plus de jus, y'en a plus, au suivant m'sieur'dame!"
5,"Low profile, c'est ce que signifie le visuel de la pochette. Par ce jeu de mots, Bowie veut marquer son retour à l'expérimentation et à la modestie après des années sexe, rock and coco. Le nez dans la poudre, il avait déjà annoncé son retour en Europe par cette phrase tirée de Station to Station : ""The European cannon is here"", soit le modèle européen est à portée de main. Enregistré en France au Château d'Hérouville, Low n'en demeure pas moins une pièce fondamentale du tryptique berlinois. Peu défendu par RCA en 1977 parce que jugé non commercial, Low apparaît 23 ans plus tard comme une oeuvre majeure ayant influencée toute la cold wave et l'electro-pop des années 80. Déroutant, toujours surprenant avec ses deux faces bien différenciées, l'album s'ouvrira à ceux qui sans cesse l'écouteront. Mes deux morceaux préférés : Warzsavia et Subterraneans qui évoquent des paysages désolés comme peu de chansons auront jamais pu les ""peindre""."
5,"Certains prennent cet enregistrement pour un best of. C'est en effet une sommité quel ange? Quelle égérie? est venu carresser une plume aussi alerte.Poésie de la note,du verbe,orchestrations magistrales.Seul petit grain de sable: les solos électiques de notre compositeur qui malgrés leurs imperfections nous rappellent quelque peu :""Buffalo Springfield"""
5,"A tout prendre, autant ce Let It bi là que le Naked de Paulo. Pourtant, je me souviens de ma déception lors de l'achat de Let it Be, (faut dire que derrière le champagnissime Abbey road ça faisait tout bizarre) d'autant qu'il coutait bonbon dans son emballage de luxe cartonné, son livret avec plein de photos des séances d'enregistrement. Les arrangements sont ce qu'ils sont, et malgré les ""tambours et trompettes"" de Phil Spector, qui soit disant alourdissent l'ensemble, je le préfère ainsi que dans la nudité du Naked (ta mère). De plus on entend des bribes de conversations, des morceaux certes inachevés, mais le tout donne du ludique à un CD dont l'enregistrement ne fût pas toujours des plus joyeux. Alors ""parlez moi du Naked et je vous vous mon poing sur la gueule, sauf le respect que je vous dois"". Avec le recul, ce CD est encore une fois sublime (je sais, je ne suis pas objectif, pourtant je pèse mes maux... mouais) car les mélodies, comme d'habitude sont d'une force irrésistible (là je suis sérieux). Pour les partisans du ""Naked"" , à ce compte là autant aller jusqu'au bout du dénuement et enlever tous les instruments pour ne laisser que les voix. Ainsi, chacun pourra refaire ce disque à son goût et on en aura fini de Paul et Mickey sur Let it Be. Allez, zou, 5 étoiles à let it be qui le mérite bien. Par contre, je n'ai encore jamais écouté un remasterisé... parait que c'est chouette."
5,"Rubber soul est un album fantastique, qui comme la si bien un internaute ci dessus, a fait passé les beatles de ""l'excellent"" au ""mythique"", grace a des perles pop, des nouveautés. Les chansons sont toujours aussi efficaces, mais plus fines par rapport a tout ce qu'ils avaient fait auparavant, le joyau de l'album, pour moi, reste ""in my life"" avec ses textes nostalgiques et sa superbe mélodie, le tout signé john lennon."
2,"Sans doute l'album le moins intéressant de la carrière de Supertramp, à réserver aux fans du groupe qui souhaitent découvrir ses origines. Pour les autres, sachez que cela n'a rien à voir avec le reste de leur carrière. Je trouve que leur premier album est bien plus riche et plus homogène. Celui-ci est plus pop mais on est encore très loin de la qualité de composition et d'enregistrement de ""Crime of the century"" ! Si vous recherchez le ""son Supertramp"" des 70s, essayez autre chose, ""Indelibly stamped"" reste un album pour les fans."
5,"Cet album est superbe autant que méconnu. Il est à part dans la discographie du groupe. Il n'a pas le ""son"" du groupe, pas plus que le suivant d'ailleurs. Il n'a de commun avec les bons albums à suivre que la richesse des mélodies et les trouvailles d'arrangements apportées par Davies.  Supertramp n'est pas encore au complet, mais Aubade, Words Unspoken et Maybe I'm a Beggar sont des petites merveilles qui justifient les 5 étoiles par leur phrasé et leur mélodie. Ces titres sont uniques dans l'histoire du groupe."
4,"Après l'accueil triomphal de ""Exit Planet Dust"", les deux mancuniens remettent ça. On reste dans le Break-Beat, peut-être plus ennervé que sur le premier album. Oui mais ça marche encore. Et on reinvite des copains, Noël Gallagher sur ""Sitting Sun"", et Beth Orton déjà présente sur le précédent opus. C'est sûr que c'est moins orienté Dance-Floor et que c'est très proche du répétitif absolu, mais ça touche quand même pas mal l'auditeur. Et puis il ya ce ""Private Psychedelic Reel"", avec sa boucle allucinante, le meilleur morceau de l'album pour moi. Franchement pas indispensable mais possédez-le c'est avant tout un disque fédérateur."
5,"Cela fait maintenant plusieurs années que Portishead m'a ouvert un nouveau champ d'horizons, une nouvelle conception des choses et de leur valeur. Laissez-vous envouter par la musique de geoff Barlow qui vous aides à comprendre le message chanté par ""the Voice"" de la trip hop Beth Gibbons. dummy n'a pas 1 ton depressif comme on peut l'entendre parfois mais bien réaliste!                 une autre réalité..."
5,"Portishead revient avec un deuxième album, trois ans après Dummy, mais avec un style bien qu'un peu plus colèrique, toujours aussi bouleversant."
5,"Les SKA-P nous prouvent encore sur cet album qu'ils sont vraiment les maitres incontestés du genre. Fidèlent à leur coktail explosif mélangeant punk-rock, ska en passant par le raggae, ils crachent sur les problèmes de la société, comme ils savent si bien le faire. Bref, les SKA-P ont toujours autant d'énergie. Tout est dit, voilà donc un cd qui devrait en faire jumper plus d'un!!!!"
5,"Cet album reste en majorité l'œuvre de Brian May et Freddie Mercury, en effet ils se sont partagé l'album en deux jouant sur le côté Blanc (May) et le côté Noir (Mercury). Sur la face A, face blanche sur le vinyle original, Mr May nous fait une entrée de guitare grandiloquente avec « Procession », instrumental qui leur servira à ouvrir leurs concerts jusqu'en 1976. Celui ci s'enchaîne avec « Father to Son » hymne lyrique Hard Rock, style que Brian affectionne tous particulièrement, puis s'envient une des pièces maîtresses de l'album : « White Queen ». Douce ballade Mayenne extraordinaire comportant un passage instrumental de toute beauté. Brian avouera plus tard que « White Queen » reste la chanson dont il est le plus fier. « Some Day One Day » ne restera pas dans les annales et ne sera jamais joué en live, cependant ce titre très Folk n'en reste pas moins un témoignage du guitariste qui s'amuse à superposer les bandes jusqu'à enregistrer de façon subtile 5 guitares à la fois. C'est d'ailleurs lui même qui chante sur ce titre. En effet il a noté que dans la discographie de Queen et ce jusqu'au début des 80's, sur chaque album un titre était chanté par Brian et un par Roger Taylor. Ce lui là même qui composa « The Loser In The End » qui vient conclure la première face du LP. Il faut dire que la voie de Taylor, rocailleuse à souhait se prête très bien à cet exercice de style très Rock'n'Roll. Mais là où Queen s'envole c'est sur la face noire totalement acquise à Mercury qui nous assaille d'emblée avec « Ogre Battle ». Riffs de guitares qui taillent le roc, chants grandiloquents, une fable Mercuryenne dans toute sa splendeur. On n'a pas le temps de se reposer que les premières mesures de « The Fairy Feller's Master Stroke » déferlent des HP. Musique alambiquée à souhait, montés et descentes de gammes réalisées avec tellement de subtilités... qu'on a du mal à se rendre compte de la difficulté de l'exercice. « Nevermore » arrive juste à point pour que l'on puisse reprendre son souffle... mais pas trop longtemps puisque « The March Of The Black Queen », morceau épique et purement progressif nous rentre dedans avec ses flots de guitares, des voix qui arrivent de toute part, une orchestration magique qui en fait le morceau pilier de l'album. Freddie à envie de calmer le jeu et nous propose « Funny How Love Is » gentille chansonnette au refrain pénétrant. Vient le final... et quel final ! « Seven Seas Of Rhye » casse la baraque, premier succès commercial du groupe, il emporte Queen vers les sommets de la gloire d'où ils ne redescendront jamais."
2,"on pensait pas qu'il sortirai un jour ! il aura fallu attendre 6 ans entre le dernier album, et je dois dire que je suis tres decu ... grand fan de Fiona, j'ai adoré ses deux premier album, en particulier When The Pawn, et je pensais que ce troisieme album allait etre celui de la consecration.. il n'en est malheureusement rien. Seul le titre Please Please Please a retenu mon attention, les autre, apres pourtant de multiple ecoute, ne m'ont toujours pas accroché l'oreille comme ce fut le cas pour ses deux precedants opus . Vraiment a reserver aux fans de Fiona, et encore ..."
5,"Un mélomane éclairé a cité le 17° siècle (voir commentaire suivant) pour Ian Anderson et ses amis. J'avais moi-même le sentiment d'avoir à faire à un personnage directement issu de l'univers de William Shakespear, tant par la qualité musicale que par le tempérament du créateur, j'ai cité Sir Ian Anderson. Benefit est un des opus du groupe, très réprésentatifs de toute cette culture, so british, so scotish, so beautiful. A ne pas manquer et à mettre dans la collection avec This was, Stand up, Aqualung, Thick as a Brick et bien sûr le tant décrié A passion play...A vous de jouer, ou plutôt de faire jouer ces messieurs du JT (non pas le journal télévisé, mais Jethro Tull : DJisro toal-intraduisible en phonétique à la française).."
5,"La voix d'Anderson, les orfévreries délicates et acoustiques, l'inspiration mélodique folk plus que médiévale ici, le tissage subtil des arrangements où les cordes donnent une profondeur réelle à l'univers musical du groupe font de cet album l'un des plus séduisants du Tull. Mais plus encore, l'énergie et le feeling exceptionel de Martin Barre sur les titres les plus agressifs sont sidérants : deux bombes ouvrent l'album dans lesquells Barre laisse éclater toute l'originalaité de son jeu, signatures rythmiques complexes, harmonies venues du folk et du blues, idiome hard rock que personne à l'époque ne semble vouloir pratiquer dans les même eaux que le guitariste du Tull. Derrière lui, lma section rythmique fait des merveilles et démontre une forme de virtuosité bien plus proche dans l'esprit d'un Gentle Giant que d'un Yes. Le remarstered donne une profondeur sonore qui compense la perte de ""chaleur"" du vynil, mais surtout les bonus, excellents, rendent l'achat de cette rééedition nécessaire aux fans, et permettra aux néophytes de découvrir l'un des plus beaux albums du Tull."
5,"Excellent groupe, excellent disque, superbe présentation Digipack avec de nombreuses photos retraçant l'histoire d'un groupe méconnu, qui nous replonge dans l'ambiance ""British Beat"" des sixties !  Pour tous les amoureux de Garage Rock, en particulier ceux qui apprécient les Pretty Things, Downliners Sect, Billy Childish, Milkshakes, Headcoats ainsi que le Garage Rock et le film ""Ne nous fâchons pas"" !"
5,"Je ferais mieux de consacrer mon temps aux albums des Kinks que je n'aime pas, ça irait beaucoup plus vite !  Celui-là est dans le haut du panier et contient le ""where have all the good times gone"" popularisé par la reprise de Bowie. Les autres titres sont sans doute moins connus mais leur qualité est indéniable et confirme les Kinks groupe anglais majeur et incontournable."
5,"Il est assez difficile de trouver l'intérêt et le génie d'Arthur Lee à la première écoute, mais penchez vous un peu sur le cas, et vous comprendrez que ca vaut le coup. Cet album est sans doute l'un des plus importants de tous les temps (il est à signaler que c'est grâce à Arthur Lee que les Doors ont trouvé un éditeur) puisque rares sont les groupes à avoir inspirer les Beatles, les Stones, les Doors (et j'en passe, parce que la liste serait longue). Mais quel intérêt ceci mis à part? Tout simplement le fait que le chanteur/compositeur est à fleur de peau, il est grandiose, son génie transpire à chaque note, et il sait passer des moments d'énervements aux moments calmes comme aucun jusqu'ici. A priroi je dirais que cet album est à mettre dans le lot des meilleurs albums de tous les temps en concurrence avec le White Album des Beatles et OKComputer de Radiohead. Bonne écoute à vous, bientôt vous ne pourrez plus vous en séparer."
4,"De plus en plus, nos musiques s'arrêtent à tous ces albums commercials(radio, télé...) et c'est bien dommage.    Mais heureusement certains groupes ressortent de l'ordinaire tel DEBOUT SUR LE ZINC...Ici, la chanson française renait par l'humour, et des paroles que l'on retient facilement... Le rire,l'amusement, le délire se dégage de ces albums mais tout ceci avec un grand talent ressortant de la maitrise de différents instruments tels guitare, batterie, mandole, xylophone, contrebasse, violon, trompette, clarinette et bien d'autres encore! Des voix, une incroyable variété d'instruments enfin un groupe à découvrir..."
2,"L'écoute de l'extrait de la chanson ""help"" que vous proposez fait référence à la version courante de cette chanson. Pouvez-vous cependant m'assurer que la version contenu sur le CD est bien l'originale, c'est-à-dire la version COMPLETE avec l'introuction musicale ? Vous en remerciant par avance"
5,"This movie is currently the rage in the USA, where I live, I've seen it 4 times already.  It's possibly the best movie I've ever seen.  I and everyone I know who has seen it is simply outraged that it is not up for best picture by the oscars, c'est dommage, Bravo France!!"
2,On y trouve la musique du DVD. Mais la qualité sonnore n' est pas aussi bonne que celle du DVD. Le rendu audio de ce CD est médiocre.
1,La musique est certes correcte mais il s'agit ni plus ni moins d'un pompage honteux de Rachmaninov (notamment sa première symphonie).
5,"Cet album est magnifique. Après plusieurs écoutes, je suis enchanté de l'écouter et d'apprécier les mélodies qui s'y trouvent. Beaucoup de changements dans les musiques je trouve et aussi dans les paroles car je trouve que Mylène est plus directe dans la manière de parler de l'amour qui est très présent dans cet album. Je suis heureux d'avoir attendu pour entendre ses nouvelles chansons. Vivement le concert et longue vie !!"
5,"Les Blankass ex-Zéro de Conduite ont commencé trés jeunes comme il se doit,pour forger leur pop-rock bien balancé.Il joué avec leurs modèles, Clash, U2 ou Gun Club dans les 80's et ça s'entends sur ce Live chaleureux ou le groupe déroule  son rock sincère, franco de port, tendre et sauvage, de trés bonne facture, parsemé de quelques hits honorables.Le second disque est un DVD, il ajoute au plaisir de retrouver sur scène et en clip ce groupe talentueux et sympathique qui dégage bonne humeur et energie."
5,"Il est difficile de dire ce qu'il y a de meilleur quand tout est aussi fumant. Quel titre, quel album ?  En tout cas, il est amusant de se dire que le hasard s'est vraiment mêlé de l'affaire pour que deux des plus grands compositeurs/songwritrs de tous les temps se soient rencontrés, liés d'amitié et associés. A croire à la predestination ! Quant à George, qui a aussi des chansons aussi réussies que Taxman et surtout ""I want to tell you"" hymne à la paralysie amoureuse que tout individu ayant été foudroyé a connu, il était tout à fait excellent et ne déparait pas. Là encore, l'aléatoire Fatum..."
4,"Ceux qui ne regardent pas plus loin que ""Dirrty"", un titre festif comme seul les américains savent le faire, et son clip sulfureux (Réalisé volontairement pour casser son image de chanteuse pop gentillette) se voilent la face. Christina aurait pu faire comme Britney Spears, sa ""rivale"" des débuts : de la pop efficace -toujours très guimauve- et quelques titres r&amp;b pour se mettre à la page. Eh, bien, pas du tout!. Sur ""Stripped"", Christina Aguilera prend les choses en main. Elle co-signe la quasi-totalité de ses chansons et collabore notamment avec la talentueuse Alicia Keys, sa copine rappeuse Lil' Kim, le rappeur Redman, les producteurs Rockwilder (Mary J. Blige, Tweet, Janet Jackson), Scott Storch (Snoop Dog, Busta Rhymes, Nas, Pink, The Roots), Glenn Ballard (Alanis Morissette, No Doubt, The Corrs) et Linda Perry, l'ex-chanteuse du groupe 4 Non Blondes, qui avait réalisé du bon boulot sur le dernier album de Pink. Résultat: on obtient un album très éclectique où Christina dévoile ses nombreuses préférences musicales sans verser dans l'à-peu-près ou dans ""le vite-fait, bien-fait"". Ca sonne r&amp;b, hip-hop, soul, pop, rock, bref, c'est tout le contraire d'un album sans saveur. Et si elle se déshabille, ce n'est pas seulement au sens propre mais surtout au sens figuré. Christina met sa voix en valeur sur des textes de qualité et prouve qu'elle a le potentiel pour faire une très grande carrière. Mention spéciale aux titres ""can't hold us down"", ""impossible"", ""beautiful"", ""cruz"", ""dirrty"" et ""I'm ok"" (une chanson très personnelle où elle évoque la violence de son père)."
5,"L'album incontournable du rock des années 70. Toute la musique de Pink Floyd pourrait être résumée dans cet album de 5 chansons.Magique, envoutant, mythique : Un voyage au coeur d'une autre musique, l'inimitable style de Pink Floyd. Un collector"
1,"Pourquoi faut-il que les disques de chanson française aient un aussi mauvais son ? Trop de compression de dynamique, son metallique et sans relief, voix sifflante et nasillarde, orchestration trop en retrait."
1,"personnellement je n'aime pas du tout ni la voix, ni les paroles, ni la musique !!!"
5,"Thirlwell est sans aucun doute LA référence en matière de rock industriel. Nin inch nails, Manson et compagnie lui doivent tout. Sur cet album dingue et avant-gardiste, on peut entendre entre autres le génial ""I'll meet you in Poland Baby"", la plus grande et hallucinante évocation de l'obscure période nazie jamais composée en rock. Sinon on pourra toujours se tourner vers le dernier et excellent album de foetus (""Love"")."
2,"J'ai beau faire, j'ai beau insister, je n'y arrive pas, je n'aime pas! On sent trop d'influence de son compagnon, et je trouve le tout relativement indigeste, les mots parfois mal choisis, à la limite du ""ridicule"". j'ai du mal à qualifier ce que j'ai ressenti à l'écoute de cet album tant attendu pour ma part. Juste une grande déception, un manque d'intérêt quasi total de ma part, malgré plusieurs écoutes ""forcées"". Dommage..."
1,"Comment se fait-il qu'il y est l'Anglais, l'Allemand et le Suédois, mais pas le FRANCAIS ????? Est-ce un oubli?.... Chris."
4,J'ai découvert amandine lors de la nouvelle star et sa voix m'a séduite immédiatement. Son album confirme ce talent et nous fait découvrir sa plume très jolie aussi. Personnellement j'aurais aimé l'entendre dans un registre + funk + groove mais son album est très beau et je le passe en boucle à la maison.
1,"Ma gentille maman m'a toujours dit qu'on ne tire pas sur les ambulances, et quand je vois les 2 commentaires qui m'ont précédés, je me rappelle de ces bonnes paroles...pourtant c'est pas facile, car voilà bien longtemps que l'on n'avait pas entendu ce niveau de médiocrité en provenance du Canada. Oui la voix est archi trafiquée sur tous les titres, vivement le concert qu'on rigole en sifflotant des bières. Oui la musique est au niveau zéro de ce que l'on peut faire avec un piano. Oui les textes sont consternants alors si c'est vraiment celà que les pirates ont dans le coeur, la lutte hadopisée contre le piratage n'a pas de soucis à faire. Un coeur de pirate sans couill*s !"
2,"j'avais adoré ""inventaire"", mais je n'aime pas trop ""caféine"" En bref 50% de l'album est très bon, 50% est pas très bon, voir à ch***. Mais bon restons correcte, après tout il s'agit du fruit d'un travail. Plusieurs chansons sont très entrainantes, d'autres douce, mais agréable à entendre, et d'autres encores qui arrivent tout droit de la planète Mars et qui sont vraiment pas agréables! La plume de Zazie manque beaucoup. Voilà, si vous tenez à l'acheté prenez la version simple, sinon sa ne vaut pas trop le coup, mais ce n'est qu'un avis personnel."
5,"Franchement j'ai entendu cet album pour la premiere fois cet été, et j'ai énormément aimé. Je suis soulagée de savoir que la France ne passera pas a coté d'un tel groupe, du moins ils sont bien partis pour cartoner chez nous! Et ce n'est que justice pour ce groupe finlandais qui est super connu en europe du nord, et commence a venir vers nous! Les chansons sont bien écrites, et la musique tout aussi magnifique! Un MUST pour toute personne qui aime la bonne musique!"
1,"J'ai été très déçu par ce nouvel album, bien loin des espoirs placés dans ""l'hotel de l'univers"". L'album se veut calme et posé, mais l'écouter sans s'énerver est un vrai exploit, tant il est lent et ennuyeux. Ou sont passés les rythmes rocks? Ou sont passés les textes révoltés? Raphael a t-il oublié qui il était pour se courber aux loies du marketting?"
2,"C'est pas qu'elle n'est pas sympatique la petite Julie Mais... L'album et assez easy dans le sens édulcoré. Je n'ai aucun doute il va marcher sa voix est d'ailleurs trés efficace; Notamment sur le titre phare ""si je m'en sors"". Mais voila le problème est que la petite Julie est passer par l'école Lara Fabian ses melodies m'y font cruellement penser. Alors Julie s'il te plait arrettes passes a un autre style et quittes Patrick Fiori...  MON DIEU LE CAUCHEMAR CONTINUE  aller va Julie Je t'aiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiimeuuuuuh quand même..."
2,"La crise vous mine? Il pleut? Vous toussez et craignez d'avoir attrapé la grippe porcine?J'ai ce qu'il faut pour vous redonner le sourire: allez sur le site de Pep's..vous y lirez que ses influences sont Noir Desir,Ben Harper, et , je garde le meilleur pour la fin,  ..Mais,reprenons notre serieux ..Euh , Pep's tu entends par influence que tu en as entendu un jour par hasard un morceau  chez ton oncle ? Non , parce que à l'ecoute de ce que tu fais ,excuses moi, mais ces références ne sautent pas aux yeux. Et Gregoire, son influence ce sont   peut-etre? Non, on est dans la pop variet  ,  et à des lieux en dessous d'un  ou de ,quant au coté revolté que j'ai pu lire ici où là, je le cherche encore, ou alors revolté à la Zazie/Benabar/Calogero... De Pep's , ca en manque cruellement tout ca  (facile celle là), c'est au contraire d'un mou et d'un plat.. Parfait pour la fete du camping de la plage a coté de chez moi (voir mon com sur   ) mais pas de quoi s'emballer non plus. Dire qu'il était nominé aux victoires de la musique ; pfff quelle époque.."
1,"Booba...je pense sincérement qu'il devrais en rester là. Ses textes ne sont qu'une multitude de grossièreté, un fond musical plat, globalement cet album, comme tous les autres, n'a aucun intérêt, et n'apporte rien. Ennuyant, inécoutable, plat, grossier...Au final, ne gaspillez pas votre argent pour cette nulité...et si vous l'avez acheté, tout droit à la poubelle, c'est sa place."
1,"C'est vraiment ""culcul la praline"" avec des paroles niaises qui alternent parfois avec de vraies tentatives poétiques qu'on a bien du mal à comprendre quand coeur de pirate articule avec sa voix maniérée...  ""Il m'aime encore, et toi tu m'aime un peu plus fort  Mais il m'aime encore, et moi je t'aime un peu plus fort  Et malgré ça il m'aime encore, et moi je t'aime un peu plus fort  Mais il m'aime encore, et moi je t'aime un peu plus fort""  Je vois que la niaiserie des paroles touche tous les francophones. Au moins ce n'est pas difficile à retenir !  Quant au piano, c'est ""Mozart pour les Nuls"" avec des arpèges qui nous feraient engueuler notre voisin en l'encourageant de répéter avec un casque.  Pirate de coeur l'es-tu ? Non. Seulement dans le nom... Un disque pour ado qui n'a jamais rien écouté et qui veut pleurer parce que son camarade de classe ne daigne pas lui donner de l'attention... ou souffre de trouble de l'audition...  Si Coeur de pirate a un coeur de pirate, je crois que si elle est audiophile, elle n'aurait sûrement pas envie de se pirater elle-même ; alors quant à l'acheter : encore moins !!!  Si y'avait zéro étoile ça aurait été zéro !"
1,"Que certaines personnes trouvent cela bien, je suis affligé.. Bien sûr les goûts et les couleurs ne se discutent pas... Mais comme disait Coluche ""Je ne suis pas musicien mais j'entends aussi bien que les mecs qui achètent les disque"" Ici j'ai bien écouté et c'est vraiment inquiétant pour l'avenir car c'est de la Daube bien markettée.  Heureusement cette semaine les ventes du  King de la Pop remettent les pendules à l'heure !"
5,"Ceux qui ont aimé les prestations d'Amel dans ""Nouvelle star"" aimeront son album, c'est sûr ! Elle touche à différents styles de chansons, à chaque fois avec bonheur. Elle est entièrement digne de la chance qui lui est donnée, sa générosité est omniprésente sur l'album, et que dire de sa voix ! Je lui souhaite une très longue carrière, à la hauteur de son talent."
5,"Ce coffret a obtenu jadis un Diapason d'Or. En effet Maurizio Pollini a fait merveille : souverain dans l'opus 101, abrupt dans l'opus 106, extraordinairement fidèle à la lettre dans les opus 109 et 110, et hypnotique dans l'opus 111. Comment résister à l'envie d'écouter ces versions insurpassables ?"
1,"Les neufs symphonies de Ludwig van Beethoven par le Wiener Philharmoniker et Simon Rattle. Honnêtement je pense que si Monsieur Beethoven serait encore parmi nous il grincerait des dents en écoutant ses belles symphonies interprétées par Simon Rattle qui en mettant sa touche personnelle ( comme toutes autres dirigeants ) égratigne et déforme correctement certains passages des neufs symphonies.Je possède les symphonies de Beethoven interprétées par les plus grands dirigeants Kleiber,Blomstedt,Karajan,Abbado et Kubelik mais la très dure pour les oreilles.Je regrette rarement un achat mais celui la il est an haut de la liste.Musicalement vôtre"
5,"Cet enregistrement suscite la curiosité : Bruno Cocset a enregistré les six suites avec six violoncelles différents, copies modernes d'anciens instruments de différents luthiers, tous italiens, et de différentes époques allant de 1600 à 1734. La sixième suite est interprétée sur un instrument à cinq cordes pour lequel elle a été écrite, et cela lui va très bien.  Changer de suite c'est donc aussi changer d'équilibre entre basse, médium et aigu, découvrir un grain, un équilibre entre harmoniques et des résonances différentes, puis, assez rapidement, se laisser apprivoiser par ce nouveau son et être emporté par la musique. Et là, un deuxième niveau de bonheur se révèle à nos oreilles, Bruno Cocset donne beaucoup de vie et de personnalité à chacune des suites, sait magnifiquement manier les contrastes entre les différents mouvements, les articulations sont nettes, les danses 'dansent' avec une certaine rondeur, sans heurt mais avec vigueur quand il le faut.  A la diversité des intruments et au jeu de Bruno Cocset s'ajoute l'acoustique de la chapelle de l'hôpital ND du bon secours magnifiquement rendue par l'enregistrement et utilisée par l'instrumentiste qui, à l'image d'un organiste, sait doser les respirations pour rebondir sur la mémoire des notes suspendues très haut dans les voûtes. La précision de l'enregistrement fait aussi entendre le frappement des doigts sur la touche, ce qui ajoute un petit rythme de pas dansés bien en phase avec la musique. Par contre, le souffle de l'instrumentiste est quelquefois un peu trop présent, petit défaut sans doute nécessaire pour que tout le reste soit audible. Les suites pour violoncelle seul de Bach suscitent (il suffit de regarder le catalogue) et méritent une diversité d'interprétations, j'ai dans ma discothèque les enregistrements de Casals, Fournier, Tortelier, Gastinel et Cocset, et c'est actuellement celle de Cocset qui revient le plus souvent sur ma platine. Sans doute la proximité, la diversité et la richesse des sons y sont pour beaucoup, mais l'interprétation est tout à fait remarquable et le plaisir perdurera au delà de la découverte."
2,"Du Rameau encore inédit, c'est toujours une fête. Si Reyne tire le maximum de son orchestre (danses réussies bien qu'un peu raides), il s'avère un bien piètre chef de chœur. C'est à se demander si le rédacteur de Diapason a écouté ce disque au-delà de l'ouverture ! Les interventions chorales sont autant d'épreuves (manque d'unité dans les pupitres + départs à contretemps + gros problèmes de diction + sopranos criardes). La prise de son, trop proche et sans finesse, n'arrange rien."
2,"Un opéra n'est pas seulement une suite de morceaux avec de bonnes voix. C'est aussi du théatre, un ambiance à installer... Et là, cette version rate complètement sa cible."
1,"CELA AURAIT ETE UN TRES BEL ENREGISTREMENT SI MR VRENIOS, QUI CHANTE RAOUL AVAIT EU DE LA VOIX !! QUAND ON PENSE QU'ALAIN VANZO ENREGISTRAIT A CETTE EPOQUE POUR LA MÊME MAISON DE DISQUES (LAKME) UNE BELLE OCCASION RATEE !!"
5,"On le savait déjà avec sa piquante interprétation de la Fiorilla d'Il Turco in Italia (écouter l'enregistrement de 1954 à La Scala), et on en a la confirmation éclatante ici : tragédienne sublime, elle pouvait être aussi une merveilleuse comédienne. Entourée d'une superbe distribution (Gobbi, Alva), elle campe une Rosina impertinente et mutine avec infiniment de charme et la voix qu'on lui connait. Cette version est pour moi incomparablement supérieure à celle de la Scala avec Giulini où elle était passée à côté du rôle, au point que l'on prétend que Giulini avait été extrêmement déçu. Bonne qualité sonore après remasterisation, malgré un petit manque de relief."
5,"Un absolu ravissement... Si l'on ne devait avoir qu'un seul album de Tracy Chapman, il faudrait que ce soit celui ci. Ce premier album est un chef d'oeuvre, nouveauté à l'époque, un parfait fondu entre la country music et le chant noir militant : on y trouve même une chanson chantée acapella, des arrangements superbes, un son soyeux à souhait, une voix déchirante de sensibilité. Une pure merveille ; the one ; the only. Cela rendrait presque le reste de l'oeuvre anecdotique..."
5,c'est un disque fabuleux que je cherchais depuis longtemps est que j'ai trouver en import  incontournable pour les fan's du genre
1,"First of all I would like to make clear from the begining that the point of my review is not to criticize Rolando Villazon's talent and voice as a performer and musical instrument.Because human voice is a musical instrument.But... Is anybody out there who realy believes that all we need is one more cd with Handel opera arias especialy from the super star tenor Rolando Villazon?What about so many singers talented Baroque Opera performers like Gilles Ragon,Carlo Vincenzo Allemano,Laurent Naouri,Paul Agnew,Jerome Correas,Janet Williams,Ewa Malas Godlewska,Isabelle Poulenard,Anne-Lise Sollied,Iris Vermillion and many others who have spent their lifes performing Baroque vocal music and never been given the opportunity to record their personal cds with Baroque arias.Yes,of course they don't belong to a big recording label like Decca,Deutsche Gramophone or Virgin Classics where the rest composers from the Baroque period are not as prominent as Handel.Fortunately some of them like Mark Padmore,Sandrine Piau,Veronica Cangemi(an amazing soprano who recently recorded her debut portrait cd)and the late Lorraine Hunt Liberson made excellent recordings that clear up what Baroque vocal music is stood for.Recently Rolando Villazon began to perform and record Baroque music with Emmanuelle Haim but I am not quite sure if this was Haim's choice or Virgin's claim.The fact is that the lyric tenor of the Romantic type was unknown to Baroque opera.The baritone-tenor and the bass were only used in roles such as the rival of the lover(who usaly was a castrato or a female singer in travesti,in character parts,and at some periods in buffo parts.If you are a Villazon's fun you probably be delighted but if you are a Baroque vocal music lover who likes historically based performances I do not recomend this cd.If you want to find out the truth about the Baroque vocal music(the real Bel Canto),Rodolfo Celletti's book 'A history of Bel Canto' is available in amazon."
1,"Nous connaissions déjà le Villazon qui nous écorchait le Combattimento de Monteverdi et on aurait pensé que ce serait sa seule escapade baroque. Et bien non ! Pauvre Handel ! Car Villazon récidive avec Handel en massacrant nombre d'airs de Handel, en particulier l'air d'Ariodante ""Schera infida"". La manière de chanter du ténor est un véritable désastre, celui-ci écorche les mots, les notes... mais surtout nos oreilles ! On trouve nombre de transcriptions d'air pour contre-ténor alors qu'il existe de nombreux aires pour ténor (cf. Messiah). A côté de la voix écrasante de Villazon, les Gabrieli Players et Paul McCreesh qui se trainent dans la boue pour la première fois depuis la fondation de l'ensemble avec des cordes plates et un clavecin des plus mous. Mais la cerise sur le gâteau, c'est que Villazon force sur sa voix comme ce n'est pas permis. En bref, un album minable, avec des interprètes tout aussi minables. Ce serait donc jeter l'argent par la fenêtre que d'acheter ce CD. Passons donc notre chemin et dirigeons-nous vers de vrais chanteurs comme Magdalena Kozena ou Ian Bostridge."
2,"DIRTY DANCING 2  et un joli petit film , mais il n'arrive pas à la cheville de DIRTY DANCING le premier , dans le n°2, ils ont ajouté , la politique et la haine raciale ce qui a tué ,le rêve , la romance , l'amour et l'émotion que procure la magie de la dance qu'il y a dans le n°1"
2,"Carlo Maria Giulini s'attache à détailler toutes les finesses de la partition sans parvenir à donner vie à ces ""Tableaux"". Dénervés par un geste austère, ""Gnomus"", ""la place du marché de Limoges"" ou ""Baba Yaga"" perdent leur impact, ce qui est aussi imputable à la pâte sonore bien malingre d'une Philharmonie de Berlin qu'on a connue plus en chair. La subtilité de l'interprétation que le chef italien réalisa à Chicago en 1977 pour DG s'est ici radicalisée en une lecture exsangue. Les volets qui appellent d'ordinaire la grandiloquence (""Bydlo"", ""catacombes"", ""grande porte de Kiev"") acquièrent en tout cas une salutaire sobriété. Bien maigre consolation... Et ce n'est guère un ""Oiseau de feu"" fossilisé qui fera meilleure impression."
5,"Les affres de la composition mahlérienne trouvent en Guiseppe Sinopoli un de leurs plus remarquables interprètes. Le chef italien peut appliquer tout à son aise sa pratique de la psychanalyse à la personnalité complexe de Mahler. A la tête d'un Philharmonia Orchestra somptueux et servi par une équipe de solistes imbattable, Sinopoli nous livre une intégrale-testament tout aussi émouvante qu'impressionnante."
4,"Si le métal vous fatigue par ses clichés et son manque d'inventivité, si les esthètes raccornis de Jazz ""moderne"" type Wynton Marsalis vous font bailler, Painkiller est la solution. Mick Harris (ex Napalm Death) à la batterie, Bill Laswell (Matérial, Praxis, producteur/remixeur de Whitney Houston, Miles Davis et Enrico Maccias entre autres) à la basse (très basse) et John Zorn au saxophone alto sauront vous requinquer: Free Jazz métal et dub tellurique sont au programme, le tout improvisé en studio après lecture collective des journaux traitant de la gerre du golf et des attaques de scud sur Israël (le premier disque date de 91). Ecoute déconseillée aux enfants et aux jeunes chiraquiens."
1,"Le titre phare ""DJ"" dissuade à lui seul d'écouter les autres. Ca commence déjà mal, c'est une reprise. Quant aux paroles, difficile d'écouter le morceau jusqu'au bout devant cette accumulation de niaiseries sans intérêt. Des dialogues de tous les jours, des syllabes en trop dans le rythme, un voix totalement banale. Tout se résume à la formule suivante :  musique reprise (aucune créativité) + paroles communes au ras des paquerettes (elle s'est pas foulée) + voix banale = passez votre chemin, ya rien à voir"
5,"Déjà je suis peu objectif car fan de Ronnie James Dio. J'adore sa voix, mais parfois, sur ses albums solos, une trop grande répétition dessert un peu ses talents. Ce n'est pas du tout le cas ici puisque l'album se paie le luxe de porter littéralement la voix de Dio et c'est très grand."
2,"Cet album n'a que deux seuls mérites: a. Dio est un extraordinaire chanteur et il s'en donne à coeur joie dans tout l'album. A croire qu'il a été ""écrit"" pour qu'il nous émerveille de ses vocalises. b. Que 30 ans (!) plus tard, il ne reste plus que Dio. La formule magique Dio/Iommi/Butler qui, sous le nom de Black Sabbath, nous avaient pondu deux disques absolument majestueux (et indispensables à toute cd-thèque qui se respecte), à savoir ""Heaven and Hell"" (oui, cela ne s'invente pas) et ""Mob Rules"", et bien cette magie n'opère plus. Dio a beau essayer de sauver l'ouvrage, il se retrouve bien seul. Certes, parfois, comme un écho d'un flamboyant passé, on se prend à espérer retrouver ce que ce trio avait produit, comme par exemple dans Bible Black. Mais le reste, c'est d'un ennuyeux pas possible: Dio, ok; Musique = c'est toujours la même chose; électrocardiogramme pratiquement plat. Mais où est donc passé la rythmique endiablée de ""Neon Knights"", ""Heaven and Hell"", ""Turn up the night"", ""Voodoo"", ""The Mob rules""? De tout cela il ne reste rien. C'est sans doute ma faute d'avoir voulu croire à une résurrection de ce trio. Dommage."
4,"1984: nos métalleux favoris accouchent de leur second opus et balancent dans nos oreilles une nouvelle vague sonore appelée THRASH (Metallica co-géniteur de cette mouvance avec le ""Hell awaits"" de Slayer). Dés ""fight fire with fire"" on en prend plein les esgourdes et on réalise qu'ils ont grandi,mûri et que ça allait faire très mal à la concurrence! ""for whom the bell tolls"" est solennel à souhait,""fade to black"" est suffisamment mélodique pour nous prendre aux tripes, ""Creeping death"" est le single thrash dont la rythmique joue la sérotonine entre nos neurones et enfin ""call of Ktulu"" conclue majestueusement ce qui reste la référence Thrash:Ride The lightning. Pourquoi 4 étoiles et pas 5? je trouve que les deux autres titres restant de l'album, quoique bons, ne sont pas indispensables"
5,"don't break the oath est l'album point de départ de la légende, bien plus que le déjà très bon mélissa, parceque ce disque est fondateur.   avec don't break the oath, mercyful fate donne une grande leçon de heavy metal et son chanteur king diamond, plante le décors pour les futures générations de black metalleux.    la musique du groupe n'est pas evil en elle-même car mercyful fate évolue musicalement dans un genre heavy d'excellente facture (de nombreux classiques figurent sur cet album)inventif et ingénieux, avec des touches prog' voire légèrement jazzy, bref du heavy intéressant et de haute volée.    là où le groupe frappe encore plus fort qu'avec sa seule et excellente musique, c'est avec le concept satanique développé par son chanteur, king diamond. celui-ci instaure des paroles ésotériques et aime développer des histoires qui foutent la trouille (plus encore sur ses albums solo) et là où on s'attend à une grosse voix des cavernes, nous sommes pris à rebrousse-poil par une voix qui évolue du castrat à la voix claire normale.   c'est particukier, mais sied bien à la musique originale de mercyful fate, il faut juste s'y faire un peu pour rentrer dans le monde musicale extraordinairement riche de ce groupe incontournable."
1,"C'est vraiment du gâchis... Vous êtes privés du titre de clôture, a capella (qui plus est) ! Vraiment, sérieusement, croyez-vous que le Diable adore ce Sabotage-là ?"
5,"Que dire devant tant de merveilles? C 'est tout simplement splendide. Yngwie nous propose avec ce disque certainement l' undes meilleurs albums de guitare. On y retrouve 2 de ses plus grandes compositions ""Far Beyond The Sun"" et "" Black Star "" accompagnées par Icarus Dream suite opus 4 qui est probablement l une de ses meilleurs compo et certainement l une des plus inspirees avec une fin qui n est pas sans rappeler certaines fugues de Bach. Souvent decrié a cause d' une technique qu' il met en valeur à chaque instant tous ces detracteurs devraient ecouter cet album et nottament little savage pour se convaincre qu yngwie melange de facon tres habile la technique et le feeling. La technique est ici mise au profit de la musique contrairement a d autres guitaristes tels que satriani et vai qui sont denues de toute musicalite. enfin et malheureuseùent malgré tant d 'eloges pour cet album les autres ne seront plus du meme acabit et plutot que de refaire un album instrumental dans le meme style on a maintenant droit a des chansons certes assez bonnes mais qui sont loin d atteindre la qualites musicale de celui ci. bref ce cd doit absolument faire parti de votre ludotheque que vous aimiez la guitare ou non."
2,"Mais quelle déception, ce ""Sacred Heart""! OK, Dio est un des plus grands chanteurs de Hard Rock au monde, ""Holy Diver"" et ""The Last in Line"" (ses 2 premiers efforts en solo) sont de véritables classiques du genre, mais ce troisième essai s'avère bien faiblard. J'écris cela parce que j'ai souvent lu qu'après ce disque, Dio entama une longue période de déclin... Je ne peux qu'exprimer mon désaccord, le déclin a déjà bien commencé avec ""Sacred Heart""!  Déjà, la pochette avec son petit dragon tout droit sorti d'un Disney semble vouloir nous mettre en garde: ""Ce que vous allez entendre est loin d'être aussi impressionnant que ce à quoi vous pourriez vous attendre"". Certes, j'admets que ""King of Rock'n'Roll"", ""Sacred Heart"" et ""Rock'n'Roll Children"" sont de bons morceaux. J'ai pris beaucoup de plaisir à les écouter... Et voilà, c'est à peu près tout. Franchement, soyons honnêtes, qui se souvient de chansons comme ""Another Lie"", ""Just Another Day"", ""Fallen Angels"" ou ""Shoot Shoot""? Ont-elles déjà été jouées en concert depuis le milieu des années 80? Ont-elles déjà figuré dans les quelques ""Best Of"" disponibles? Ont-elles été reprises sur un ""Tribute to Dio""?  Question rhétorique, me direz-vous. Evidemment, je connais les réponses (négatives) à ces interrogations. Mais il ne s'agit pas d'une injustice comme celles que je me plais à évoquer régulièrement.  Non, ""Sacred Heart"" est un petit album, pas très convaincant, à la production quelconque, et aux chansons oubliables. Il est plus gentillet, moins épique... pas très inspiré. Rien à voir avec ce que Ronnie James Dio nous a offert au sein de Rainbow, Black Sabbath ou sur ses 2 premiers albums solos.  Il est vrai que ""Dream Evil"", sorti 2 ans plus tard, ne relèvera pas franchement le niveau. Mais le déclin de Dio tant commenté par beaucoup n'aura finalement pas été si long que ça. En effet, ""Lock up the Wolves"" (assez mal aimé) sorti en 1990 se montrera, à mes yeux, bien plus convaincant que ses deux prédecesseurs... sans revenir au niveau des débuts, c'est vrai. Par contre, en 1993, ""Strange Highways"" sera le grand retour de notre nain chantant préféré! Allez, Long Live Dio! Un grand talent, une voix immense, mais quelques albums médiocres aussi... et celui-là en fait incontestablement partie."
5,"Je ne vais pas en rajouter une couche, vous aurez compris en lisant les autres commentaires que cet album est une perle. Très brutal, mais contenant de bonnes mélodies, le son est énorme et l'intensité qui se dégage de l'album est juste incroyable. L'un des meilleurs albums du meilleur groupe de thrash, rien que ça !"
5,"On se souvient de la jeune fille allongée dans l'herbe qui chantait « I'm like a bird ». Depuis ce single célèbre, elle a fourni deux albums dans l'univers pop mais je pense que le marché des chanteuses US pop/rock était trop saturé pour qu'elle puisse y percer (Tori Amos, Alanis Morrisette, puis la déferlante Avril Lavigne, Stacie Orrico,  Hilary Duff...).  Après une pause maternité, elle s'est donc tournée vers le producteur R&amp;B à succès Timbaland et propose au public en 2006 l'album « Loose » et franchement c'est réussi. Vu ses clips, on a du lui demander de véhiculer une image R&amp;B et elle a du y travailler : changement de garde robe et attitude sexy !!!! Et pour notre pur plaisir : ce style lui va si bien. L'album est excellent et regroupe des perles R&amp;B aussi bien slows que dancefloor, un peu de Latino pour un duo avec Juanes.  Elle est arrivée également à prolonger le plaisir de son deuxième album  « Folklore » en insérant quelques ballades pop à sa manière où les instruments se taisent pour laisser place à la voix.  morceau qui veut le détour : ""Say it right"""
1,"Quelle tristesse! Comment supporter ces interminables lamentations!? Voilà un disque d'une platitude inconcevable, c'est le désert des Tartares! Vraiment album parmi les plus glauques...si c'est cela le lyrisme..."
5,"Cet album de James Blunt, live reprend les principaux titres de son cd ""all the lost souls"". ""Same mistake"" est très bien interprétée ainsi que les autres titres. C'est un bon moment passé. Il y a aussi son dernier titre ""love love love"" qui est en version originale. Très belle chanson."
2,"Attention si vous écoutez cet album, c'est mieux avec un volume bas et non moyen ou a fond car ça déchire les tympans. Elle fait que de crier sur toutes les chansons. Seul un titre sort du lot "" irreplaceable"" qui pour moi est le plus réussit."
1,"Je trouve que cet album est très décevant. On se demande souvent si on écoute bien un CD de Madonna, car elle est finalement peu présente sur certains titres, dont 4 minutes. Quant au fond, cela n'a pas la créativité des derniers opus, Ray of Light ou Confession en particulier. Décevant... alors autant investir dans une boite Haribo."
5,"Après avoir sorti son superbe premier album ""Coco""  la belle Californienne Colbie Caillat récidive ici mais nous offre l'album d'origine complété d'un bonus de huit morceaux tous aussi bon les uns que les autres, avec aussi une reprise de Bob Marley et des inédits dont un morceau avec un délicieux accent Français plein de charme... En attendant un DVD LIVE du ""Realize Tour"", si Colbie passe dans votre ville n'hésitez pas... les concerts sont chaleureux et nous ramènent tout droit le soleil et le ""Sound"" de la Californie des années 70 Un très bel album frais, parfait antidote à la crise, idéal pour bien démarrer sa journée sous le ciel Summer-Blue de l'été qui arrive."
5,"J'ai découvert John Legend un peu par hasard! Un ami m'a conseillé de l'acheter et finalement j'ai craqué et je ne regrette absolument pas! Une vraie révélation pour moi, je pense que je ne suis pas prête de pouvoir me séparer de cet album! Que d'émotion, un régal!"
5,"Bon, je ne chronique pas souvent ce genre de groupe, plus ciblé sur l'ado de 14 ans...Trop produit, trop formaté pour les radios, le plus souvent peu original. Pourtant, difficile de résister à cet album. Est ce le timbre de voix du chanteur? les mélodies accrocheuses? le fait qu'il y ait a peu près 12 singles potentiels sur les 13 titres de l'album?! Mystère. cet album s'écoute pourtant en boucle, et certains titres sont promis à un bel avenir ("" coffees for closers"" une tuerie! )et l'ensemble est quand même très très très bien produit et efficace. Seul petit regret, l'ensemble est un peu moins rock que leurs précedents albums, les derniers titres font même pas mal penser au dernier panic at the disco(""WASM"",""20 dollars nose bleed"") .Le bilan reste néanmoins largement positif. Les esprits chagrins me diront qu'on a déjà entendu les mélodies 100 fois, que c'est commercial, pas original.. Et alors? Il faut bien avouer qu'un tel album s'écoute avec un plaisir coupable et qu'il est parfait pour vous mettre la pêche le matin pour aller bosser (quand il fait -3 dehors vous savez?). Si vous souffrez d'une petite depression hivernale, vous savez ce qu'il vous reste à faire ;)"
1,"LP la joue changement. OK. Sauf que d'autres groupes avant eux et dans un segment similaire ont également opéré ce changement. je veux bien qu'un groupe change ou fasse hommage à leurs influences. Mais lorsque c'est du simple plagiat, on approche la consternation, ""leave out all the rest"" emprunte la section rythmique de ""teardrop (Massive Attack)"" sans valeur ajoutée et ""Shadow of the day"" calque celle de ""With or without you"" idem, sans rien apporter. les samples sont poussifs au possible, où sont passé les échantillons sonores abrasifs de hybrid theroy? Le niveau de guitare n'a pas évolué alors que le groupe a enchainé des tournées. Le reste de l'album n'a aucune origanilité LP est devenu un vulgaire groupe de rock (et encore, je risque la diatribe des rockeurs harcore). après des coups marketing comme les versions 1.1 et 1.2 de hybrid (re-animation et collision course) et le transparent Meteora, Lp livre l'album de l'embourgeoisement. Dommage car je persiste à croire que Chester est une voix interessante. le problème c'est que dans le genre un autre groupe qui partage les mêmes initiales se débrouille mieux qu'eux: Lost Prophets."
1,oula.;depuis quelques temps je ne sais pas ce qu'ils nous font car là je dois bien avouer que l'album est médiocre je déconseille vivement d'acheter
1,"Alors c'est ça le nouveau Linkin Park ? Après 4 ans d'attente, ils osent nous sortir cette farce ? Que les choses soient claires : Linkin Park est mort , vive Linkin Park . 3 chansons ""semi gueulées"" et 8 mieleuses, voilà ce qu'on peut tirer de cet album . Des pistes comme "" Shadow of The day"" , ""Valentine's Day"", ou encore "" In Between"" sont tout simplement fades, sans relief, sans envie apparente . Mais il est passé où le groupe qui pondait un album avec 12 bombes sur 12 ?? Chester semble avoir perdu sa voix et sa masculinité , Mike est inexistant, le batteur est vraiment très mauvais ...Pour vous faire une idée, le single ""What I've Done"" ( que vous entendez 10 fois par jour sur NRJ .....) est une des chansons les plus violentes de l'album , une des moins ""chiantes"" à écouter . Vous êtes prévenus .. Un conseil , si vous êtes fans des 2 premiers albums, écoutez celui-ci AVANT de l'acheter, vous risqueriez ( comme moi ) d'avoir foutu 16€ en l'air pour un CD qui ne bougera plus de l'armoire .. Pour ceux qui veulent vraiment découvrir le groupe, je leur conseille de se pencher sur Hybrid Theory ou Meteora ..."
5,Des chansons qui sont toujours enivrantes et vous font voyager
1,"Je n'ai rien contre Ophélie Winter mais trop c'est trop!!! J'espère qu'un jour elle va arrêter de nous torturer avec sa musique. J'ai écouté l'album et je n'ai rien remarqué de très ""explicit""!! Ce qu'il l'est ce sont ses sappes, et son style de barbie anorexique... Quant à sa voix, elle me donne envie de me taper la tête contre les murs.."
2,"en effet, je suis déçue par cet album à tel point que je compte le revendre ou le donner."
1,"J'ai vu la demoiselle en avant en première partie d'Art Mengo il y a quelques années à l'Olympia, j'avoue que j'étais content que ça s'arrête. Ses mimiques de poupée à la limite du tic compulsif agacent. Je me suis vite ennuyé... Sa voix n'est pas désagréable mais le tout est insipide, assez banal, sans intérêts...."
5,"Une voix à faire frissonner, musique et contenu des textes en parfaite symbiose...l'album de cette vraie personnalité est à découvrir absolument !  Life is real et Help is coming sont de vrais chefs d'oeuvre !  Il ne faut pas s'arrêter à Down on my knees qui n'est pas la meilleure à mon avis.  En résumé un excellent album soul aux influences multiples, mêlé de reggae et folk."
5,"S'il n'en reste qu'un ce sera celui là ! Depuis que Shirley Manson, Butch et consors ont arrêté de se cacher derrière un mur d'effets spéciaux, ils assainent un rock sans faille ! Cet album percutant marque sans conteste une évolution dans le son de Garbage. A écouter : ""Androginy"" - le premier single."
5,"Je suis un fidèle de Mireille Mathieu, aussi ai-je acheté sans hésitation le nouveau Cd. Et je dois dire que cette confiance a été admirablement récompensée. Avec 'De Tes Mains', Mireille Mathieu signe un superbe album dans lequel je ne décèle aucune faiblesse: c'est du 'grand Mireille Mathieu' d'un bout à l'autre. La voix est là, bien sûr, puissante et pure, et mise en valeur par des orchestrations de premier ordre. Les textes sont soignés et sortent des sentiers battus; les mélodies magnifiques. L'intensité de l'interprétation parvient encore à nous couper le souffle sur certains titres (La Vie n'est plus la Vie sans Nous, Personne,...) Mireille Mathieu, servie par des auteurs et compositeurs qui ont cru en elle, se révèle plus magistrale que jamais. on ne peut qu'être séduit par cet album.  Un poète faisait remarquer que la 'modernité' mariait 'mode' et 'éternité', et en ce sens, 'De tes Mains' correspond tout à fait à cette définition: un album dans le goût du jour et qui pourtant restera indémodable, à l'image de la Demoiselle d'Avignon."
4,"tres bonne reprises...et surprise ce qui confirme son talent.. September - Earth wind &amp; Fire, groupe mythique des années 70 et 80.. Heartbreaker - Dionne Warrick (1984) chanson ecrite par les Beegees pour les reste c'est top techtonik electro"
2,"Oui, oui, ok, ok, tout ça c'est bien beau, mais vous trouvez qu'il sait chanter Darmon ?"
4,"Là c'est clair : Miss Knight se lance dans le rugueux... Et c'est tant mieux! Déjà, sur son album précédent, on pouvait sentir son penchant pour la pop-guitare (on se rappelle notamment du très beau ""Shoulda, Woulda, Coulda""). Celui-ci est aujourd'hui plus qu'affirmé, et elle le crie avec force. Pour preuve ? Le titre de ce sublime album ""Affirmation"". Investie à fond dans l'écriture de cet opus, avec quelques aides non négligeables (Guy Chambers ou Chris Martin, le leader de Coldplay) Beverley Knight semble avoir trouver sa voie. Et justement, quelle voix ! Et surtout, quelle musique ! On trouve de bons morceaux rock (toujours inspirés de la pure soul), avec notamment le désormais célèbre ""Come As You Are"". D'autres chansons plus langoureuses méritent également une écoute attentive. En bref, cet album est magnifique et très personnel. ""Affirmation"" est sans doute son meilleur travail à ce jour, secondé par un Guy Chambers toujours aussi inspiré. A écouter sans attendre !"
2,"Après le soporifique Medulla, je m'étais promis de ne plus acheter d'album de Bjork sans l'écouter avant. Chat échaudé... Mais cette fois encore je me suis laissé entrainé par le souvenir des compositions précédentes de la belle, du temps où elle se prenait moins au sérieux, et j'ai acheté Volta. Conclusion après de nombreuses écoutes: on sent encore les braises de l'artiste qui parvenait à conjuguer expérimentation et mélodies (avec ""Innocence"" par exemple), mais globalement cet album est un nouvel objet qu'on archive et qu'on oublie. Bjork peut à nouveau se caresser le nombril avec la satisfaction de faire des choses différentes de ce que l'on peut entendre par ailleurs. Ceux qui cherchent autre chose qu'un objet à afficher sur sa table de salon se tourneront vers les albums précédents, ceux du temps où Bjork prenait le risque de faire des chansons."
4,Je ne connaissais pas ce chanteur et recherchais le duo avec Calogéro... Je dois avouer que j'ai été séduite dès la première écoute!
2,"Je me suis dit génial il aura soit un son dvd nouvelle technologie, il ne passe pas sur ma chaine hi-fi, ni même dans ma voiture. C'est un cd que pour ordinateur et les lecteurs DVD. On se dit qu'on aura des images, on a le droit au texte fixe de la chanson ou, alors à deux petites images fixent selon l'option choisis. Quelle intérêt de mettre deux petites images, alors qu'on pourrait mettre des vidéos du groupes pendant les chansons. Le point fort c'est que l'on peut chanter les paroles sur la musique avec le chant du chanteur :-), sinon le cd est bien, mais je suis fustré de ne pas me passer de l'ordinateur ou de la télévision pour l'écouter. C'est un choix d'écoute particulier que l'on aime ou pas."
1,"This is perhaps the most puerile dribble I have heard. What it has is a seductive, strong drumbeat, hypnotically sucking the listener into a morass of silliness. Some of the lyrics are almost funny in their awkwardness, and verge on illiteracy. ""My friends say you're so into me And that you need me desperately They say you say we're so complete"" Worse yet is the cover of the Jagger/Richards ""(I Can't Get no) Satisfaction"", which is full of vocalized wiggles and oooh ahhh uhhhs in a girlish whisper."
5,"Une des meilleures amies de Sheryl Crow...elle a le talent, le charisme,la présence...bref, si vous ne connaissez pas encore le sublissime "" angel "" ( QUOI ?? VOUS NE CONNAISSEZ PAS ?? ) vous adorerez.Ce titre se réfère à l'excellent film "" la cité des anges "".A posséder urgamment..."
1,"Personnellement je n'ai pas vraiment aimé ce nouveau virage POP que prend Jewel sur cet album 0304. A l'écoute, les mélodies peuvent être agréables mais l'émotion est plutôt absente. Deux titres sont particulièrement formatés pour être des hits radio (""stand"" et ""intuition"") dans le même style qu'une Madonna ou qu'une Britney Spears. Les vrais amoureux de la musique de JEWEL choisiront plutôt d'acheter son dernier DVD ""Live at Humphrey's by the Bay"" qui est une réussite totale (*****). Ce chef d'oeuvre que je vous conseille donc fortement est l'un des DVD musicaux les plus émouvants que je connaisse. Mais, attention à justement ne pas confondre cet excellent DVD avec le précédent ""A Life Uncommon"" qui mérite par contre d'être oublié rapidement."
2,"Bon alors mouthfull... Au début j'ai détesté ce disque, surement parce que j'avais auparavant détesté les déclarations prétentieuse du leader obscure Dan qui en jazzeux obtus fustigeait la pop musique comme quoi c'était pas son domaine, c'était un art mineur ou tout avait été dit et fait etc... Et ce mec venait défendre un album de pure pop music, y a de quoi rire quand même... Donc en mélomane averti je jette une oreille à ce disque, pas désagréable, pas transcendant non plus, entre le folk rock de feist, le rock aride de pj harvey, influences boboistes s'il en est, rien de bien nouveau sous le soleil. Après quelques écoutes plus  approfondies, quelques moments vraiment savoureux ou les influences du jazzeux en question ressortent clairement pour transcender une vraie volonté de sortir des sentiers battus, ainsi ""coda"" renferment des moments de free noise strident dans le style des expérimentations de brian eno, ""Playground Hustle"" et ""Queen dot kong"" dament le pion à gwen steffani, et ""When was I last home ?"" nous rappelle le bien que fait une bonne chanson orchestrée soul jazz de catpower. Sinon, le seul vrai titre qui donnerait presque des frissons, c'est ""The bridge is broken"" avec sa mélodie lancinante et ses breaks instrumentaux dignes des talking heads autrement plus pertinent que le similaire et pourtant agaçant  ""On my shoulders""  qu'on entend maintenant partout, reflet d'un groupe consensuel au succès flagrant chez la jeunesse dorée en mal de nouvelles sensations rock, mais beaucoup moins évident pour ceux qui malheureusement pour dan écoutent beaucoup de pop music et prennent ça très au sérieux..."
4,"j'ai acheté ce coffret pour ma petite fille car sa mère était folle de chantal lorsqu'elle était enfant et comme je possède presques tous ses disques en vinyl et que je ne peux plus lui faire écouter j'ai acheté le CD et elle est ravie et malgré mon age avancé je me souviens très bien des paroles des chansons qui ont bercés toute l'enfance de ma fille, et ma petite fille les apprécie tout autant."
2,"Renaud s'essaye encore un peu à jouer les rebelles avec ses petites critiques (mignones), alors qu'il est lui meme devenu un bobo qui passe à la téloche faire sa promo alors qu'il critique la téloche : PAS CREDIBLE"
2,"Bon il nous refait le coup du chanteur énervé qui radote et qui dit parfois n'importe quoi , le tout avec son supplément de femme mais on l'aime bien car son talent lui fait rarement défaut; pour les inconditionnels....!!!"
1,Je ne comprends pas.
2,"Je fais me faire des ennemis, mais tant pis. Ce commentaire sera un peu particulier, dans la mesure où je ne commente, d`une part, habituellement que les produits que j'ai appréciés et, d'autre part, que je connais assez bien pour les avoir achetés. Ici, une fois n'est pas coutume, je vais commenter un produit pour lequel je n'aurais pas souhaité mettre de nombre d'étoiles (j'en mets deux, pour être cohérent avec ce que je vais expliquer maintenant, et parce que je suis quelqu'un de fondamentalement gentil). Mais je tenais à réagir à ce que j'ai vu samedi soir à l'occasion de la remise des « Victoires de la musique ». Je ne connaissais pas du tout ce chanteur. Arrivé sur scène, j'ai plutôt été séduit par le style et trouvais a priori la musique rock assez plaisante. Jusqu'à ce que ce chanteur se mette à vociférer une succession de propos haineux et gratuits du type « Avoir une action, c'est avoir du sang sur les mains » ou « Total avec ses 12 milliards de bénéfices... » (on imagine la suite. Mais sans doute préfère-t-il les entreprises qui dégagent des pertes, parfois colossales, et se voient contraintes à regrets de licencier massivement ?). Pourquoi certains artistes se sentent-ils obligés de parler ainsi de politique, au lieu de défendre leur oeuvre ou créer quelque chose de positif ? Certes, l'artiste peut avoir ses opinions et même souhaiter les défendre, mais pourquoi hors de propos ? Et avec si peu d'originalité et une manifeste méconnaissance totale (sans mauvais jeu de mots) de son sujet ? Cela s'appelle tout simplement de la facilité et même de la paresse intellectuelle. Que ce jeune homme soit révolté et dépassé par les événements, soit. Mais voilà, beaucoup d'artistes aiment à se donner un style. Quel dommage, dis-je en titre, car à l'écoute des quelques extraits proposés ici, je ne retrouve pas l'excité sanguinaire que j'ai vu sur mon écran samedi. Plutôt quelqu'un qui aurait été tout à fait digne d'intérêt pour moi s'il n'avait pas tout gâché par cet emportement absurde et sans intérêt. Pardonnons-lui cette attitude d'un jour. C'est un homme encore jeune et bouleversé, manifestement complètement dépassé par les événements et victime du monde dans lequel il vit. Mais il serait souhaitable qu'il gagne en maturité rapidement et essaye de comprendre ce monde pour cesser de se présenter en victime et faire preuve de propositions concrètes s'il ne veut pas que ses assertions se contentent d'être gratuites, stériles et sans aucun effet (à moins, je le répète, que ce ne soit tout simplement qu'une situation toujours très confortable, celle de se poser en victime, en révolté, qui fait mine de défendre les petites gens, ce qui rend toujours populaire et s'appelle de la démagogie). Je ne puis que lui conseiller (même si je ne me fais bien sûr aucune illusion) de lire ce petit ouvrage simple (par exemple), mais fondé sur des chiffres et faits avérés, qui pourrait lui réserver de sacrées surprises : « 101 idées reçues sur l'Economie ». Après cela, oui il pourrait davantage être apte à parler librement, mais en connaissance de cause. L'ignorance a tué, parfois très massivement, tue et continuera de tuer. C'est pourquoi je prends ces choses-là au sérieux. Un artiste certainement sympathique pour ses admirateurs et, à l'entendre au fil des extraits, qui semble digne d'intérêt. Mais pourquoi tout gâcher ainsi ? Quel dommage ! Chers stars, chanteurs, acteurs et vedettes en tout genre, cessez de nous ennuyer avec vos vraies ou (le plus souvent) fausses révoltes. Ce ne sont souvent que des postures et cela ne mène le plus souvent à rien."
1,"Trés bon album même si les grincheux le trouve 1 peut "" show bizz "", on passe du PUNK ROCK au slow cool en moins de 3 minutes et on ne s'ennuie jamais , encore du GRAND GREEN DAY ."
1,"Voila : je suis un fan de MEGADETH. Mon conseil est simple. Ecoutez bien des extraits avant de lacher vos euros. Après 20 ans d'attente, on pouvait espérer mieux que d'essayer d'entendre Mustaine baver maladroitement dans son micro... Mais ceux qui ont déjà vu le groupe en concert comprendront pourquoi ils se sont abstenus si longtemps d'éditer un live ! La magnifique Set-list fait vite place à une géante déception. Les autres n'auront qu'à écouter l'album pour se convaincre. Désolé, mais c'est pas avec celui-ci que vous allez découvrir un super son ou un mixage détonant.   S'il vous plaît, rachetez moi mon album..."
1,"Jean Pascal : vaste problématique ! Le dogme musical dans toute sa splendeur !!! On fait croire que c'est bien, mais en fait, c'est de la m.... Ah, le pouvoir des médias ! Faire passer l'auditeur pour un bênet, une vache à lait. Ouvrons les yeux !!! Refusons la pensée unique que nous imposent les chaînes privées et les majors du disque. Vive la diversité culturelle, vive la recherche musicale, vive les instuments, vive le TALENT !!! Assez de Jean Pascal, Jennifer, Félicien et autres. Au nom de la musique, arrêtons-ça pendant qu'il en est encore temps !!!"
1,"je ne pense pas qu'il existe de mauvais albums contrairement à certains,tout dépend de quel point de vue on se place(celui de l'adolescent,ou celui de l'artiste expérimenté). Le plus objectivement possible,on ne peut pas dire que cet album soit une perle,d'ailleurs comment serait-ce possible quand il a été enregistré en si peu de temps? Ensuite quand je vois certains dire que ça change de Goldman,ou d'autres grands de la chanson française!!!Mon dieu! Comment peuvent-ils oser?Ces gens-là ont-ils oublier les 2Be3?non ça ne change de rien du tout,c'est toujours pareil.Toujours la même musique,et ceux qui ne sont pas d'accord n'ont qu'à s'acheter d'anciens cd des 2be3 ou des spice girls,et ils verront si ça change... Mais que peut-on faire?ça fait de l'argent et c'est comme ça.Les jeunes ne voudront pas comprendre parce que c'est leur style de musique. Sachez tout de meme,s'il y en a qui me lisent,que je suis aussi jeune(18 ans quand meme),que j'ai déjà écouté cette sorte de musique,et je pense que la vraie musique,celle qui vous plait ne peut pas etre celle là,parce qu'elle est trop impersonnelle,on ne ressent pas grand chose avec. Le mieux c'est de trouver des styles plus précis, le reggae ,la techno,le metal,tout ce que vous voulez tant que ça vous fait frissonner de plaisir! Oui moi je frissonne de plaisir quand j'écoute mes solos de metal,vous vous frissonnerez de plaisir pour d'autres styles de musique, mais vous ne frissonnerez jamais pour popstars je vous le dis."
5,"Je trouvais le premier pas mauvais mais alors celui ci y a pas photo, il est super!!!!!!Je vouse le conseil vivement!!!!"
1,"elle chante comme un canard. je trouve que son succès est incompréhensible, n'importe quelle chanteuse d'une chorale gospel peut faire mieux qu'elle..."
2,"Ecoutez ou ré-écoutez Brian ENO/David BYRNE/talking heads en 1980 soit près de 10 ans + tôt ... (moutain needles, overload)... étonnant non ? une chose est sûre, E. Serra n'écoute pas n'importe quoi."
2,"A l'image du dernier Korn ""Issues"", il semble que le succès ramolisse la musique des groupes hard (!?) américains ou plutôt la rende accessible à un plus large public. Force est de constater qu'avec ""Californication"", les Red Hot ont entamé un sérieux virage commercial. Certes, il est vrai que l'on pouvait trouver dans les précédents albums des RHCP des morceaux calmes et sirupeux tels ""Under The Bridge"", ""Aeroplane"" ou encore ""My Friends""; mais ils n'étaient pas majoritaires tout au long de l'album comme c'est le cas dans ""Californication"". Mis à part 2 ou 3 morceaux (l'excellent ""Get On Top"" notamment), les Red Hot apparaissent comme assagis ou même vieillis sur cet album. Où est donc passée la magie qui faisait des Red Hot les grands maîtres du Hard/Funk à l'époque pas si lointaine des ""Blood Sugar Sex Magic"" ou ""One Hot Minute"" ? Aujourd'hui, les critiques musicaux classent les Red Hot dans la catégorie groove, ce qui n'est pas à leur honneur vu l'uniformité de ce que la quasi-totalité des radios nous impose et qui porte le nom de groove."
5,"Avec ses 2 CD d'environ 70 min chacun, cet album nous transporte complètement dans l'esprit du film. A chaque ecoute, c'est comme si l'on revoyait le film dans sa tête. En plus, l'album est enregistré d'après la version remasterisé ce qui nous apporte plus de surprise (ex: jedi rocks)! Bref, ce sont les vrais musiques comme on les aime, la décéption ne peut survenir même pour les amateurs de STAR WARS! Encore Merci à J.Williams !"
4,"J'avoue que je ne connaissais pas cet artiste, seulement entendu parler de lui j'ai donc acheté son best off et on peux dire que cela a été une confirmation de ce que j'avais entendu sur lui et sur son oeubre un grand monsieur, des sons qui vous permettront de voyager dans ce fascinant continent qu'est l'afrique. Une tres belle voix, une musique travaillée. Un excellent CD"
2,Impatient de voir  l'intérieur du livret quelle ne fut pas ma déception ! composé de quelques pages blanches sur lesquelles ont été ajoutées à la sauvette quelques accroches de presse on a peu la sensation de s'être fait floué à peine apprend t-on à quelle date ont été conçu les morceaux et avec qui Ce qui est frappant c'est l'absence de photos ou de visuels pour un artiste comme Daho qui dans le passé a beaucoup soigné ses pochettes  Enfin le portrait sur le coffret est superbe merci Nick Knight et la musique est douce et ennivrante
5,"Quel est le plus grand disque de Led Zep? Le II, le IV, ou celui-ci? Débat inutile me direz-vous... Quoi que. Il m'arrive en tout cas assez souvent d'opter pour le III car il contient toutes les facettes du Zep à son meilleur. Immigrant song pour l'attaque dévastatrice, Since I've been loving you pour le blues, Tangerine pour le côté ""Stones"", mais surtout Gallows Pole ou Bron Y Aur stomp pour cette façon hallucinante qu'a Jimmy page de réinventer l'esprit folk. Que le doute me prenne et je pose la galette. Le cri déchirant de Robert Plant accueille le rif imparable de Jimmy Page et l'évidence s'impose, qui ne sera plus démentie jusqu'au terme de l'album: le III de Led zep est tout simlement le plus grand disque de rock'n roll."
2,"Je possède quelques CD de Buddy Guy dont je suis un grand admirateur. Cet artiste nous avait habitué à balancer de vrais disques de blues, puis par la suite de blues-rock de grande qualité. Je me suis donc empressé d'acheter ce dernier opus. Bien que la qualité artistique soit correcte, Buddy semble dériver vers le ""blues funck"". Pour conclure, je dirai que ce CD n'est pas mauvais mais certainement décevant pour les amateurs de blues de Buddy GUY."
5,"Une interpretation inégalée, des voix sublimes, un souffle romantique lié à une grande précicion musicologique. Si on ne doit posséder qu'une seule version de cette oeuvre, c'est sans conteste celle ci qu'il faut acquérir."
5,"La musique du film moulin rouge est tout a fait féerique et magnifique ,les acteurs chantent merveilleusement bien et les chansons sont tout a fait époustouflantes, le second cd vient a merveille compléter le premier!A mon avis les plus belles chansons de ce CD sont ""Roxanne"" et ""Come what may"" et sur le cd 2 ""the show must go on"" mais vraiment si vous n'avez pas vu Mouli Rouge allez le voir !"
1,mon voisin a acheté ce disque et se le passe en boucle. Je pense à déménager ou lui offrir Miossec.
1,"une fois décédé, c'est à ce moment qu'il vend le plus, c un peu malheureux quelque part mais pr être honnête, cela ne casse pas la baraque...loin de là..."
4,"La ""Femme Trombone"" reprend avec brio les ficelles de l'électro bricolo de Cool Frénésie, avec une Catherine au chant toujours aussi fiévreux et passionné. les paroles sont de plus en plus recherchées, vraiment rien à voir avec l'époque de ""The no Coprendo"". la plus belle chanson est le ""Triton"". Ruez vous dans les salles de concert, car ils assurent sacrément."
5,"C'est une merveille de perfection. Jamais une voix, des paroles et des mélodies ne se sont aussi bien mariées. Céline exprime tout son feeling à travers ces 12 moments de pur bonheur. Céline est vraiment arrivée à trouver sa voix, son timbre n'a jamais été plus pur qu'ici. C'est un album qui accompagnera tous vos moments, vos joies comme vos tristesse. A acheter et même réacheter si vous le voulez."
5,"JJG est un immense artiste. Véritable machine à écrire des tubes, il a fait une carrière atypique, évitant sans cesse les médias, là où les autres leurs courent après. A un moment de sa carrière, il souhaite revenir à ses origines rock, et à privilégier l'aspect ""groupe"" au détriment de son statut de chanteur star. Pour ce faire, il s'entoure de son guitariste solo et d'une choriste soliste rencontrée durant un ""boeuf"" sur scène. Admirable de laisser son statut de superstar pour privilégier une collectivité musicale. Après un magnifique et intimiste album (Nuit), on le retrouve sur ""Rouge"", un album tiré au cordeau, magnifiquement orchestré et accompagné pour une chanson des chœurs de l'Armée Rouge. Un son rock mais clair, des voix à leur apothéose, des solos guitares de qualité, bref, un bel album de rock français, qui fera date, avec de petites perles comme "" Juste Après"", ou comme ""Des Vies"", chanson très inspirée par les rythmes de Dire Straits. A mon sens, la pierre angulaire de son œuvre. A prix doux..."
4,"Etant une très grande Fan de Roch Voisine, depuis longtemps, je dois reconnaître que cet album est surprenant de douceur et de maturité. Merci Roch pour cette merveille et nous attendons le prochain"
1,Le grand Jacques doit se retourner dans sa tombe -pagny chantant Brel c'est un peu comme si sabine paturel chantait tina turner - c'est atroce mes oreilles saignent lorsque je l'entends a la pub - tout ça pour faire un max de thunes -pauvre pagny tu fais pitié
2,"Je suis assez déçu du fait qu'il manque le morceau ""Peut-être une angine"". Cela veut-il dire que lorsqu'un album est moins cher on enlève des morceaux? Drôle de méthode........ Je serai désormais plus attentif sur le site d'Amazon."
1,"Voulzy, on l'aime bien ... sympa, modeste, toujours prêt à une bonne émission de TV populaire, je l'ai vu en tournée et j'ai aimé (a Arras... ville dynamique de la musique !!)... Mais là j'avoue que quand j'ai écouté le disque je me suis senti volé... volé parce que la pub TV en permanence, le disque chez mon marchand de journaux et surtout parce que le contenu n'est qu'un gloubi boulga de réchauffé. Ce disque devrait être vendu au rayons bonnes affaires des CD invendus....parce que c'est se moquer du monde."
2,"Il est vrai que cet album comporte vraiment tous les ingrédients pour plaire... mais je ne peux pas m'empêcher de penser à radiohead. Je trouve qu'on force le trait de la sensibilité (blackout, apocalypse please) l'âme qu'ils veulent nous retranscrire dans leurs mélodies ne me convint pas. Que nous ammènent-ils de plus? on peut s'inspirer mais pas plagier."
5,"je pense qu'un des mots qui qualifient le mieux cet album est : énorme . C'est la première fois que j'entends un tel mélange de genres...Rock/rap/groovy.......certaines chansons font un peu penser au style des black eyed peas pour ceux qui connaissent mais tout de même un cran au dessus . Un album brillant de bout en bout mais en même temps trés diversifié : On a parfois du mal a reconnaitre la voix qu'on a entendu dans ""Crazy"" ! N'importe laquelle des chansons de cet album ferait un carton plein en single mais je donne un certain avantage a ""Smiley faces"", ""Gone daddy gone"" et ""The last time"" . Dernier point, ce n'est pas un album ""long"" la plupart des chansons font moins de 3 minutes mais au vu de la qualité de la musique...ce n'est pas trés important . Depuis hier je l'écoute en boucle et en boucle on ne s'en lasse jamais !"
2,"Ca commence bien. Ritournelle de synthé cheap, voix sexy en diable de Karen O, qui en rappelle d'autre, et riffs bien sentis, ""Rich"", poisseux, sexuel. Quelques doutes sur une partie bruitiste au milieu du morceau suivant. Ca se gâte, encore du bruit, surtout pour rien, morceau courts, auxquels on ne fait pas attention, ça crie un peu trop pour attirer l'attention. T'es pas Polly d'abord. Ca fait beaucoup de manières... ""Black Tongue"", ouf, ça martèle dur, Karen chante comme une Chryssie dépravée, bonne mélodie, son rapeux mais dansant. Puis ça reprend, encore de mou, ou plutôt du dur, bruyant, brouillon, ça ressemble à rien, ou plutôt ça ressemble à trop de chose, mais en pas terrible. Quand ça se calme enfin, de la mélodie, joli ""Maps"", avec encore ce son de synthé en arrière, qui colore le tout. Karen O ferait mieux de chanter, ""Y Control"" noisy mais controlé et la douce ""Modern Romance"" valent mieux que le tintamarre inutile de la plupart du reste de l'album."
5,"Effectivement, ces lads de Sheffield ont l'air tout droit sortis d'un pub. Un pub qui doit être bien prolo et rempli de bière si on en juge par la dégaine de ces jeunes gens. Ces singes de l'Arctique avaient mis leurs titres en disponibilité sur le net bien avant la sortie de l'album. Le résultat est brut de décoffrage et file une pêche d'enfer. ""I bet you look good on the dancefloor"" ainsi que ""The view from the Afternoon"" sont imparables et terriblement dansant. Des titres plus calmes mais non moins bons parsèment l'opus comme ""Riot van"" ou ""A certain Romance"". Le titre ""Mardy Bum"" au songwriting intelligent rappelle immédiatement The Libertines. Ce groupe ne manquera évidemment pas d'être décrier comme tout groupe issue de l'Indé qui accède au Mainstream. N'empêque qu'il met une bonne claque à Pete Doherty et sa bande de Babyshambles."
1,"Ils recyclent certains de leurs anciens titres accompagnés par l'orchestre d'Islande. Aucune créativité. Les voix sont parfois couvertes par la musique qui se veut ""lyrique"" et est plutôt emphatique. Keren Ann cultive, d'ordinaire, une sobriété délicate et une épure émouvante.  Le livret ne nous propose même pas les textes des chansons déjà anciennes. Seuls les titres sont indiqués au dos du CD."
5,"Je pense que peu de gens peuvent apprécier ce Cd car cette musique ne ressemble à rien de ce qui se fait en europe ou aux usa. C'est une autre culture musicale qui a ""pondu"" ce disque et les oreilles d'européens qui cherchent à trouver un repere dedans, c'est pour eux assez difficile. Mais cela se comprend. Certains vont l'adorer comme moi, d'autres ne vont rien y trouver d'interressant. En tout cas je pense que ce Cd ne passera pas inapercu."
5,Après avoir écouté cet enregistrement vous vous direz que vous n'aviez jamais entendu les Quatre Saisons.
2,"Pour son premier enregistrement verdien, on peut dire que l'on attendait Harnoncourt au tournant. D'une manière générale, le résultat est plutôt convaincant malgré des tempi parfois incompréhensiblement lents (cette version dure en moyenne 15 minutes de plus que la plupart des autres enregistrements), mettant en péril certains chanteurs (Salminen). Le Philarmonique de Vienne révéle de manière somptueuse certains passages de la partition. Côté chanteurs : Hampson et Borodina sont extraordinaires. Aïda et Radamès ? Il n'en y a point : Cristina Gallardo Domas a ruiné, en peu de temps, des moyens considérables. La voix sonne courte, étriquée, affligée d'un large vibrato.  Vincenzo La Scola est-il un Radamès ? A aucun moment le chanteur ne nous convainc qu'il incarne un valeureux guerrier : la voix est crispée, engorgée, le chant sans style, sans ligne, sans panache, parfois à la limite de la justesse (la reprise de ""Celeste Aïda"" !!!).  En somme, une Aïda qui vaut pour son orchestre et ses seconds rôles..."
1,"Je suis étonné par cet enregistrement, qui est à l'encontre du côté religieux et solennel qu'exige cette musique, tout d'abord la voix de Daniels est plus qu'approximative et de plus il y a ce maniérisme qui déforme la retenue nécessaire, l'accompagement est correct, en bref rien d'extraordinaire contrairement à l'enregistrement de James Bowman et de l'Académie of Ancient Music, là tout y est une voix pure sans aucun artifice qui vous met les larmes aux yeux,un Bowman au mieux de sa forme,l'accompagnement de Hoghwood est superbe, en tout un Stabat Mater et un Nisi Dominus qui vous envahissent de bonheur"
1,"Franchement, qui est capable d'écouter tout un disque de musique de Bach interprété par Gould? Dès les premières mesures, on est saisi d'un ennui distingué. Colette avait dit de la musique de Bach ""quelle jolie machine à coudre""! Gould ne nous guérit pas de ces idées reçues et nous y fait même patauger. Le pianiste n'est jamais techniquement pris en défaut: je reconnais sans problème l'exceptionnelle maîtrise musicale. Le problème est que la musique de Bach en ressort déformée: chaque variation est en relation avec un rythme de danse très particulier, une forme musicale typiquement baroque qui implique un phrasé, un rythme adapté. Or, Gould, est hors de ce système de pensée (normal pour son époque). Il applique la même technique à une sonate de Haydn où à la troisième variation des Goldberg, niant par ce biais toutes les spécificités de la musique, sa nature même. Lorsque Bach composait pour un clavecin à double clavier, il connaissait parfaitement les ressources et les limites de son instrument. Faisons- lui confiance..."
5,"Ecouter cet album est une expérience douloureuse tant le talent s'y déploie avec une force et une intensité qui nous font d'autant plus regretter Elliott Smith. Evidemment influencé par les Beatles et les Kinks, Smith prouve avec un disque comme celui-ci prouve qu'une bonne mélodie bien arrangé est intemporelle et se situe au-delà des modes. Cet album est peut-être le plus bel album de songwriter paru à la fin des années 90 : 14 chansons pop-rock, aux mélodies envoutantes et avec un lyrisme et une énergie peu commune.  Des arrangements subtils et aux sonorités très travaillés : on ne lasse pas de l'entrée du piano dans Pitseleh et de ces basses rondes qui donnent une assise et une profondeur aux morceaux de Smith (une de ses marques de fabrique), sans oublier la voix de Smith - poignante, qui apporte une mélancolie sur des textes dont la noirceur pouvait laisser présager la fin tragique de Smith. A découvrir de toute urgence, un de ces disques évidents dont on se demande comment on a fait pour s'en passer auparavant !"
5,"Surprenant de voir que ce cd n'a pas encore été commenté, car il est très réussi. Comme tous les disques inspirés, on le découvre au fil des écoutes, et rapidement les mélodies ne nous lâchent plus. Une subtile légèreté..."
2,"De bons morceaux, d'autres plus quelconques. Mais surtout, je me fais plus à la voix de Bob, décidément trop nasillarde. Dommage."
5,"Un ""retour"" après plusieurs années sans album de Gov't Mule, Warren Haynes montre tous ses talents et a toujours une voix magnifique et un vrai talent dans les doigts. A écouter en boucle les soirs d'hiver près du feu ou sous la pluie avec le baladeur, ça redonne chaud au coeur ! :)"
1,"Dylan nous avait habitué à mieux avant, et heureusement il a fait mieux depuis... Le creux de sa vague était justifié. Ne faites pas comme moi, choisissez un autre Dylan, il y en a tant de très bons!"
5,"Dans cet enregistrement de septembre 1967 réédité par cette parution nipponne, Ernest Ansermet desserre l'étau psychodramatique de l'oeuvre pour mieux mettre en valeur la poétique sonore de l'instrumentation berliozienne, savoureusement flattée par l'orchestre helvétique (cordes moelleuses, cuivres timbrés, clarinettes crémeuses, flûtes opalines, basson goguenard...) qui alanguit les langueurs énamourées des ""rêveries et passions"" en dissipant leur fougue.  Mordorée de couleurs pastorales, la ""scène aux champs"" baigne dans un chaleureux climat automnal.  La direction profonde du chef suisse reste constamment aérée et limpide, voire angélique dans une ""marche au supplice"" finement ouvragée qui sentimentalise le martyre psychédélique imaginé par le compositeur.  Cédant quelque peu au pathos, le ""songe d'une nuit de sabbat"" verse dans le funèbre plutôt que dans la fantasmagorie macabre.  L'imagerie délirante de la « Fantastique » tend à se dissoudre dans ce style euphémistique qui lui préserve, à l'instar des versions de Cluytens, Beecham ou Kegel, un pouvoir d'évocation très émouvant.  Il n'y avait guère qu'Ansermet pour conférer à cet symphonie emblématique du romantisme français un tel supplément d'âme."
5,"Ce disque est le volume II des Sonates et partitas pour violon seul de Bach enregistrées par Hélène Schmitt sur instrument d’époque et, comme le premier, il est absolument exceptionnel. Hélène Schmitt, est en effet l’une des très rares violonistes à être vraiment capable de dépasser les pièges de la virtuosité et de la démonstration gratuite pour nous faire atteindre une émotion pure qui n’a pas de prix. Evitant toute sécheresse, cherchant constamment l’émotion, le chant le plus intense, mais en jouant toujours avec la plus grande maîtrise et sobriété, Hélène Schmitt prend son temps et nous conduit de beautés en beautés, d’émerveillement en émerveillement. Ainsi, des 6 versions de ces œuvres que je possède (Yehudi Menuhin (1934-1936, Emi) ; Sandor Végh (1970, Auvidis-Valois) ; Nathan Milstein (1973, DG) ; Sigiswald Kuijken I et II (1981 et 1999-2000 DHM) et Hélène Schmitt (2004, Alpha)), celle-ci est sans aucun doute l’une des plus profondes et essentielles : aussi engagée et émouvante que celle de Sandor Végh, aussi délicate et sensible que celles de Sigiswald Kuijken, mais inouïe par son absolue simplicité et par la pureté de son chant. Tous les amateurs de musique véritable en sortiront grandis et bouleversés."
2,"dans l'interprétation de ces rhapsodies hongroises on a déjà fait beaucoup mieux, je suis très déçue par ce CD, le problème est que l'on ne peux pas retourner un cd ouvert!"
2,"Ce CD m'a beaucoup décue, pas par la qualité des exécutions,  mais par les qualités techniques de la prise de son.Les aigus apparaissent mal, ce qui  enlève beaucoup de la vivacité  de la musique."
5,"Outre ses qualités de compositeur, Haendel fut, on le sait moins, un claveciniste et un organiste prodigieux. Seulement, il exerça davantage son art du clavier dans l'interprétation et l'improvisation que dans l'écriture. C'est donc avec une attention toute particulière et un plaisir non dissimulé que nous abordons ces six concertos pour orgue, d'autant qu'ils nous propulsent à un niveau d'excellence qui ne devrait pas passer inaperçu. Dans un style qui allie le faste, la liberté et la fraîcheur, ils s'offrent, pour ce disque, les services d'un organiste des plus émérites, Lorenzo Ghielmi. Lumineuse, son interprétation est d'une souplesse et d'une allure qui sous-entendent parfaitement les qualités d'improvisateur de leur auteur. En cela, il est soutenu par un ensemble pertinent aux proportions idéales. Divina Armonia n'a pas volé son nom. Malgré des dimensions assez réduites, toujours dans les meilleures dispositions, il recèle de tout en abondance, et c'est fort intelligemment qu'il autorise le Concerto en si bémol à retrouver sa configuration d'origine qui le réservait alors à la harpe et à l'archiluth. À la faveur d'une prise de son précise et spacieuse, les timbres des instruments sont fidèlement reproduits, sans saturation ni contraste exagéré. Ils s'étalent dans un espace sonore à l'acoustique tout à la fois valorisante et respectueuse. Aussi, sans forcément chercher à nuire aux versions de Koopman ou de Pinnock, cet enregistrement chamboule néanmoins l'ordre établi. Il se place finalement comme un sacré concurrent, et à l'heure du choix la perfection technique de ce petit bijou risque bien de faire pencher la balance de son côté. Une juste récompense, en somme."
5,Sparkle Horse chante avec ses tripes. C'est un peu le petit frere de Vic Chesnutt en moins rapeux (et desepere) et plutot melancolique. La revolte interieure gronde. Quel bel album. Si vous aimez les voix qui s'arrachent a l'individu et les melodies ecorchees achetez. Meme les plus enerves d'entre nous pourrons se laisser seduire. Les artistes n'ayant pas oublie que les mots et la musique ne sont pas les seuls ingredients d'une bonne chanson sont rares. Linkous redefinit le sens du mot interprete.
2,"Franchement ce n'est pas le meilleur album de Kery James : au niveau lyrics c'est pas mal , mais par contre les instrus sont pas terribles , car ce sont des classics americains pris et repris , ou des samples de tubes anciens ( sweet dreamns pour le track avec Amel Bent ). Dj Mehdi m'a franchement deçu pour l'instru de ""Je revendique "" . Au lieu de sortir cet album , ils auraient du réediter  ""Le Combat Continue "" d'Ideal J ( car cet album culte est introuvable ) et même mieux sortir un coffret avec "" Le Combat Continue "" et ""Original MC's sur une mission "" car sa ferait plaisir aux personnes qui collectionnent les classiques du rap français. ( il devraient pouvoir sortir un coffret car NTM, la FF, Sniper l'ont bien fait !)."
4,"Un album de rap français sans appels à la violence, sans apologie des trafics et de la haine du flic, sans trip proxénète, sans le sexe prêt à consommer ? Ce ne sont pas forcément ceux qui passent le plus sur les radios, pas ceux qui attirent le plus les branleurs et ceux que tentent les appels à la haine, toujours plus faciles à entendre quand on est en colère mais ces albums existent. En voici un. Il sauve un peu la vision d'ensemble du hip hop français. « J'suis pas là pour leur dire ce qu'ils veulent entendre » dit Kery James. Il analyse son propre parcours entre chronique social, témoignage et analyse. Ce n'est pas un album moralisateur mais un rappel à l'essentiel. Pensez aux conséquences de vos actes, à vos familles, à la fragilité de la vie... C'est un album sur l'espoir qui peut sortir même du plus sombre abîme. Musicalement, le flow un peu découpé de Kery James peut surprendre tout d'abord mais ça devient vite son empreinte. Si vous n'aimez pas le hip hop français car vous le jugez comme moi peu original, gavant, pauvre en paroles et en recherche musicale, cet album vous réconciliera peut-être avec la scène française. Arrangements intéressants, excellentes lyrics (Réfléchi, intelligent), utilisation de sonorités africaines ou cubaines, grosse utilisation des voix et du chant a capela. A écouter d'urgence : Si C'était à Refaire (magnifique), La Honte (ici on ne cherche d'excuses à la dérive), Deux Issues (très sombre, frappante, limite horrorcore), Cessez Le Feu (« c'est un appel à la paix »), Y'a Pas d'Couleur (tous des êtres humains). Pour les amateurs, Déséquilibre (un duo avec les Nubians). On peut être critique sans faire l'apologie de la violence, du sexe et de l'auto-destruction. Au fait, nos hommes politiques écoutent-ils ce style d'artistes avant de jeter de l'huile sur le feu ? Ils devraient... Une critique néanmoins, un dieu à peu trop présent alors qu'hypothétique et qu'il représente lui aussi une non solution."
4,"Des chansons documents-films sur les indiens, des ballades comme celle connue ""BALLADE OF IRA HAYES"" mais ici avec une intensité plus particulière. Quoique l'enregistrement soit ancien l'ensemble à bien vieilli et Johnny avait déjà cette voix grave... Ici pas de chansons ""Tube"" , ce CD avec Thrue story of the West constituent mais une partie de l'histoire de l'ouest."
1,superbe galette d'une music spatio intemporelle avec des images qui font voyager loin. ENCORE BRAVO aux musiciens et à leur subtil humour La Jamaique est toute petite sur le globe mais rares sont les pingouins qui ignorent qu'elle est grande dans notre coeur.
5,"1977 sort un disque intemporel par le monstre sacrée qu'est Muddy Waters. La première qualité de cet album est sans contexte la force de Muddy Waters à créer des refrains intemporels, des titres qui nous restent dans la tête toute la journée (Mannish Boy), des mélodies prenantes et émouvantes (Bus Driver / Deep Down In Florida). A cela,  il faut ajouter la voix mythique rauque et chaude, l'une des plus puissantes du blues. Il y a également la présence sur certains titres d'un piano, dont les partitions sont impressionnantes ajoutant l'émotion au blues de Muddy Waters avec l'ambiance lourde fournie par les rythmiques de la batterie lente et typique du Chicago blues. Si vous voulez y ajouter une émotion plus intense, reportez-vous sur le live   !  Vous pouvez également vous porter sur son fils, Big Bill Morganfield, pour vivre un chicago blues plus contemporain avec son premier disque  . Durée : 46minutes - 9Titres."
5,"Ce CD est vraiment magnifique. Un grand coup de chapeau pour tout l'album mais surtout le premier morceau Lovin' in my baby's eyes que j'adore(il me fait un peu penser à du Bob Dylan). Le reste est tout aussi génial, avec des morceaux plus rhythmés et moins rhythmés. Enfin c'est du tout bon comme d'habitude avec taj mahal."
1,Avishai Cohen m'ennuie. C'est certainement un très bon musicien. Mais ses interprétions me laissent de marbre ... froid et gris.
1,"Ploum ploum ratatatsoin ! James Horner est de retour ! Le vilain petit canard d'Hollywood, le pilleur de talents, le forcené de la BO ratée, le scribouillard des partitions revient avec une tentative de musique bruyante, pompeuse, à la mélodie (mais en est-ce vraiment une ?) insupportable, bref euh... c'est raté, quoi ! (encore une ! Ca lui en fait combien à lui ?). Il tente vainement de reprendre les mêmes recettes que Hans Zimmer dans Gladiator (oh, plein de cors ! euh et puis oh, une madame un peu orientale qui fait des vocalises et oh, aussi tout plein de tambours qui font des gros bruits qui font peur...) mais ne parvient qu'à être ridicule. Quand je pense que c'est notre autrement talentueux Gabriel Yared qui était sur le projet et qui s'est fait remercier... En fait je suis déçu, je voulais noter zéro étoile mais on peut pas, on doit en mettre au moins une. Donc, sachez que pour moi, c'est zéro étoile (et un et deux et Troie ? zéro !). En résumé, une BO à oublier très vite. Courage, fuyez..."
1,"Où est passé le chanteur de la nouvelle star ? Ou est passé son humour ? Trois chansons sur 14 sont assez bonnes, le reste est triste, surfait et les textes sont prétentieux et incompréhensibles. Je suis vraiment déçu"
1,"Je viens de decouvrir ce cd par les extraits ci dessus... ???? ok il chante, il ya de la musique, des textes? BOF vraiment aucun interret, et alors la reprise de ""SS en Hurruguay"" lamentable... je ne vis pas en France, mais je suppose que ce produit est matraque sur les radio et tv... en final cela ne casse pas trois pattes a un canard Francis"
1,"On peut dire qu'ils n'ont pas changé, c'est encore et toujours la même chose. Les chansons se ressemblent et se suivent. Il y en a qui aiment et qui aiment pas. Les paroles et messages sont quand a eux tres murs et ce n'est pas pour déplaire."
5,"c'est du tout bon.de l'excellentissime même.un album très varié avec des chefs d'oeuvres comme ""Paris""ou ""Cinq sens"".Ils s'activent et on se cultive,merçi à eux."
5,"Un album hard core avec des instrus parfaites.Les 2 groupes 2bal et 2neg se completent a merveilles meme si les 2bal sont,d'après moi, superieurs.Un album reussit a l'image du morceaux Labirhynte:un classique.Objectif reussit donc:3x plus efficace. Une performence encore inegalé"
5,"J'écris ce commentaire en ayant déjà dans les oreilles ""Si c'était à refaire..."", le dernier album du même Kery J. Cet album est bien évidemment L'ALBUM DE RAP FRANCAIS A POSSEDER. Avec IDEAL J, Kery James était à l'époque dans le rap Hardcore (titre d'une chanson de l'album d'ailleurs), dans le rap où les lyrics sont violents. Des lyrics en plus dynamités par la voix colèreuse de mister Kery, d'où un impact direct des paroles. Kery James est le leader de IDEAL J et les rappeurs de la MAFIA K'1'FRY (ROHFF, 113...) viennent poser leur voix sur des instru' aussi violentes que les paroles. Violence, violence dans les paroles mais beaucoup de vérité aussi. C'est un rejet du système français, dû à un vécu douloureux de chaque rappeur. Dans cet album figuraient déjà quelques morceaux mythiques du rap français (HARDCORE, J'AI MAL AU COEUR, L'AMOUR). FRANCHEMENT CA FAIT DU BIEN D'ECOUTER DES GARS QUI ""CRACHENT"" LES PAROLES : du bon rap à l'ancienne comme on ne fera plus je pense!!! A posséder OBLIGE!! Même si Kery a su calmer beaucoup de jeunes avec son dernier album, celui-ci laisse à réfléchir sur beaucoup de choses. Le seul rappeur à avoir toujours dit ce qu'il ne pouvait pas contenir dans son coeur..."
4,"voici sans doute un des albums les plus marquants de la discographie d'Eddy, d'une qualité rare, bref, un must. La richesse des arrangements et la prestation des musiciens accompagnent à merveille reprises et oeuvres originales - la différence est difficile à faire tant le résultat est éblouissant. Un vrai album de rock'n'roll comme on aimerait en entendre plus souvent, enfin remasterisé (même si l'intérieur du 33 tours original mérite le coup d'oeil...)"
4,merci amazon pour le super prix qui m'a permi d'acquérir ce classique du 20ème qui n'a pas veilli !
2,"Patrick Fiori, c'est une voix extraordinaire. Bien sûr il y a de grosses ficelles au niveau de l'émotion et quelques effets sont un peu ""fabriqués"". Tout cela se pardonne vite parce que le timbre est vraiment interessant et son énorme puissance vocale très bien maitrisée (y'a du travail chez ce type et c'est assez rare pour le signaler).Seulement voila, Patrick c'est un album peu connu et pas reconnu par les critiques : Chrysalide. Un vrai bijou, écrit par les frères Calogéro en partie et qui contient de vraies bonnes et belles chansons. De plus le son était bien au desus de la moyenne des productions française l'année de sa sortie. Pour en revenir à cet album, même constat que pour le précédent : ratage. Texte, niveau CM2, musique à la limite du ridicule, production ""avec le PC d'un pote..."" On ne retiendra que le Goldmanesque 4 mots sur un piano, parce-que c'est le seul moment où l'on retrouve la voix unique de ce chanteur qui se cherche."

5,"Si la mélodie n'est pas sans rappeler ""Elle ne me voit pas"" de la BO d'Astérix, les paroles sont encore une merveille poétique. JJG est bien le seul artiste a vous faire si souvent monter les larmes aux yeux... Mais à quand un nouvel album ????"
5,"CHIMENE BADI est excellente ! Elle nous donne les frissons dès qu'elle donne vie à une note ! Elle ne copie pas les chanteuses à voix (ce qui est le cas en ce moment), elle est absolument radieuse dans ce qu'elle chante, ses interprétations, ses sentiments... Rien à dire, c'est une pure merveille..."
2,"Chimène Badi a une belle voix, c'est indéniable...de toutes façons, elle pouvait difficilement faire pire que les Whatfor, même en se forçant! Mais je le concède, sa voix est très jolie...néanmoins je ne mets pas plus de 2 étoiles car les textes et les musiques manquent de profondeur, et puis surtout l'interprétation laisse à désirer: encore une chanteuse ""à voix"", qui chante comme les autres, finalement! A quand des chanteuses à tripes???"
1,"Cette album je le définit en 1 mot ""mauvais""mais alors vraiment mauvais.Les textes n'on pas evoluer car entre Au soleil et Le souvenir de ce jour vous voyer un changement?Cette album est impossible d'écouter en entier!Voix remixée,et remodelée!moi j'aime pas du tout mais peut-etre que vous Oui mais moi NON!"
4,"Cher Yannick, Merci à toi , tes musiciens et toute l'équipe pour ce fabuleux moment que tu nous offres à travers ta musique et les textes, après avoir vibrés avec toi sur les cours de tennis. Quelle bouffée de joie venue du plus profond de toi, de tes racines africaines, imprégnées de ta vie en France, de tes exploits tennistiques, de ta vie de famille, ... Comme chacun de nous, tu es un pélerin de passage sur cette terre, tu es unique. En écoutant les textes, en lisant à travers les lignes, tu sembles avoir vécu une expérience forte et vraie, frôlant la Lumière qui nous donne cette Force d'aimer. Merci de nous l'avoir partager. Cette après-midi au retour de l'école, nous avons dansé avec nos enfants sur quelques-unes de tes chansons.A travers le reportage à la télé de ton concert au cirque royal (Bruxelles - Belgique)- il y a un bon moment déjà-, il est évident que ce fut un moment ""magique"" de communion entre vous (les artistes) et le public se terminant dans les rues avoisiantes !! J'espère la prochaine fois y participer aussi. En attendant, il y a ton nouveau Live.  Merci pour tout ce que tu nous donnes et continueras à nous donner (vivement ton prochain CD), pour nous aider à retrouver ce regard vrai et positif sur les autres, sur le monde à travers cette vraie joie d'Afrique (malgré tout ...). Bonne route sur le chemin de la vie entourés de l'amour des tiens. Merci de rayonner cette flamme de feu qui es en toi et qui nous réchauffe le coeur lors de nos ""hivers intérieurs"". Aksanti Sana ! (= Merci beaucoup en Swaeli - RDC)."
5,"Tout simplement superbe ce double album. La Les Paul de Paul Personne se lâche, crie, rugie sans arrêts! Grande version du bourdon avec une Wah Wah à couper le souffle; De plus la prise de son est réussie. Paul Personne est tout simplement sublime. Dommage que la télé Française l'oublie beaucoup. Il mériterait bien d'y figurer. Il remonterait à coup sûr la qualité de ce qu'on nous infuse à longueur d'année."
1,Il ne s'agit pas de l'édition limitée avec livret de 94 pages [...]
5,"J'ai eu la chance d'assister à ce concert du TURNING POINT à l'Olympia, ce fut fabuleux, habitué à une  formation blues-rock comme sur ses albums précédents BARES WIRES et surtout BLUES FROM LAUREL CANYON , John Mayall nous surprend et nous envoûte avec des morceaux d'anthologie comme CALIFORNIA Ou encore I'M GONNA FIGHT FOR YOU JB, entouré de musiciens exceptionnels, John MARK à la guitare accoustique,assis par terre pendant tout le concert, ALMOND à la flûte, et Steve THOMSON à la basse seul rescapé de son précédent album, et bien sûr John Mayall guitare et harmonica ;pas de percussions si ce n'est le rythme produit par chaque instrument. Admirez le jeu de basse de ce dernier dans CALIFORNIA !! Un album à ne pas manquer.Manque une vidéo de ce concert exceptionnel"
5,"Bien sûr cet album n'est pas aussi sublime que les ""shake money maker"" ""the southern harmony"" ou ""amorica"" mais il renferme tout de même quelques pépites.Ceci dit les black crowes est un excellent groupe avec à sa tête deux frangins, Chris chanteur au gosier d'airain, Rich guitariste qui a tout compris des riffs de Keith Richards, et une section rythmique béton. Ce n'est pas pour rien que les anglo-saxon surnomme les Black crowes:"" Le groupe de rock le plus rock'n roll ""."
1,"Que dire après autant de commentaires élogieux sur cet album de Kiss, bien sur je l'ai acheté, à l'époque sur la pochette de l'édition française il y avait un autre logo pour Kiss à cause des 2 SS qui ressemblaient trop au symbole des nazis et j'ai beaucoup apprécié ce concert enregistré au Madison Square Garden, jusqu'au jour où j'ai appris qu'en fait Kiss n'avait gardé que les cris du public et que toute la musique avait été entièrement ré-enregistrée en studio à l'exception de la batterie, c'est un peu juste pour qualifier un CD de live dans ces conditions.  Dernière précision les précurseurs du hard rock sont Black Sabbath, Deep Purple et Led Zeppelin et le hard rock est apparu début des 70's en Angleterre (la terminologie en tout cas car des groupes US comme Gun, JPT Scare Band, Litter ou Blue Cheers en faisait déjà dés 1968) PS : Le magazine Musiq dans son édition N° 18 de Janvier-Février 2009 a consacré un dossier spécial Hard Rock de 40 pages avec 180 CD chroniqué, je cite pour le live de Kiss "" On sait désormais que tout ou presque a été rejoué en studio, mais franchement, qu'est ce que ça peut bien faire ?"" c'est vrai car ce sont de bons musiciens en live (voir le DVD Kissology N° 1), mais ça confirme bien ce qui est dit plus haut"
4,"J'ai toujours trouvé ""Fragile"" et ""Yes Album"" trop sages : les 2 disques contiennent des morceaux en devenir, qui prennent toute leur dimension dans ce live. Derrière la complexité de leur musique, on oublie souvent que Yes est aussi - surtout - un groupe de scène qui déploie ici une énergie incroyable. On pourra regretter les passages solo où le groupe s'efface pour permettre à chaque membre de faire son ""numéro"" (ce qui nous vaut une démonstration néo-classicisante de Wakeman en sorcier du moog, mais aussi la monstrueuse partie de basse de Squire sur ""The Fish""). Yes interprète l'intégrale de Close to the Edge, mais ce sont surtout des titres un peu plus anciens comme ""Roundabout"" ou ""Perpetual Change"" qui justifient l'écoute de ce disque. La proximité entre les musiciens est évidente. Un grand live pour un immense groupe. Pour le néophyte, Yessongs constitue une porte d'entrée accessible vers la musique de Yes, avant d'oser escalader des sommets tels que Relayer."
5,"Si le morceau qui éblouit immédiatement est le hendrixien furieux ""see the light"", tout dans cet album est splendide. Les morceaux oscillent entre rocks enlevés, blues bien sentis (la reprise de zz top, et son humour pince sans rire -blue jean blues- !!) et ballades (le bouleversant angel eyes, ou plus tempéré ""that's what they say""). Et au milieu, deux instrumentaux, l'un plus lent, l'autre rapide, qui se complètent parfaitement. Sans oublier ""river of no return"" et son solo magnifique.  Outre le son reconnaissable entre mille de sa strato, Jeff Healey possède une belle voix pure et légèrement cassée à la fois, qui fait mouche dans tous les registres. Avec sa technique ""sur les genoux"", Healey trouve des tirés incroyables et un vibrato unique. Chaque note vit à 200 %. Contrairement aux albums suivants, ""see the light"" à chaque écoute, se révèle tout autant magique, et suffit à offrir à ce musicien canadien une place incontestable au panthéon du rock."
5,"Avec ce magnifique disque, Roine Stolt va mettre sur pieds un des plus grands groupes actuels : The Flower Kings. Le Roi est seul pour l'instant et met tout en place : musique riche dans laquelle les amateurs de Yes,King Crimson, Genesis,Frank Zappa et bien d'autres devraient trouver leur bonheur, textes importants qui sont autant de réflexions sur les rapports entre êtres,l'ouverture de soi, les problèmes de société, les rapports avec l'histoire, la nature... A écouter avec le livret sous les yeux pour ne manquer aucun des mots du Roi Stolt. Et à lire sur www.prog-mania.com, l'interview du grand Suédois!"
4,"Les Hives font à peu de choses près le même album depuis un petit bout de temps maintenant. Raisonablement, on aurait tort de s'en priver puisqu'ils recèlent tous leur lot de petites pépites , et surtout la petite griffe implacable des Hives, le chant acharné d' ""Howlin Pelle"" , les riffs Stoogiens chers à la scène Finlandaise, ainsi que cette classe Rock'n Roll que peu de groupes auront su donner au Punk avec autant de succès. Remettons maintenant les choses à leur place : les Hives ne sont pas les sauveurs du rock. Juste un bon petit groupe, somme toute assez limité musicalement, mais toujours assez malin pour s'en tirer avec les honneurs grâce à quelques singles bien placés (""The Idiot Walk""). Tyranausorus Hives n'est donc certainement pas le chef d'oeuvre de l' année, mais il fera sans passer un excellent moment à tous les fans de Garage Roll. On aurait tort de ne pas en profiter."
1,"L'album du changement pour Dream Theater. Le groupe sort son concept album (passage obligé pour tout groupe de progressif qui se respecte), et je vais me faire incendier en disant que je le trouve long et ennuyeux. Certe, la production est parfaite et les musiciens sont égaux à eux-mêmes (c'est à dire, sûrement les meilleurs au monde), mais ou se trouve la combinaison magique des précédents albums qui alliée à la perfection Heavy Metal, mélodie et dextérité technique ? Beaucoup moins Heavy, la musique du groupe s'enlise. les mélodies très travaillées sont mielleuses et les passages techniques sont purement démonstratifs. On se dit que beaucoup de concept album ont cette impression de lassitude et de longueur, mais les futurs productions du groupe confirmeront cette tendance. Quelques passages sauvent ""Scenes from a memory"" de la catastrophe, comme sur ""Home"" et ""The dance of eternity"" (un sous ""Metropolis - Part I""), mais pour une personne qui place ""Images &amp; words"" et ""Awake"" sur un piédestale, cette album lui sera très difficile à apprécier. Néanmoins encensé par la critique, la musique du groupe va ramener de nombreux fans... et beaucoup d'autres iront voir ailleurs (souvent des fans de la première heure). D'ailleurs, à voir les réactions que provoquent ""Scenes from a memory"", je penses qu'il n'y a pas de juste milieu : soit on le déteste, soit on le vénère."
2,"Bof, vraiment trés Bof ..... Un album a mon goût trés plat, trés calme : TROP calme .... Trés peu de diversité dans les morceaux, un opus plus orienté ""world music"" et pop que reggae, ragga &amp; funk comme sur les anciens albums ... Trés peu de cuivres dans les instrumentaux, beaucoup de ballades un peu mievres...(Franchement pas + de 3 ou 4 morceaux ""interressants"") Il me semble d'ailleurs que ses musiciens ont changé et que ce n'est plus l'excellent ""Shashamani Band"" qui l'accompagne ... Patrice suit désormais sa route en solo et l'orientation musicale qu'il a choisi ne me plait pas vraiment .... Mais bon chacun ses goûts comme on dit ... Bref, vraiment pas emballé du tout par ce dernier album ..."
5,"Vraiment, c'est un très bon album, on ne peut pas juger comme ça, sans vraiment connaître les arrières pensées. Gwen a vécu une passe dificile, ce qui lui a donné de l'inspiration. Il y a vraiment de merveilleuses chansons dans cet album. On ne peut rien ressentir en l'écoutant."
5,"Après la déception Get behind me Satan (2005) et l'agréable mais anecdotique échappée vers The Raconteurs (2006), Jack et Meg se sont retrouvés à Nasville, TN pour un retour aux sources. Et que dire, sinon qu'après une première face poussive, on ne quitte plus les sommets. Revue d'effectif: 1-Icky Thump : consacré aux drames de l'immigration, ce premier titre sonne comme un inédit, voire un pur plagiat, de Led Zeppelin. Son lourd et plombé, ponts très 70es : loin d'Immigrant song, on pense plutôt aux pénibles albums d'après Physical Graffiti. 2-You don't know what love is (you just do as you're told) : ballade rugueuse façon Deep South. Une belle simplicité, qui rappellera le Creedence Clearwater Revival aux plus âgés. 3-300 M.P.H. Torrential Outpour Blues : une autre ballade, plus apaisée et très typique du groupe. Aurait pu figurer sur White blood cells. 4-Conquest : premier sommet de l'album avec cette irrésistible espagnolade et ses trompettes de pacotille. 5-Bone Broke : deuxième plagiat de Led Zeppelin. Un bon titre, qui ne déchaînera pas les foules. 6-Prickly Thorn, But Sweetly Worn : troisième plagiat de Led Zeppelin, mais cette fois-ci versant gaélique (The battle of evermore et ce genre de choses). Personnellement, ça m'ennuie. 7-St. Andrew (This Battle Is In The Air) : Interlude et variation sur le thème précédent. On commencerait presque à s'ennuyer mais les choses sérieuses commencent... 8-Little cream soda : c'est un peu le Seven Nation Army de l'album. Classique instantané. 9-Rag and bone : un blues joué très vite et très fort. AC/DC en rêvait, les White Stripes l'ont fait. Un autre classique instantané qui rendra Angus Young jaloux (et j'adore Angus). 10-I'm slowly turning into you. Un autre excellent titre ! Après une introduction un rien poussive, le motif qui se dégage est parmi les meilleurs écrits par Jack. Une grande chanson perverse. 11-A martyr for my love for you. Une belle ampleur pour cette ballade remarquable. L'orgue discret et efficace, la guitare acoustique et le très beau texte feraient presque penser à Nick Cave période Let love in. 12-Catch hell blues. C'est pour moi le sommet de l'album et plus généralement la quintessence de l'art des White Stripes. Deux accords à la slide guitar, une montée progressive de la tension, la batterie furieuse de Meg qui surgit, un pont inattendu, des ruptures, des échappées, puis à nouveau la grosse guitare et la caisse claire avant de conclure sur la slide. Royal. 13-Effect and cause. Ballade redneck façon Stones période Beggars Banquet. Si les 33 t existaient toujours, les deux faces du disque ne connaîtraient pas la même usure. Achat indispensable : à leur top, Meg et Jack n'ont pas de concurrents dans le délicat exercice d'archivistes et refondateurs du blues rock."
5,"Album frais et juvénile à écouter en ballade dans les vignes, en descendant le chemin bordée d'une muret de pierres sèches, le tout baigné d'une douce lumière de printemps. Chansons turgescentes à l'image des bourgeons débordant de vie et d'énergie. Ah, c'est beau le printemps musical ;-)"
5,"Bien sur il y eut le célèbre Enola Gay qui tourna en boucle sur de nombreuses platines avant l'invention du CD, mais il y eut aussi un groupe phare de la new wave qui savait distiller des superbes mélodies avec une grande richesse de sons tirés de leurs synthés (analogiques à l'époque !) et la belle voix grave du chanteur J'ai aussi le souvenir d'un excellent concert dans lequel tous ces morceaux furent joués (ça devait être en 81 ou 82... ouahh quelle claque !!) Il y a probablement un petit air de nostalgie dans ce CD, mais surement beaucoup de plaisir"
5,"Un album tout simplement magique. Un quelquechose de fantastique. Je l'ai écouté des heures durant il y a quelques années. J'y ai associé certains passages de ma vie. J'attends avec impatience de le recevoir. Ne serait-ce pas là un brin de nostalgie ? Essayez donc ""Lenny Valentino"". Un thème envoutant et entrainant. Les souvenirs se bousculent dans ma tête. Je suis persuadé qu'à l'écoute de ""New French Girlfriend"", vous revivrez sans doute aucun, vos premiers flirts. Et, je ne vous parle pas des autres chansons.  A consommer avec modération sous peine de ne plus vouloir revenir à aujourd'hui"
2,"La presse annonçait le retour de Dave avec un album sophistiqué de reprises des années 50 et 60. Il est vrai que le produit est bien réalisé et le voyage en arrière réussi. Patrick Loiseau s'est attelé à l'adaptation française des tubes de The Fleetwoods (Doux tam-tam), Roy Orbison (Un signe de vie de vous) ou Petula Clark (Vieillir avec toi).  La belle endormie est l'occasion d'un duo avec Marie-France, égérie travesti du Palace des années 80 (qui a déjà prêté sa voix au tube de Prince, Girls &amp; Boys). Sur Ne t'embarrasse pas de remords (à l'origine un tube de Buddy Holly écrit par Paul Anka) c'est le très champêtre Kent qui accompagne un Dave transformé en juke-box à souvenirs. Avec sa compatriote du pays des tulipes et de l'Édam, Keren Ann, il interprète le seul titre d'origine francophone : Je t'appartiens de Gilbert Bécaud anglicisé en Let it be me par les Everly Brothers en 1960. Notons également les deux titres Blue Velvet et So much in love qui, suite au refus de l'éditeur américain d'adapter le texte, se trouvent chanter dans la langue de Shakespeare. Voilà, nous avons fait le tour d'un album qui aurait certainement mérité des louanges si le résultat n'était pas aussi ennuyeux passé les deux, trois premiers titres. Alors, sophistiqué ou soporifique ?"
4,"C'est de la vraie musique de rock/ folk/rock jusqu'au moment où tout dérape, et cela devient autre chose. Mais cela reste pas mal du tout. Roky Erickson, le chanteur, y va de sa chanson comme un McGuinn qui se respecte et puis, tout d'un coup, on entre dans des hurlements lysergiques qui laissent penser que les martiens ont débarqué dans le studio. Mais heureuseument que Tommy Hall, le meilleur joueur de cruche éléctrique du monde ( le seul, probablemnt) nous gratifie de plus de normalité!!!!! Les elevators sont probablement les précurseurs du psychédilisme qui, par leur style, ont lancé un mouvement et une mode qui traversera les ages. Un vraiment bon disque."
5,Que des tubes. Très bonne interprétation. Le son est parfait. Ces titres n'ont pas pris une ride et font toujours rêver.
1,"Quand on connaît et reconnaît l'immense talent de compositeur de Laurent Voulzy, son incroyable acuité mélodique, on peut regretter qu'il se laisse aller à nous offrir un disque d'ambiance et composé uniquement de reprises, aussi bien choisies soient-elles ! C'est censé être la bande-son de nos vacances à la mer? Dommage je préfère rester en ville et éventuellement écouter les originaux."
1,"Si vous voulez savoir comment dénaturer les plus belles chansons de Mylène Farmer, je vous conseille vivement cette album ""Remixes"" des plus inintéressant. A part l'excellent X-Key Remix de ""L'instant X"" de One-T et à la limite le remix de ""Pourvu qu'elle soit douce"", tous les autres morceaux vous prennent la tête des les premières secondes et on a qu'une seule envie, passer à la prochaine en éspérant qu'elle soit meilleure (ce qui n'arrive que rarement). Alors si vous aimez Mylène Farmer et la techno bien hard, achetez sans crainte, sinon passez votre chemin !"
2,"Désolé d'être rabat-joie, mais il manque ""Le Sud"" et ""la maison près de la fontaine"" qui sont peut être à part mais certainement parmi les... 2 meilleures de Nino Ferrer. Heureusement, des best of Nino, il y a en a d'autres (et des meilleurs)"
2,"Je suis étonné que cette édition soit encore disponible : c'est celle qui a sévi pendant dix ans quand l'éditeur a resorti en cd l'intégrale de brel en se contentant de faire un transfert analogique digital. Le son n'est vraiment pas bon : il est gris, étriqué, sans ampleur, ni profondeur, ni dynamique. La voix de Brel flotte au-desus d'un orchestre plat et sans relief. Les bons vieux vinyles sonnaient cent fois mieux. De plus, ce n'est même pas la pochette originale. Mais heureusement, l'album a été depuis remasterisé, et remarquablement. La nouvelle édition nous restitue enfin dans tout son éclat ce chef d'oeuvre de Brel. Privilégiez-donc l'édition ""l'original"" avec la magnifique pochette d'époque. Elle existe en Cd normal, ou, mieux, en édition SACD avec un mix 5.1. Même si vous n'êtes pas équipé SACD 5.1, je vous conseille l'édition SACD un petit peu plus chère mais, si vous faites évoluer votre installation, cela vous évitera de racheter ce disque. Comme l'édition SACD est hybride, elle est peut être lue sans problème sur n'importe quel lecteur CD (mais pas sur certains lecteurs DVD, donc prudence si vous utilisez un lecteur DVD pour lire vos CD)."
5,"Ruthme et paroles aussi agréables qu'est l'Amérique du Sud. Soleil, salsa... tout pour etre en forme."
1,"Tous s'y sont mis pour nous annoncer la bonne nouvelle. Les Inrocks, bien sûr, mais ça on s'y attendait, Télérama, voulant rester dans le coup mais aussi Rock'n Folk, France Inter, Libé, Télé Loisirs, Rustica, Pif Gadget ou même les blagues de Carambar. Tous vous l'ont dit : vous ne passerez pas l'été sans succomber au charme révolutionnaire et salvateur de JUSTICE, le nouveau duo électro qui réinvente Daft Punk dix ans après Homework. Sur le papier, l'affaire est alléchante. Gaspard Augé et Xavier de Rosnay sont bien habillés, enfin bien lookés. D'un look qui n'appartient qu'aux musiciens de la Hype, c'est à dire une pilosité et des fringues qui, rendraient n'importe quel quidam absolument ridicule mais qui, sur eux, font ""hype"". Ces deux énergumènes ayant, voilà plus d'un an, remixé le titre d'un assez obscur groupe anglais (Simian) pour en faire un tube dans les soirées parisiennes, puis sur MTV enfin dans tous les Macumba Clubs du monde, ont donc droit au titre de sauveurs de l'électro. A l'oreille, l'affaire est beaucoup plus délicate. Le single "" DANCE"", improbable bidouillage d'un chant pour colonies de vacances et de rythmiques compressées, sorti juste avant l'été était le signe avant coureur d'un ALBUM ENCORE PLUS CATASTROPHIQUE QUE TOUT CE QU'ON POUVAIT RAISONNABLEMENT PENSER. Que les critiques y soient quasiment tous allés dans leur chronique du petit couplet genre ""il y aura toujours des grincheux pour dire que Justice, qui sort de nulle part, est un gros coup médiatique alors que ce sont des garçons adorables"" aurait évidemment dû nous mettre la puce à l'oreille. Alors que personne à part eux, petits veinards de chroniqueurs, n'avait entendu cet album, on criait déjà à la caballe anti-Justice et on jetait le discrédit sur d'éventuels détracteurs. L'album , -rien que le titre est un concept, man !- déballe donc 12 titres d'une électro assez poussive, dominée par des rythmiques bourrées de contretemps et de breaks épuisants qui asservissent la plupart des séquences musicales. Il en résulte un manque cruel de mélodies et une linéarité factuelle qui fatigue rapidement. En fait de bande son de l'été, on se retrouve finalement avec une compilation de jingles qui serviront probablement de support aux bandes annonces de TF1 pour l'été...2008."
5,"RENAUD et NON le Renard, une lettre peut tout changé, mais Renaud, lui n'a pas changé, il est resté le même, un peu vieilli certes, mais y ' a toujours dans l'écriture de ces textes, toujours de la volonté, de la révolution envers cette société et ses dirigeants politiques ou médiatiques. Je pense que c'est l'un , voir le meilleur album de sa carrière. Un album à écouter, en boucle, Renaud est comme le beaujolais, toujours Nouveau. Le nouveau Renaud est arrivé, et pour longtemps."
2,"De la part d'un groupe tel que Muse, on se permet d'avoir certaines attentes. En ce qui me concerne, je m'attendais à un album différent certes, mais dans la lignée de qualité des précédents.  Cet album n'est pas mauvais, mais tellement loin de ce qu'ils nous ont habitué d'entendre. Il y a bien sûr quelques bons morceaux ; mais sur les précédents albums, tout était bon, et c'est là la grande différence de ce dernier opus. Muse, si vous me lisez, ne vous reposez pas sur vos beaux lauriers..."
5,"« Bluesyssime », original ou devrais-je dire Authentique, la voix caverneuse pénétrante et obscure, cigarettes et alcools au fond d’un bar, piano légèrement désaccordé mais piano tout de même, cet homme et sa musique, sont un film, une poésie baudelairienne … Les extraits musicaux disponibles devraient finir par vous convaincre que si il y a un Cd de Waits que vous devez possédez, c’est probablement celui-ci. Un « Blue Valentines »… que nous avons tous vécu."
5,"Je suis americaine, excusez-moi si ma francais n'est pas bien.  J'ai vu qu'il n'y a aucune de commentaire sur cette CD.  Si vous aimez tendre musique, achetez cette CD! Vous saviez Elliott Smith de ""Will Hunting."" Si vous l'aimez, achetez cette CD vite!"
5,"Comment mélanger dans un même album, avec art et surtout harmonie du rock, du Chopin, du Rachmaninov et de l'opéra de Camille Saint Saens ?  Ecoutez cet album et vous aurez la réponse. Muse utilise à merveille ces ruptures de rythme et ces changements d'univers comme l'avait si bien fait avant lui Queen.  J'ai été particulièrement bluffée par l'intégration de son nocturne de Chopin et de la chanson de Dalila à laquelle, avec une voix de chanteur dit ""rock"", Muse parvient à apporter une dimension lyrique étonnante et ""qui donne les poils"", même si sa prononciation est aussi charmante qu'approximative. Je salue la culture musicale de ce groupe. Merci Muse de nous prouver que les rockeurs ne sont pas des neuneus qui hurlent en grattant des guitares saturés. Si si, les rockeurs ont de la sensibilité, une oreille musicale et même une formation classique pour certains (comme c'est le cas de Muse).  Alors, on fait quoi ? On l'écoute ou pas ?  Evidemment !! Et pour ceux qui veulent approfondir leur culture musicale, je recommande Rachmaninov interprété par Evgeni Kissin, et forcemment Maria Callas pour Samson et Dalila."
1,"Où est la différence entre ce disque et un disque de Louise Attaque ? En fait, comme Louise Attaque n’a eu qu’une chanson, ce n’est peut être pas étonnant qu’ils aient fait exactement la même chanson encore... 14 fois !Ahhhhhhhhhhh... il faut les arrêter !"
5,"Le nouvel opus de Muse ravira ceux qui ont pris le train en marche (à partir de Black Holes and Revelations dans mon cas)... et inquiétera - à juste titre - plus d'un puriste ! Certes, le groupe reste égal à lui-même sur quelques excellents titres (comme ""Uprising"") et s'aventure vers d'autres galaxies musicales (le baroque ""United States of Eurasia"", très inspiré par Queen et ""1984"" de G. Orwell, ou encore ""I Belong To You/Mon coeur s'ouvre à toi""), sans toujours convaincre (""Resistance"" est correct, sans plus ; quant à ""Undisclosed Desires"", on croirait cette pièce electro-pop sortie d'un disque de Depeche Mode). On laissera volontiers de côté le très dispensable ""Guiding Light"", indigne de figurer sur un album de Muse. Le disque s'achève sur une symphonie en trois actes, ""Exogenesis"", morceau potentiellement intéressant, mais on reste un peu sur sa faim."
5,"Si vous aimez les white stripes, si vous aimez les stooges, si vous aimez kate bush dans ses délire vocaux, si vous êtes à la recherche de la sensation 2003, ce disque est pour vous ! Ce n'est pas seulement une ressucée d'un punk rock new-yorkais largement revisité de nos jours, ce disque est une véritable bombe. A écouter d'urgence !!!!"
5,"Depuis quelques années je tends une oreille attentive vers ce groupe suédois dont quelques disques ont été produits par Steve Wilson lequel les encense régulièrement dans ses interviews. Donc une caution et une histoire de 18 ans et 9 albums qui peuvent suggérer que ce groupe doit avoir des choses à dire. Cependant les diverses écoutes que j'ai pu avoir de leurs précédents albums m'ont pas vraiment poussé à les acheter, le chant ""death"" omniprésent n'est pas vraiment ma tasse de thé. Ce dernier opus, encensé par la critique (DRPP, Progressive Waves, Progressia.net) et la lecture d'une interview dans Xroads de Mikael Akerfeldt fondateur, auteur-compositeur, chanteur, guitariste, bref leader du groupe où il dit que ""je ne nous considère définitivement plus comme un groupe de pur death-metal"", m'ont poussé au geste intrépide de m'offrir cet album ! Et bien je peux dire que ces critiques positives sont tout à fait justifiées ! Il n'est pas question pour un groupe déja ancien de dire 'ça ressemble à..."", chacun pourra y trouver certaines références. Si le métal est bien sûr omniprésent c'est bien l'esprit prog qui traverse les 7 morceaux de ce disque. Les claviers, pourtant réduits à du piano, de l'Hammond du farfisa et surtout du mellotron (et quel mellotron: je ne crois pas avoir entendu ce son depuis ""In the court of...."") et les parties de guitares acoustiques tempèrent les moments de rage qui ont fait le son du groupe. Ceci dit même le son des guitares évoque le plus souvent King Crimson (style Red ou Level 5..) que Dream Theater. Peu de shredding malgré la haute qualité de performance des 2 guitaristes (""Burden"", malgré la seule faute de goût dans ce disque, la guitare qui se désaccorde volontairement à la fin du morceau). D'ailleurs les 5 musiciens sont d'une virtuosité prodigieuse, pas étonnant à ce niveau...La voix fe Mikael Akerfield est simplement superbe (je pense au regretté David Byron de Uriah Heep) et le chant death très bien intégré, à la manière du rap ou des dialogues dans Pain Of Salvation ou des samples dans Pendragon. Au total, 5 minutes de ce chant concentré pratiquement sur la seconde plage sur une durée de 1 heure, ce qui lève ma rhédibition!! C'est cependant un disque de contraste dans lequel il n'est pas évident d'entrer, et plusieurs écoutes permettent d'en découvrir les subtilités, même si l'impact de la première écoute donne une impression de réussite et d'homogénéité du discours. Avec des moments très forts (""""The lotus Eater) et des mélodies simplement prodigieuses ( ""Hessian Peel"", le meilleur morceau). Une ambiance mélancolique, voire sombre (mais pas gothique style gros riffs de guitares sur fond d'orgue), des riffs sortis de l'enfer, des arpèges de guitare et de piano dignes de Génésis... bref un disque plus qu'intéressant même hautement recommandable qui donne en tout cas envie de suivre de près les prochaines productions de ce groupe. Décidément, la Suède, premier pays du prog !!!"
2,"Le chien se mord la queue,les mêmes plans qui renvoient aux albums précédents,dispensable...."
5,"Quoi? oui, c est une référence.  Jamais vu des artistes avec un talent aussi prononcé en musique. Rien que la basse? sur le cd, ca s entend, c est un géant de la basse...mais sur le dvd, c est classé grand art indétronable:vitesse, précision, rythme, et mélodie sur une technique irréprochable, voilà qui califie le jeu de basse dans Mudvayne...Et le reste? Une voix différente, un timbre gras et mélodieux a la fois, une vision de la musique et un sens des paroles qui font rêver, un jeu de guitare sans fioritures ni déchets et un batteur excellent derrière son drum set.  Sans oublier un jeu de scène des plus étrange et endiablé qui soit. Bref une référence..."
1,"Si vous vous reconnaissez dans la masse des ados crées pour la société de conssomation, alors cet album est pour vous, baggy, skate, american pie 2, alors foncez l'achetez et je direz meme immédiatement, entre deux big macs. Pour les autres, constater par vous meme, musique inexistante(trois accords, et de la gratte sans inspirtion), absolument aucun message et un chanteur qui ne sait que gueuler éspérant attirer plus de clients, en fin de compte un album dans la droite ligne de la musique d'aujourd'hui, inexistante. Un avis qui m'ai personnelle mais qui est aussi un message d'avertissement, dans cinq ans a ce rythme la il n'y aura plus rien. Et aussi quand nos virtuoses se permettent de pariodier des grands comme ""iron Maiden""(pain for pleasure) alors qu'ils ne sont pas capables de reproduire un tiers de la mélodie originale, on n'a plus qu'a aller se planquer et attendre l'accalmie. A bon entendeur salut."
1,"Oui Metallica se remet en question d'un album à l'autre. Oui Metallica est un groupe culte. Oui Metallica n'a besoin de personne pour faure de la musique...et bien pourtant cet album est une pure horreur, tant au niveau du son, que des mélodies, que des paroles...Cet album n'a de place dans une discothèque qu'en tant que premier album d'un groupe, pas en tant qu'album lié à son renouveau, à moins que Metallica ai choisit de se tourner vers du Nu-Metal bien commercial...c'est bien dommage..."
5,"C'est album n'est pas à décrire.Il se vit!!!J'ai grandi avec blink et je suis toujours le meme gosse acharné et tant mieux.Cet album est plus que de la simple musique meme bonne.Je pense que jamais il ne sera égalé.Il y a des idées, du talent, un humour propre au groupe et a toute la communauté qu'il a créer.Cet album a changé bien des vies c'est une énorme claque à la morosité que l'on entend si souvent.Je suis fière de cet album achetez le et si il ne vous plait pas laisser le de coté le temps que votre oreille musicale se forme, elle vous en remerciera tout simplement la meilleure musique de ces trentes dernieres années et je pèse mes mots!!!"
5,"Box Car Racer est fomé par 2 ex de blink mais leur musique n'est pas la méme, un album indispensable pour tous ce qui écoute du métal! Avc des morceaux de guitare solo qui déchire on ne peut que se déchéné a l'écoute! Avec en prime un morceau instrumentale, un vrai petit bijoux! Je le recommende a tous pris!"
5,ce disque est une révélation pour ce genre de musique ce disque cartonne et il est vraiment extraordinaire un conseil si vous n'avez pas ce disque DOES THIS LOOK INFECTED acheter le vite sur amazon .Toutes les chansons cartonnent de 1 à la 12 aucune moins bien que les autres.C'est cool pas vrai. GAVIN
5,"Elle est jolie et elle chante bien. Elle fait tout elle-même (musique, paroles...) et elle le fait bien."
2,"comment écrire un critique négative sur un album solo d'eddie vedder quand on est fan (depuis plus de 10 ans...) de pearl jam et de son chanteur emblématique? pour faire court, j'ai eu l'impression d'écouter un clone d'eddie... sorry ed ! la puissance, la force et la beauté de la voix sont bien au rendez-vous mais les lignes de chant et les compositions me semblent bien fades et sans charme. j'ai été très déçu, mais finalement cela me rend encore plus accroc à pearl jam qui reste un groupe entier ou chaque membre tiens ça place comme il se doit et sert l'ensemble avec inspiration et force!"
1,"Après leur précédent album qui renouvelait un peu le genre avec des sonorités pop et riches à la fois, EIST s'est enfermé dans un schéma très (trop) formaté. Ce disque ne se renouvèle pas, répète des thèmes facile et lasse dès la première écoute. Comme quoi un jour il faut savoir s'arrêter quand on est a court d'inspiration."
5,"Le meilleur du combo écossais, et un des tout meilleurs albums de l'année. Tout à son ""devoir de grisaille"" et à sa modestie, il n'avait jamais jusqu'alors livré un album aussi cohérent, aussi lumineux. Rien à jeter dans ce recueil de mini-symphonies pour guitares saturées, piano, basse, synthé et batterie (et voix, parfois), et quelques sommets où s'impose enfin une patte, un vrai son Mogwai, transcendant les nombreuses influences du groupe (de Glen Branca à My Bloody Valentine jusqu'à Sigur Ros, en passant par toute la nébuleuse noisy et notamment le trop sous-estimé et pourtant séminal Swervedriver - grande cause perdue des années 90). Les majestueux orages soniques (Glasgow Mega Snake, Travel Is Dangerous, We're No Here, le superbe Folk Death 95) alternent avec des titres plus apaisés (Acid Food, comme sorti d'un album de Air, Team Handed, Emergency Trap, I Chose Horses et sa voix parlée) et dessinent autant de vastes paysages mentaux, bande-son idéale de nos hivers intérieurs dont ils réchauffent les couleurs. Au sommet, le sublime ""Friend of the night"" et ses entêtantes cadences ternaires, déclinées sur trois simplissimes arpèges de guitare et piano croisés, dont l'ampleur mélancolique évoque une ""montée au calvaire"" à vous fendre l'âme en deux.  Michael Mann, le plus brillant sculpteur d'ambiances du cinéma américain, ne s'y est pas trompé, puisque deux titres de ""Mr Beast"" se retrouvent en bonne place sur la BoF du très réussi ""Miami Vice"". PS : l'album mérite de très nombreuses écoutes, car il se bonifie à chaque fois jusqu'à devenir indispensable."
1,"Le chanteur sans voix, sans charisme et sans talent récidive avec un nouvel opus. Que dire, sinon que l'ennui est une fois de plus au rendez-vous ? La chanson française se porte bien. Réjouissons-nous !"
1,"après l'album jubilatoire ""giant"", on attendait avec impatience ce nouvel opus!! Et là c'est la déception car on s'ennuie à mourir à écouter leurs chansons d'un autre age. On dirait de vieux soixante huitards attardés. Si certains voient de l'humour dans ce cd, pas moi. Même la pochette est moche alors que la précédente était plus recherchée même si ce n'était qu'une imitation du groupe comus des années 70."
1,"Une fois de plus je vais apporter ma voix discordante au concert des louangeurs..Toujours avide de decouvertes et voulant me tenir au fait de l'actu musicale branchée, j'ai essayé d'ecouter cet album auquel vous ,amis amazoniaques, tressez des couronnes. Ma couronne a moi sera emplie d'epines. En effet que dire de ce disque, sinon qu'il est a l'image de son epoque : insignifiant!Pourquoi chanter-si on peut appeller ca chanter- quand rien ne sort des tripes, quant on ecrit des textes creux,sur des musiques fades et pretentieuses ? Non , decidement je ne comprends pas comment cela peut toucher des auditeurs, l'attrait du vide peut-etre? Encore une fois la pensée unique Obispienne presente partout parmis les medias et les programmateurs a frappé faisant de ce Biolay un chanteur à la mode-  tres loin du genie d'un  Gainsbourg auquel je l'ai deja entendu comparer,mais plutot a sa place comme parrain de la star ac..(ce n'est pas un compliment :) )"
1,"Je trouve cet album franchement mauvais. On ne reconnait même plus les chansons d'Elton John, à par une ou deux. J'ai toujours écoutée les albums ""Star Academy"", mais celui là est le plus mauvais..."
5,Merci Angie Roberto et Olivier d'avoir laissé une chance aux garçons de Link up . Chaque voix amene un plus. Otis Mathieu et Lionel je vous souhaite une bonne et longue route
4,"Un album excellent, à écouter et réécouter! Un album plein de réalisme et de sincérité qui parle de tout et de rien..."
5,"On attendait tous cet album avec plus ou moins d'impatience, pour différentes raisons, de 1) pour la voix (exceptionnelle) de Mariah Carey. 2) Pour voir et surtout écouter comment Mariah a diriger son nouvel album après l'échec de GLITTER (qui pourtant est un bon album, car Mariah change de registre et ça lui va bien!!! dommage que le public n'ai pas suivi). 3) pour la collaboration de Mariah avec de grand noms du HipHop Us (Jay Z, Freeway, Cam'Ron, West Side Connection, Kelly Price et Joe) QUE DU BON SON!!!!! 4) Parceque Mariah carey sait se remettre en cause, donc elle sait prendre des directions musicales differentes et innover c'est ce qu'elle a fait pour Charmbracelet (Boy i need you, You got me...), il y a egalement des ballades signé d'une main de maitre (saving my grace, throught it..., yours...). Bref Charmbracelet marque une nouvelle étape dans la carrière de Mariah Carey, celle de la RENAISSANCE car soyez en sur CHARMBRACELET va re-PROPULSER Mariah dans les Charts!!! A se procurer de toute URGENCE!!!"
5,"Katie Mélua possède une voix exceptionnelle suave et sensuelle, qui est parfaitement mise en valeur par des musiques a fredonner toute la journée, un excellent CD et une merveilleuse chanteuse"
5,"Lors d'une émission de radio il y a environ 15 jours, j'ai entendu quelques accords d'une chanson portée par une voix sortie tout droit d'un autre monde. Aussitôt, j'ai tout fait pour trouver le nom de l'interprête, de l'album et pour me le procurer. Aujourd'hui, c'est chose faite et je viens d'écouter pour la première fois la merveile que je viens de recevoir. Un timbre de voix qui envahit tout le corps à en donner la chair de poule. Des mélodies rares interprétées tout en nuance et en émotion. Du haut de ses 20 ans Katie Melua est un talent à découvrir et à faire partager au plus vite."
2,"La petite Paradis a grandi, mais la voix est toujours aussi petite. Aucune présence sur scène... Où est l'artiste??? Pourtant en France Vanessa Paradis est devenue une chanteuse populaire. Je me demande sur quels critères ses fans se basent pour faire de cette dame une star de la chanson."
1,"Fille bien née (donc fille à papa), piochant dans tous les domaines artistiques, Bruni sans doute bien aidée s'est décidée d'aller se faire un peu d'argent dans le monde de la chanson. L'album s'est bien vendu, notamment, chez les Bobos. Tout le monde sait, les bobos ont un goût sûr. Moi, je suis pas un bobo ! Mes goûts sont peu certains mais sensible aux jolies voix, je m'éloigne des voies de garage."
1,Voila qu'on s'apercoit que la soi-disant poétesse n'était qu'une assoifée de pouvoir cherchant à se vendre au prince le plus haut placé....Sic transit gloria mundi. Son disque perd soudainement toute saveur et je le renvoie direct à l'Elysée :(
5,"Le dernier travail de Bernard Herrmann est aussi impressionant qu'un scenario de Paul Shrader et Martin scorcese. Le theme musicale de ""Taxi Driver"" est assez simple, mais dans cette simplicité  on entend tout le desespoir et la tristesse d'un homme seul qui est consideré par les autres comme un schisophrene. Un petit conseil-si vous n'avez pas vu le film,il faut absolument le voir d'abord,pour bien comprendre et savourer la musique."
2,On prend les mêmes et on recommence... Un peu comme Norah Jones il n'y a pas de différence entre le premier et le second album au niveau du son. C'est le même en beaucoup moins bien. Va falloir qu'elle évolue.
5,"Après leur disque de réunion (Twi Against Nature) un peu fourre-tout, voici le disque de renouveau. Pour la première fois, les Dan se présentent comme un groupe, constant et homogène: c'est les mêmes musiciens et le même son que l'on entend à travers tout le disque. Au niveau des textes, c'est l'unité: il s'agit presque d'un disque concept, parlant de la braderie finale d'une Amerique en déclin après le 11 septembre, l'éclatement de la bulle internet, et les scandales d'Enron et compagnie. Que ce soit un cadre au chomage qui met sur le même plan la perte de l'amour et la perte du job, et du comfort matériel qui en dépendait (Things I miss the most) d'un homme qui s'en va se noyer dans une ""piscine de Margaritas"" après la faillite de son entreprise (ou de son couple), ou l'appel, dans un centre commercial, à faire ses dernières courses avant l'apocalypse (The Last Mall),ce disque est bourré de mélancolie et d'ironie, pour ne pas dire d'un désespoir savamment habillé par une élégance suave. Ce disque est moins spéctaculaire que les précédents, mais il se bonifie après chaque écoute."
1,"Sans doute bon musicien manouche, il nous livre un disque ennuyeux. Imitant la voix de son père, il trouve l'originalité dans les arrangements jazz-manouche qui lassent rapidement si bien que ""Comme un manouche sans guitare"" (ça nous reposerait) devient ""Comme un Dutronc sans Dutronc""..."
5,"Incontestablement le meilleur album de Cabrel (un des plus grands chanteurs français contemporains), et un des plus grands disques de chanson française qui soient ! Parfait, ce disque, du long de ces 50 minutes (et autant de secondes), propose 10 immenses titres, pas un seul n'est moins bon que les 9 autres. Seul petit bémol : les 4 hits du disque sont tous placés au début de l'album. Pourquoi ne pas les avoir dispatchés plus largemen sur toute la galette ? Quand on l'écoute pour la première fois, on entend d'abord les hits que tout le monde connaît, puis, ensuite, 5 chansons (certes magnifiques) inconnues des radios.  Dispatcher les 4 hits tout du long du disque l'aurait rendu sans doute un peu plus intéressant. Mais comme j'adore ce disque dans sa totalité, ça ne me gêne que très légèrement !"
1,"Et oui il est dur, très dur d'écouter ce disque. Aujourd'hui n'importe qui peut enregistrer un disque si il a le bonheur(ça reste à prouver)de participer à une émission de télévision médiatique. Dès lors le résultat est désastreux et aurait pu être pire si les  prouesses technologiques ne venaient pas gommer les imperfections de la vois nasillarde de jennifer. En bref un disque à oublier ou réservé au 10-12 ans."
2,"un album vraiment moyen a part la chanson casse comme du verre,le reste est bien moyen voir mauvais,je suis decu..."
1,"Lorie vise large, cherchant aussi bien l'appui des petites filles dans ses bluettes, des pré-ado dans son look (et son niveau de réflexion....) et des ados mâles en tentant un racolage par des danses plus suggestives. Mais en fait elle n'incarne rien. Game over."
5,"Malgré tous ce que les autres disent sur cette album,moi je le trouvent magnifique,dynamique et amusant!Week-end est marrante et bouge bien,positive attitude bouge beaucoup,ensorcellé nous transporte dans les iles,sur la scéne bouge bien et a une bonne musique...A consommer sans moderation!!!"
2,"Assez décevant a mon gout,les paroles sont répétitives,les musiques se ressemblent entre elles,mais c'est un album dynamique,plein de bonne humeur. Pour moi Lorie vise un public trop jeune et cela est dommage car elle a du talent et une jolie voix. Elle devrait tout de même plus travailler ses albums avant de les sortirs."
1,"La musique de cet album est fade sans originalité, les paroles sont cuculapraline, la chanteuse lorie n'est pas trés mignonne et n'a pas l'air sympa, en bref, c'est un pur produit marketing destiné au fillette(et encore si vous voulait abrutir vos enfants)de cinq ans, je vous déconseille vivement d'acheter cet album qui a certaine similitude avec le premier album de miss spears."
5,"Dans ce best of ""au fur et à mesure"", nous pouvons apprécier la qualité artistique de Liane foly et redécouvrir ou découvrir selon les personnes le dynamisme ainsi que la sensibilité réelle de cette artiste à travers ces textes. Alors les fans ou anti-liane foly vous n'avez qu'à écouter par vous-même et vous jugerez le talent de cette dernière !"
5,"Je n'ai encore entendu que deux titres de cet album, ""Mon Paradis"" que j'aime beaucoup, mais surtout ""J'apprends"", ce morceau écrit par Jonatan et qui nous donne toute la dimension de ses talents d'auteur compositeur, mais également met en valeur toutes les facettes de sa voix magnifique. De la chaleur, de la puissance, de la douceur, tout y est. Merci Jonatan pour m'avoir donné tant de bonheur déjà et pour toutes ces heures merveilleuses à venir. Découvrir ton nouvel album sera comme ton beau titre, le paradis."
5,"Fan du groupe depuis la première heure, j'attendais le dernier album avec impatience. Et je n'ai pas été déçu. Sleeping with Ghosts est selon moi l'album référence du groupe, le disque qui démontre que Placebo a atteint sa maturié musicale.Des titres comme The bitter end,Second Nite,Special Needs ou encore l'excellent instrumental Bulletproof Cupid en sont la preuve ""audible"". Les guitares énergiques, le mélange rock et électro, les textes et la voix envoutante de Brian Molko, voilà les recettes qui font et feront le succès de ce 4ème opus. Ce disque est à mon sens le meilleur de Placebo. Seul petit bémol: comme toujours, certaines chansons auraient méritées d'être plus longues. Mais ceci n'est qu'un détail....."
5,"Cela ne se sait pas assez, on a actuellement en France un groupe métal de classe mondiale, parmi les meilleurs. Il y a peu de chance que cet album ait du succés en dehors du cercle des métalleux, mais c'est dommage, derrière la brutalité de la forme il y a de l'intelligence et de la musicalité. Un peu comme Meshuggah ou Neurosis. Sans parler des lyrics, qui  sont loin d'être idiots...Si vous aimez celui-là, jetez vous sur le précédent, From Mars To Sirius, un des meilleurs albums métal de ces dernières années."
5,Album après album GOJIRA cofirme tous les éspoirs placés en eux. Bientôt une référence internationale incontournable.
2,"La reprise de ""L'opportuniste"" est un vrai massacre. Bon, l'aventurier aura l'avantage de rappeller de bons souvenirs à de nombreux jeunes de l'époque, c'est tout, c'est déjà ça."
1,"Le retour de tout groupe ayant connu un succes notable auparavant n'est pas forcement synonime de renaissance feconde : Indochine nous le prouve a ses depends. Cet album, annonce par la production comme le retour en grace de nos cowboys au synthe (pourquoi d'ailleurs y avait-il besoin de l'annoncer avant de l'ecouter ?...), est un mauvais remake electro-rock des pires annees 80. Ni originalite, ni melodies soignees, aucun brillant, ni aucun texte a la hauteur, Indochine tombe dans sa propre caricature de groupe sur le retour et oublie d'en etre creatif. Seul le single ""J'ai demande a la lune"" tire son epingle du jeu, meme s'il tire son etonnante melancolie en partie du riff de ""Septembre en attendant"", de Noir Desir. Comme si tout l'album avait ete brode autour de ce hit facilement memorisable...Comme si, une fois le masque enleve, n'apparaissait qu'un visage vieilli et boursoufle. Indochine n'est plus : vive Indochine !"
5,"Incroyable. Je suis TRES agréablement surprise ! Tout d'abord, parlons du support : - Boitier luxe très stylisé ce qui permet d'étudier un peu mieux la jaquette ! :P. - Le contenu : Un dépliant en relief de la jaquette, Des photos du groupe, le poster du stade France, le single little dolls et l'album en version collector. Le dépliant et les photos : Sympa mais les photos du groupe ne sont pas très valorisante, trop sombre, je n'en vois pas bien l'intérêt même si derrière chaque portrait se cache la photo d'une scene de guerre qui donne une bonne idée de l'ambiance de l'album. Le poster du Stade de France : Là, je suis fan ! J'adore cette affiche ! :D Tres belle mise en valeur des membres du groupe... :P Le single little Dolls avec son étonnante jaquette montrant une exécution qui m'avait surprise en tant que fan mais annoncant déjà le fond de ce nouvel album.  - L'album collector : Mais le vrai joyau de ce boitier est là ! Cet album renferme une charge émotionnelle incroyable ! Ayant pour trame de fond la première guerre mondiale, cette album nous rappelle que les guerres sont toujours là, et la souffrance qu'elles engendrent aussi. Plusieurs morceau abordent explicitement ce thème comme ""un ange à ma table"", ""Le Lac"" et la magnifique ""Lettre de métal"" qui m'a fait verser une larme. Cette chanson représente une lettre écrite par un père à son fils avant de partir a la guerre. Sachez que la lettre originale est dans l'album a coté des paroles de la chanson. Bref, ce thème de la guerre 14/18 est l'originalité de cette album d'Indo et est remarquablement bien exploité.  D'autre part, on retrouvera des morceaux plus rock, plus ""indochine"" comme le mystérieux mais néanmoins ""Go Rimbaud, GO !"" et la chanson ""Play Boy"" qui est une saine provocation sur laquelle j'ai flashé ou encore ""L World"" !  En ce qui concerne le deuxième cd bonus : Merci pour le clip de ""you spin me round"" ! :D Les versions ""a capella"" sont très sympa et la chanson ""Mexicane Syndicate"" qui est une chanson a part : le son change du reste de l'album et les paroles sont quant à elle bien realiste des victimes de la ""crise économique"". Bref, étant fan et donc, très peu objective : Cet album est très riche tant au niveau du son que des paroles ! A la fois du indo tout craché et de la nouveauté avec ce fond de Guerre mondiale ! On a l'impression de voyager dans le passé à travers divers personnages. Passant de l'electro vers des morceaux plus lourd, plus rock ou la balade avec un peu d'acoustique... et les paroles : L'émotion est incroyable, on ne peut pas ressortir de cet album indemne, on se retourne l'âme.  J'adore, j'adore, j'adore... Moi aussi Indo ""Je t'aime tant"" ..."
4,"du pur Indochine !!! C'est pas l'album du siècle, mais il est très bon, très agréable. Si vous avez aimé les autres albums, vous aimerez celui-ci"
4,"Un magnifique album qui n'est surement pas le meilleur mais qui est meilleur que le pire. Il regroupe bien toutes les facettes du son Cure comme le voulais Robert Smith avec des titres qui auraient pu appartenir à d'autres album mythiques. Comme the Promise, le chef d'oeuvre de 10 minutes de cet album qui aurait très bien pu appartenir à la Gothik Trilogy: Seventeen Seconds-Faith-Pornography. Ou alors Before Three dans laquelle on reconnait les accents pop de Just like Heaven et de Kiss me kiss me kiss me. Bref, Robert Smith bien aidé par sa formation qu'il qualifie comme la meilleur que The Cure n'ait jamais eu avec un Simon Gallup toujours présent aux côtés de son ami de toujours."
4,"Katerine s'en fout mais il le fait avec talent! Et si vou n'êtes pas d'accord, il vous emmerde!"
2,"Aprés les deux derniers albums studio en anglais de céline , je comptais beaucoup sur cet album pour retrouver la chanteuse que j'apprécie enfin dépouillée de sa robe trés commercial . Hélas , dans ce disque l'originalité joue l'arlésienne avec talent . Un désenchantement me prends à l'écoute de cet album , textes sans aucune recherche , mélodies répétitives et duos improbables avec des auteurs sans voix ni plume . Même Goldman que j'adore me décoit ici . Au final deux-trois chansons qui se tiennent , des clones de chansons de Goldman et d'autres dignes des albums des academyciens . Bref que reste-t-il de notre Céline ? Il vaut mieux réecouter les deux albums précédents en français qu'écouter cette mascarade ."
5,"En fait, c'est vrai qu'il s'agit de l'album réunissant tous ses plus grand succès (Bla bla bla, The Riddle, Another Way, Elisir, Passion, ...) donc ça aide à en faire un très bon cru. Mais au delà des morceaux les plus connus, je trouve que c'est cet album qui reflète le mieux le talent et le génie de création de Gigi d'Agostino avec cette tendance à faire un double album avec 2 CD qui sont différents d'un point de vue rythmique et vocal. Et en fait, cette originalité s'est un peu perdue avec les albums qui ont suivi (et notamment avec L'Amour Toujours II qui est pour moi, un cran en dessous). Voilà pourquoi je trouve que toute la richesse de cet album en fait le meilleur de sa carrière pour le moment. Donc pour ceux qui veulent découvrir cet artiste talentueux, c'est cet album qu'il vous faut. Vous risqueriez de trouver les autres un peu fades et surtout, vous ne vous en feriez peut-être pas la bonne opinion, ce qui serait dommage."
5,"Vivement conseillé aux fans. Musiques comme textes sont travaillés et plus qu'agréables à écouter. Etienne daho revient vraiment avec un bel album avec lequel à la fois on le retrouve et le découvre. La musique m'a totalement charmée, essayez et vous verez..."
5,"Attention,ici Pete,ou Peter de son vrai nom,et ses camarades les Babyshambles,nous livrent ici un album remarquable. Entre ballades accoustiques,chansons Jazzy/Blues et véritables morceaux Punk Rock déjantés,cet opus se révèle vraiment complet,et il sera difficile de s'en lasser,une fois acquis. A acheter,de toute urgence!!"
2,"Un groupe de filles. Avec de beaux yeux. Super. Et surtout : une attitude ! Voilà le secret, ça ouvre les colonnes de Rock et Folk qui ne sait plus comment faire pour masquer la moyenne d'âge de sa rédaction... Les misérables 26 minutes de ce premier album montrent un groupe sans relief, avec un niveau musical qui oscille entre les Ramones les plus basiques et dans le meilleur des cas les titres les plus simples des Strokes.  Faire du bon rock sans bien maîtriser son instrument, c'est possible, mais il faut un petit quelque chose. On se frotte les yeux de constater qu'une major a pu signer de telles débutantes... Dans les années 80, des groupes comme les Calamités faisaient nettement mieux... Au travail mesdemoiselles ou attention à retourner immédiatement à la fac..."
2,"Horreur, nous voilà revenus comme dans les pires heures du punk puisque, à nouveau, certaines maisons de disque semblent trouver intéressant de signer des groupes (comme celui-ci, mais il y en a d'autres...) qui ne savent ni jouer, ni chanter, et encore moins composer ne serait-ce qu'une seule chanson digne de ce nom. A la vérité, il n'y aurait, en théorie, aucune raison de s'attarder sur un groupe pareil (jeu basique de chez basique, voix faiblarde, textes à hurler de rire, compositions inexistantes, franchement, n'importe quel groupe de lycée envoyé en studio ferait aussi bien). Mais si on se permet d'insister et de perdre de son temps précieux à pousser ce menu coup de gueule, c'est au vu de la presse incroyablement dithyrambique que ces demoiselles, au demeurant jolies, ont reçu ces dernières semaines. C'est simple, en lisant les articles qui leur étaient consacrés, Les Plastiscines représentaient ni plus ni moins que l'avenir du rock et les descendantes les plus légitimes des Ramones et des Buzzcocks... Franchement, moi, quand j'ai entendu leur premier single, le très justement nommé ""Loser"", j'ai plus eu l'impression d'entendre une version vaguement rock des Spice Girls (remember Girl Power ?) que les Ramones qui, eux au moins, écrivaient de vraies mélodies par dessus leur boucan. Quant à représenter un quelconque avenir, c'est simple : si le futur du rock c'est ça, le rock est déjà mort. A éviter..."
5,"Quoi de mieux qu'un best of pour résumer la superbe carrière de Mr McKnight, le roi de la soul contemporraine. Tous ses plus grands tubes sont présents sur cette compilation de grande qualité. Vous aurez même droit à 2 inédits, dont le magnifique ""Let Me Love You"". Alors si vous ne connaissez pas encore ce génie qu'est Brian McKnight, laissez-vous séduire par cet album qui contient certains des plus beaux slows soul de la décennie, comme ""Anytime"", ""Back At One"", ""One Last Cry"" ou ""Love Of My Life"". Magnifique !"
5,"Album solo FA-BU-LEUX ! ! ! ! Les 15 chansons de l'album tiennent du génie ! On a déjà une voix parfaite qui allie parfaitement rap et chant ce qui fait déjà l'originalité de l'album, le tube « Doo Wop (That Thing) » le prouve. Style absolument à part ! Tantôt soul avec les magnifiques « Nothing Even Matters » en duo avec le King du genre D'Angelo et « Ex Factor » qui a aussi été un single, et tantôt un style plutôt hip hop soul à la Mary J. Blige avec par exemple « When It's Hurts So Bad » ou encore son duo avec justement Mary J. « I Used To Love Him ». A noter la présence de Carlos Santana sur « To Zion » qui apporte avec sa guitare un plus indéniable ! On rajoute le fait que la qualité des lyrics est excellente et on se retrouve comblé par cet album ! Bref un grand moment de musique en compagnie de l'ex Fugees ! Grand coup de chapeau à Lauryn !"
5,"Bob Thiele (producteur pour Impulse, et donc de Coltrane) déclarait à propos de ce disque : ""la raison pour laquelle cet enregistrement est sorti provient du fait que j'ai suggéré à John de montrer aux journalistes de jazz ce dont il était capable. Entre autres, de jouer d'une part des standards américains et de faire, d'autre part un album chanté.Je lui avais dit de se trouver quelqu'un capable de chanter, tout ça pour les faire sourciller et attirer leur attention. Après ""Ballads"", je pensais qu'il aurait fait quelque chose avec une chanteuse comme Sarah Vaughan par exemple. C'est alors qu'il m'a confié qu'il aimerait faire un album avec Johnny Hartman et cela m'a totalement surpris. Je n'avais rien anticipé de la sorte.(...) Hartmann n'était pas du tout connu. Il ne faisait l'objet d'aucune renommée. Ce n'était qu'un bon chanteur de ballades. Je ne le classerais même pas dans les chanteurs de jazz. C'était comme si John Coltrane avait enregistré un disque avec Jean Sablon!"" Disque de circonstances, donc : les critiques éreintaient Coltrane. Il fallait les ""amadouer"". Séance du 7 mars 63, 7 titres dans la boite! Un disque unique : ce sera le seul réalisé avec un chanteur. 7 ritournelles du répertoire des standards de la musique populaire américaine. 7 titres transcendés par le Quartet, le chant d'Hartman restant anecdotique quand Coltrane se permet le luxe d'être LA seule véritable voix de l'enregistrement, illuminant de son génie ces rengaines sans intérêt. Une fois de plus, il a pétri la matière roturière de choses pour en ressortir l'or pur. Opération alchimique et magique."
5,Jamiroquai est un dieu... Quelque soit l'humeur sa musique reussira toujours a me donner une peche de folie. A avoir sur soit pour ces petits moments de deprimes impromptus...
1,"Le disco est une de mes musiques préférées, mais en voilà un dont je n'ai jamais compris le succès. Très loin des sommets du genre constitués par Boney M ou Donna Summer, Cerrone n'a jamais su composer de jolies mélodies, ses morceaux donnent l'impression de notes choisies au hasard, sans unité, sans cette imagination, ces reprises, ces envolées apanages des bons compositeurs. Pour moi, le disco c'est autre chose que de taper comme un malade sur une batterie, à un point tel qu'on l'avait justement surnommé ""le bûcheron"". C'est vraiment ce genre d'artistes au rabais qui a ouvert la voie à la musique sans imagination qui est devenue hélas notre lot quotidien."
1,"je l'ai écouté après l'avoir emprunté à mon frère et je suis dsl de le dire mais franchement il est très décevant, c insipide dommage on pouvait s'attendre à un peu mieux"
1,"Je ne rajouterai pas de l'huile sur le feu. Seulement que ce gars a un réel besoin d'êtres suivi psychiatriquement et je sais de quoi je cause (dépressif moi-même sous antidépresseur etc.). Cette dernière affaire en justice n'aide pas les choses. Michael est un danger pour lui, pour ses enfants et ceux des autres. Son règne est fini et pourtant malgré ses derniers titres médiocres voire nulles, il aura toujours son noyau de fans durs car Michael, c'est une énigme, un alien, un original et puis c'est aussi l'auteur talentueux de Billie Jean, Beat it ou ma préférée ""Man in the mirror""..."
1,"Comment se laisser prendre à ces tentatives grossières de récupération tous azimuts ? Mika, gars sympathique à ce qu'il parait, est incapable de sortir le bon côté de ses multi-influences et nous sert un plat peu appétissant constitué de glam-rock incompris, de disco avarié et de sous-variété innommable. Il a beau tenté d'imiter Freddy Mercury, il n'est pour l'instant bon qu'à piailler de manière insupportable sur ses ""compositions"" informes. A éviter d'urgence...si vous le pouvez."
2,"J'ai acheté l'album de cette artiste par impulsion après avoir lu les nombreux commentaires dythirambiques sur cet album.  Cependant le résultat final est - à mes oreilles - incohérent, voire décevant malgré une sonorité et certains arrangements dignes des chanteuses soul des années 60 et 70."
2,"AH LE VOILA LE BEST OF TANT ATTENDU DE LA MADONNE! ET BIEN ON S'ARRETE, ON REGARDE ET ON PASSE SON CHEMIN. RIEN DE BIEN ORIGINAL! JE M'ATTENDAIS A UN DOUBLE CD AU MOINS, MEME PAS. OU SONT DONC PASSES LES ""RAIN"", ""THIS USED TO BE MY PLAYGROUND"", ""AMERICAN PIE"": Y'EN A PAS! ET LES INEDITS, ON PEUT TOUJOURS LES CHERCHER... UN BEST OF, OUI, MAIS RIEN DE PLUS!"
1,"Ce disque devrait concourir dans la catégorie des musiques les plus ennuyeuses au monde! si vous adorez Norah Jones (je l'ai vu en concert, j'ai failli tomber de mon siège en m'endormant) dès le petit déjeuner, ce disque est pour vous (les autres écoute de la musique faite avec de la passion)."
5,"Album sublime, avec les années soixante en musique mais à l'heure actuelle, tout Le décor accéré de Quentin Tarentino qui nous en met pleins les oreilles.... génial"
1,"Album à supprimer de ma discothèque au plus vite. Paroles affligeantes ! Grrrr Ecoutez les précédents albums, vous perdrez moins votre temps."
5,Alicia Keys mèle agréablement sa somptueuse voix avec son piano. Cet album est sublime. Je le conseille à tous les fans de RnB
4,"""Southside"" est le 1er album du groupe Texas et pas l'un des moindres. On trouve dans cet album tout le style qui ont fait la renommée du groupe. Je le conseille vivement ainsi que son Best-of qui regroupe une grande partie de ses meilleurs chansons!"
2,"Prince nous a sorti des albums d'anthologie(sign of the times,purple rain, rainbow children).mais il a décidé de faire dans l'alimentaire.c son choix! mais les fans de toujours, dont je suis ,sont très déçus de cette nouvelle orientation ""artistique"".j'irai le voir en live! là au moins c toujours très bon.bientot une date à Paris? il se dit qu'on est toujours plus sévère avec ceux qu'on aime.amer,vous avez dit amer?"
2,"A la fin des années 80 le climat musical se régénère: Fini la new wave! Place désormais aux premiers tubes House, la Rave music etc... C'est dans ce contexte que les trois membres restants décidèrent de produire un nouvel opus. Malheureusement celui-ci s'avera être un petit flop de part l'accueil reçu des critiques mais également commercial avec des ventes décevantes (3 millions tout de même). C'est peu pour le groupe (à l'époque) mais finalement beaucoup à l'écoute de ce ""Big thing"". Hésitant entre la pop et la house, l'album en sort assez contrasté avec un son plus ""durci"" en ce qui concerne les deux singles ""I don't want your love"" (#14 GB,#4 USA Sept.88) et ""All she wants is"" (#9 GB,#22 USA Déc.88) plutôt réussis. Les intimistes ""Too late marlene"" et ""Palomino"" sont également intéressants mais c'est à peu prés tout. Le reste est plus ou moins ""sans intérêt"" comme ""Big thing"", ""Do you believe in shame"", ""Lake shore driving"", ""The edge of america"" sans oublier ""Drug"" horrible du début à la fin (ici en deux exemplaires, chouette!!!).  Pour info l'album aurait pu être de meilleure facture si cette fameuse boite à rythmes typique de l'époque n'était présente."
5,"Dagoba c'est pas compliqué, c'est le parfait mix entre les 2+gros groupes superaméricain à cartons du néo trash, je parle de slipknot et fear factory.Ce group a tt simplement ce coté noir et goth de slipknot sur lequel sont superposés tt un tas de bruitagse influence terminator et 1chanteur déjanté qui par moment fait pensé a C.Taylor, mais +frappant:a B.Bell !!les gros cais de fear factory les descente a la Joey complète un instru ultra technik ki s'amuse,en milieu 2morceau,à jouer en décalé!Mais surtou DAGOBA nont pas trouvé le juste milieu entre technique et vitesse,non non..Ils perfore ds les 2!!!en gro DAGOBA c'est deux groupe en 1!!!Pourquoi hésité??"
2,"et bien je pensais que la reunion de 2 poid lourd du rap weast cost nous donnerai quelquechose de bon et bien apres ecoute ce n'est pas le cas la premiere parti de l'opus n'est pas mauvais avec des intru typique de quick ""fuck ya'all"" et ""hey playa"" et j'en passe mais il y as des ovnis comme exodus the appeal qui gache un peu la seconde parti de l'opus et kurupt n'est pas au mieux de ca forme derriere le mic bon quick on savait deja qu'il etais pas tres bon rappeur mais plutot bon producteur   mais a vous de jugez et bonne ecoute"
2,"Cet album m'a beaucoup déçue de la part des Coors, ce qui faisait leur charme semble s'être évanoui... C'est bien dommage d'avoir laissé de côté leurs mélodies irlandaises pour ce disque. Les chansons ne sont pas mal mais on s'en lasse vite, et elles sont presque agaçantes à la longue. Pour moi, cet album n'a rien à voir avec les trois précédents que j'avais adorés. Le passage à la pop ne m'a vraiment pas convaincue..."
5,"Un album magique qui vous plonge dans plus d'une heure de concert du grand Manu... L'énergie de la Mano réincarné dans la Radio Bemba. Avec les chefs-d'oeuvre de - justement - Mano Negra (Machine Gun, Peligro, Casa Babylon, Blood And Fire, Mala Vida, The Monkey, King Kong Five), des souvenirs du culte Clandestino (Welcome To Tijuana, El Viento, Por El Suelo, Bongo Bong, Clandestino, La Despedida, Minha Galera), des perles du récent Proxima Estacion Esperanza (Mr Bobby, Que Paso Que Paso, La Primavera, Promiscuity), et de nouveaux morceaux (Por Donde Saldra El Sol, Radio Bemba, Pinocchio, Cahi en la Trampa, Rumba de Barcelona). Un futur classique."
5,"Un album de référence à posséder absolument pour tous les fans... et les autres ! Disque enregistré en 1977, qu'on se le dise, ils sont forts ces ""Ricains"", quel son, quelle musique !!! Tout le ""gratin"" des meilleurs musiciens de l'époque y jouent : Aux Drums : Steve Gadd ( Grandiose sur AJA !!! ), Bernard Purdie, Jim Keltner, Rick Marotta ... A la basse : Chuck Rainey sur tous les titres - Guitars : Le ""grand"" Larry Carlton, Lee Ritenour, Steve Khan ... Et tous les autres : Tom Scott, Joe Sample, Wayne Shorter, Michael McDonald ... Impossible de citer tout le monde tellement il y en a !!! De la ""Grande"" musique californienne comme seuls les américains savent la faire, disque à acheter les yeux fermés, no problem ! Emilio ( Dordogne )."
4,"cette album est surprenant car le son est nettement plus clair que sur les precedent comme si ils avaient ""nettoyé"" leur guitares pour un son moin gras.  En conclusion c'est un album pour ceux qui aime les fenders et les gibsons qui degouline de partout avec une voix plus travailler pour nous offrir des chansons plus melodique"
1,"Comment ont-ils pu après un premier album d'une créativité et d'une puissance inouie, tomber dans la facilité à ce point et accoucher d'un album aussi décevant et sans intérêt ?  L'apât du gain sans doute et la volonté du mégalo chanteur fred durst de régner sur les charts américains. L'originlité n'y est plus, place à l'efficacité commerciale. Les riffs de guitare sont sans surprise et tranchent radicalement avec les merveilles du 1er album. Les paroles prouvent l'égocentrisme du leader chanteur qui nous rappelle au bon souvenir qu'il ne sait pas chanter même en faisant semblant et en mixant sa voix à fond. Et histoire de vendre encore un peu plus, ils ont fait appel à des guests stars en les personnes de method man et jonathan davis pour des chansons plus que moyennes. Bref une énorme déception et un album à éviter."

Et histoire de vendre encore un peu plus, ils ont fait appel à des guests stars en les personnes de method man et jonathan davis pour des chansons plus que moyennes. Bref une énorme déception et un album à éviter."
1,"limp bizkit est au metal ce que britney spears est a la musique!!! C'est a dire honteux et commercial!!! Cet album surf sur une mode lancee par korn et n'ajoute rien au genre!!! Les musiciens n'ont aucun talent , surtout wes borland (guitare) qui n'a aucun son et plagie la plupart de ses riffs (ex: nookie sur les red hots) ! Bref si vous voulez un vrai disque hip hop metal allez voir du cote de biohazard ou de body count"
2,"Que faire quand on est au sommet du monde pop ? Forcément redescendre. Avec U2, la chute a été brutale. Passer des monuments « The Joshua Tree » et « Achtung Baby » à des galettes insignifiantes comme « Zooropa » et « Pop » en avait consterné plus d'un à l'époque. Les fans révisionnistes font leur boulot, et nous disent ailleurs dans cette page tout le génie de « Zooropa ». Sachez qu'il n'en est rien, ce Cd est un vaste fourre-tout sans queue ni tête d'où surnagent sans trop de peine l'excellente balade « Babyface » réminiscente des splendeurs d' « Achtung Baby » et le dernier titre « The Wanderer » chanté par Johnny Cash. Le reste est composé de morceaux (écrits sur la route au cours de la tournée mégalo « Zoo TV Tour ») où tout le monde (groupe, Eno et Flood à la production) expérimente. Sommet de la futilité : « Numb » avec nappes électro, guitares filtrées et l'Edge qui rappe avec sa voix passée au vocodeur.  En fait, la plupart des titres n'aurait dû figurer que comme bonus sur des Cd-singles, ces objets destinés aux fans purs et durs. Malheureusement, les U2 en ont fait un album destiné à tous. Le premier gros faux pas d'une discographie jusque là très intéressante."
4,"Au début des années 80, les Stranglers étaient composés de Hugh Cornwell chant et guitare, du Franco-britanique Jean-Jacques Burnel, et de Dave greenfield et jet black. Ce groupe a commencé sa carrière vers 1974-1975. En 1977, ils sortent les albums ""Rattus norvegicus"" et ""no more heroes"". Ils vont être immédiatement considéré comme punk. Au fil des ans avec ""the raven"", ""la folie"" et bien sur ""Auréal sculpture: 1984"" on va s'appercevoir que ce groupe n'a rien de punk. On dit même que les Doors les ont influencé. Cet album est génial avec des morceaux comme ""Skin deep"", ""no mercy"", ""punch and judy"" ou encore ""Spain"". A la fin des années 1980, après le hit ""Always the sun"", Cornwell quitte les Stranglers. Le groupe n'aura plus que des succès d'estime. Ce qui me reste après toutes ces années, c'est bien sur leur musique mais également leur look (tout de noir vétue). Groupe génial."
5,"Kurupt,Daz, toute l'equipe de death row records du moment est présent sur cet album qui est magnifique magré les années jusqua présent je l'écoute avec le meme plaisir. c'est tout simplement le meilleur, la G Funk a son meilleur niveau. Cela me manque aujourdhui pourquoi changer une recette qui marche. vive le retour de la G Funk."
5,"Pour moi qui adore ce genre de rap ce cd est magnifique c'est peut etre le meilleur toute catégorie, Pete Rock est un génie de la production à base de soul. Dès le début avec ""In the house"" on se laisse transporter, personelement kan ca va pa je met ca et ca tourne en boucle, a conseiller aussi la 10 ""tell me"" mais toutes se valent telmen ce cd est bon. Il faudrai mettre 6 étoile! Pete rock is in the house! CL is in the house bye"
5,Aucune mauvaise surprise le maître des mots &amp; des lyriques reste le seul maître de la prose combat. Véritable musicologue &amp; mélo-man ...Pa de bleuf!
5,"Mais arrêtez de critiquer Load ! Pourquoi tant d'acharnement sur cet album depuis sa sortie en 1996 et encore aujourd'hui ? Il est certain qu'avec Load Metallica a sûrement déçu ses fans de la première heure attendant des ""four horsemen"" un nouvel album de trash metal. Mais le précédent et excellent ouvrage du groupe sorti 5 ans plus tôt sous le titre de Black Album avait déjà laissé entrevoir un léger virage quant à l'orientation musicale des 4 de San Francisco. Load a donc fait perdre à Metallica ses fans ""trash"" mais lui a fait gagner un grand nombre de fans grâce à la diffusion du single ""Until It Sleeps"" sur les ondes (même en France, c'est dire !). Il en ressort que certaines personnes ont lâchement critiqué Metallica, les accusant de traîtrise envers le metal et en leur reprochant d'avoir donné un côté commercial à leur musique dans le seul but de faire de l'argent. Mais il faut ouvrir les yeux : les gars de Metallica ont près de 40 balais et il est normal qu'à cet âge l'acnée disparaîsse et que l'on devienne un peu plus mature, tout en s'assagissant; et c'est exactement le chemin suivi par la musique du groupe au fil des ans. De ce fait, Load est un album lourd, pesant, avec des sonorités vieux hard rock et même blues (""Bleeding Me"", ""Ronnie""), et il faut dire que Metallica excelle aussi dans ce style ! Si vous voulez écouter un très bon album de Hard Rock, choisissez ""Load"", par contre, si vous partez avec l'intention d'écouter du trash, passez votre chemin..."
1,"Rhapsody,c'est excellent au début puis au fil des albums on remarque que c'est toujours la meme chose.Une intro symphonique,deux titres speed,un mid-tempo,un ou deux autres titres speeds puis une ballades,un titre speed et enfin un long morceaux qui finit l'album.Au depart,on trouve ça bien parce que c'est speed,mélodique,accrocheurs mais on se rend vite compte de la faiblesse richesse des morceaux.La batterie avec la double pédale mitraillette cela devient gonflant.Pour les solos ça va.Dans POTD,le dernier titre est nul mais vraiment très nul.Le debut de celui-ci est relativement bien mais c'est du bourrage inintérressant.Le refrain est repris beaucoup trop de fois.Ensuite vient un bon solo de guitare.Alors après c'est n'importe quoi le titre se finit par un narrateur qui parle pendant je ne sais combien de temps et le morceaux se finit comme ça presque sans musique. Désolé pour les fans mais si Rhapsody continue comme ça il n'atteindra jamais des groupes Gamma Ray,Blind Guardian,Edguy..."
5,"Cet album n'a pas pris une ride. Son accessibilité est immédiate que l'on aime le rock, le punk ou les 60's. En un album tout est là : compos, rage, execution avec en plus la french touch de Dominique Laboubée dans son chant plus arrogant que violent. L'album comporte 8 titres bonus en plus provenant des 45t introuvables édités sur le premier label indépendant français Mélodie Massacre... Foncez!"
1,"Pas encore écouté l'album, mais on nous bassine depuis qq temps avec le 'simple' Batifole, chanson affligeante s'il en est. Je n'ai rien contre la voix de TW, même si son côté parfois poussif-j'ai-trop-bu-j'ai-la-bouche-pâteuse peu friser l'énervant. Mais ce texte, quelle lourdeur, quel manque d'imagination, de poésie, de magie. Il veut jouer avec les mots mais sans en avoir le goût ni la volonté. Le tout sur quelques accords dépouillés sans aucun intérêt. Une vraie oeuvre de potes de 5ème qui ont écrit ça en cours de français entre 2 exos de grammaire parce-qu'ils viennent d'apprendre un nouveau mot : batifoler. L'album a sûrement du meilleur en lui, mais que ce soit ce titre qui nous soit imposé sur les ondes est véritablement consternant. Navrant."
1,"Aïe aïe aïe... Le cas Mark Knopfler... Par quoi commencer ? Commençons d'abord par reconnaître la virtuosité de ce guitariste et la finesse de son jeu. Voila. C'est fait. Malheureusement, aussi doué soit-il, ce bon vieux marco nous ressert une fois de plus sa soupe ô combien indigeste. Une espèce de variétoche teintée de rock fm qui ferait passer luis mariano pour sid vicious (ou inversement...). Certes, je dois l'admettre, je n'aime pas tonton mark (contrairement à mon père, vrai-faux babacool soixante-huitard, qui a perdu toute notion de dicernement a force de fumer de l'herbe, de boire du pastis et d'écouter de la musique traditionnelle ouzbèque). Mais cette aversion est justifiée. Premièrement parceque 90% de ce que sort mr Knopfler est tout simplement mauvais. Deuxièmement, et je vous le demande, comment peut-on respecter un olibrius qui a bâti son succés en volant et en s'appropriant le travail d'un autre ? Je parle bien évidemment de ce pauvre J.J. Cale, tombé dans les oubliettes, évincé du succés, écrasé par le rouleau compresseur teuton Dire Straits. Car oui mesdames et messieurs, (re)plongez vous dans la discographie de mr Cale et vous (re)découvrirez l'inventeur du style ""laidback"". Mark Knopfler, aussi beau gosse soit-il, est un escroc doublé d'un fumiste. Je vous l'accorde, ma critique est inutile et frôle le néant intellectuel mais justice est enfin rendue. Je mets quand même une étoile à cet album pour sa pochette. Et parceque l'individu qui a composé ""six blade knife"" ne peut pas être totalement médiocre. Allez, au plaisir d'y croire un jour mr Knopfler."
5,"par rapport à l'original deux titres bonus qui sont très bons, you're gonna change, reprise honky tonk de hank williams et root like a rose, une ballade irlandaise magnifique. achat très recommandé, cet album est le plus country de cette période d'emmylou et signe le retour en force du bluegrass les duos vocaux avec ricky skaggs sont fabuleux si vous aimez la country foncez!"
5,"Cette album est tout simplement magique ! Un album charnière de la carrière de miss Evangeline.  Un album très accessible, qui trouve un cotè très pop avec une musique country des plus envoutante de délicieuse. Dans les titres de l'album, une superbe surprise, ""On the Radio"" de Donna Summer, une version avec un accent country mais pas trop, magique et sublime. Cette album est superbe, sorti en 1983, il n'a pas pris une ride, la production est impeccable et les chansons superbe. Un must chez les musts !!"
2,"Cet album, c'est la cour de récré de trois gamins surdoués qui profitent de l'absence du copain (Petrucci) parti faire un tour... Constitué de prises sans ligne directive, ce CD aurait pu constituer un CD bonus dans un coffret reprenant les 2 albums de Liquid Tension Experiment, sans plus. Préférez les albums solos de Rudess ou Levin."
5,"Dernier album de Metallica avec feu Cliff Burton, Master Of Puppets n'est pas un album comme les autres. En effet, au-delà de ce metal décomplexé, de cette exploration de l'âme humaine, ce disque est avant tout une sorte de nouveau continent. Un territoire insolent dont on ne mesure pas immédiatement l'étendue, tant son contenu dépasse par moment les frontières de certains mondes. A son sujet, si parler de mutation s'impose à l'esprit, c'est surtout en le replaçant dans son contexte que ce disque prend toute sa démesure. A l'époque, la concurrence est rude. Tandis que Slayer et Megadeth viennent de propulser la rage et les ténèbres sur des chemins insoupçonnés, certains s'interrogent sur l'avenir. S'interrogent sur les perspectives d'évolution d'un thrash qui, hormis la surenchère, ne laisse rien augurer de nouveau. Cela, les Four Horsemen l'ont bien compris. Aussi, sans qu'il soit question de compromis, ni de céder à l'apaisement, le groupe va imposer un nouvel ordre musical fait de chaos, d'émotion et d'intelligence. Un chaos fondateur en quelque sorte. Le genre d'étincelle de fin de vie et de début de tout, dont l'impact sur l'environnement se manifeste encore aujourd'hui. Il y a quelques mois, pour lustrer sa fureur suite à un premier album radical, Metallica n'avait pas hésité à introduire quelques subtilités inattendues dans Ride The Lightning. Sur le coup, bien que ces injections n'aient pas fait l'unanimité, ce monument d'angoisse sourde - une pure réussite - avait cependant laissé entrevoir la possibilité d'une autre forme de colère : mieux pensée, plus réfléchie. Ainsi, très attendu, sujet à tous les fantasmes, c'est par la grâce d'un troisième enregistrement surdoué que les américains vont anoblir définitivement leur thrash metal. Car, au-delà d'une nouvelle forme d'écriture, d'une éloquence parfois progressive, Master of Puppets est avant tout un album crucial. Crucial, parce que derrière sa toute puissance, il hisse le tragique, l'émotion à des niveaux inespérés. Cependant, si comme pour son prédécesseur l'aspect mélodique y est renforcé, ce qui en fait un objet rare reste cette faculté d'avoir su canaliser la matière pour gagner en maturité. Musicalement tout d'abord : son titre éponyme en est la démonstration flagrante. Mais aussi grâce des textes mettant en avant les aspects les plus sombres de la nature humaine. Pour celui qui le rencontre aujourd'hui, disons le sans détour, il y quelque chose de shakespearien dans le monde de Master of Puppets. Aussi, derrière les rythmes survoltés de Battery, la noirceur oppressante de The Thing That Should Not Be, rien d'étonnant à ce qu'on y retrouve l'homme. L'homme submergé par le mal qui l'entoure. Cet homme que l'on voudrait convaincre d'une faute originelle. Au final, on l'aura comprit, le quatuor ne signe pas seulement un album que l'on peut qualifier d'exception - tout a déjà été dit sur l'inévitable Orion, les riffs syncopés de Disposable Heroes, ce bassiste hors norme qu'était Burton - il va beaucoup plus loin. Plus loin que tout autre par ses prises de risques. Plus loin, parce qu'il ose jusqu'à sonder la violence pour y trouver l'origine d'une fracture plus nuancée. D'une manière générale, en autant d'assauts subtils et de colères impétueuses qu'il n'en faut pour le dire, ce qui force le respect dans ce disque se résume en deux mots : autorité et conviction. En quelque sorte, dirons certains, la genèse selon Metallica."
1,"Fallait-il encore espérer la moindre part de créativité venant de la Simmons &amp; Stanley corporation? A l'écoute de ce nouvel et tant attendu album, la réponse est un prévisible ""non"".  Un enchainement de plans déjà entendus agencés les uns aux autres, que l'on pourrait mélanger entre eux pour refaire d'autres morceaux sans âme. Les 2 premiers morceaux de l'album sont les seuls qui me restent dans le crâne, le reste en est dégoulinant de clichés kissiens qui donnent juste envie de se précipiter sur leurs vieux enregistrements des années 70. Mieux vaut l'original à la copie. Eric Singer singe Peter Criss, pendant que Tommy Tayer singe Ace Frehley. On ne sent plus la passion et la cohésion des morceaux propre à ce groupe jadis mythique, malgré une production brut et très rock s'inscrivant dans la même démarche qu'un ""Rock and Roll Over"". Kiss ne se réinvente plus depuis 15 ans, et se mord la queue. Ça sent la bonne intention, mais malheureusement trop le repompage... on pense à Poison, à Aerosmith, mais aussi au ""flying high again"" d'Ozzy Osbourne sur ""Never Enough"". C'est osé de la part de Kiss d'oser décrire ce disque comme le meilleur depuis ""Destroyer"". ""Lick It Up"", Creatures of The Night, ""Dynastie"" ou ""Crazy Night"" sont des albums qui surpassent très largement ce ""sonic flop"". Plus un schéma marketing visant à recycler leurs inspirations du passé qu'une vrai démarche artistique, mieux vaut tout de suite se rabattre sur le magistral nouvel album d'Ace Frehley ""Anomaly"", qui de son côté a tourné la page et a su rester honnête en nous livrant 12 nouvelles superbes compos."
2,"Cet album n'a que deux seuls mérites: a. Dio est un extraordinaire chanteur et il s'en donne à coeur joie dans tout l'album. A croire qu'il a été ""écrit"" pour qu'il nous émerveille de ses vocalises. b. Que 30 ans (!) plus tard, il ne reste plus que Dio. La formule magique Dio/Iommi/Butler qui, sous le nom de Black Sabbath, nous avaient pondu deux disques absolument majestueux (et indispensables à toute cd-thèque qui se respecte), à savoir ""Heaven and Hell"" (oui, cela ne s'invente pas) et ""Mob Rules"", et bien cette magie n'opère plus. Dio a beau essayer de sauver l'ouvrage, il se retrouve bien seul. Certes, parfois, comme un écho d'un flamboyant passé, on se prend à espérer retrouver ce que ce trio avait produit, comme par exemple dans Bible Black. Mais le reste, c'est d'un ennuyeux pas possible: Dio, ok; Musique = c'est toujours la même chose; électrocardiogramme pratiquement plat. Mais où est donc passé la rythmique endiablée de ""Neon Knights"", ""Heaven and Hell"", ""Turn up the night"", ""Voodoo"", ""The Mob rules""? De tout cela il ne reste rien. C'est sans doute ma faute d'avoir voulu croire à une résurrection de ce trio. Dommage."
1,"La liberté de création pour un groupe c'est de pouvoir être prétentieux et pompeux après avoir été lumineux et audacieux. Dans le genre Archive est à l'avant-garde. ""Controlling the crowds"" atteint des sommets : morceaux interminables (10 mn dès le 1er titre !), plages musicales baclées tantot ""heavy metal"" (la fin de ""dangervisit"") ou guimauve (""funeral"")... et toujours cette influence PInk Floyd mal digérée (omniprésente sur tout l'album, ""words on signs"" en particulier). Quelques bons moments surnagent (""razed to the ground"" ou le début de ""dangervisit"") mais ne suffisent pas à sauver un ensemble bien indigeste. En conclusion : Vous avez adoré Londinium ? Moi aussi ! Alors n'allez pas plus loin !"
1,"J'ai essayé de faire un effort en écoutant le cd, me persuadant que ""Hého"" n'était qu'un mauvais single commercial.Mais non!!!J'aurais pas dû faire cet effort!Les paroles volent au ras des paquerettes et les voix nasillardes des deux compères agaces au plus haut point.Les musiques sont formatés elles aussi!Faut bien que des jeunes adolescentes dépensent leur argent d'poche..."
5,"J'ai acheté ce CD suite au succès incontesté de ""Parce qu'on vient de loin"".  Un album riche d'une histoire personnelle, avec des textes poignants et poétiques à souhait. Outre le talent d'auteur de Corneille, on souligne des mélodies très actuelles et innovatrices.  Coup de coeur perso: Seul au monde.  Un véritable show man, j'attends son prochain album avec impatience!!!"
1,"Les albums de Bjork demandent souvent un peu de temps et plusieurs écoutes pour être appréciés mais celui là... Rien à faire. L'émotion ne passe pas, les titres se succèdent sans qu'un air ne se détache, sans qu'une mélodie ne s'imprime. A trop vouloir se distinguer, Bjork en oublie la musique, l'émotion et le plaisir d'écoute. A tel point que même Vespertine, pourtant déjà assez particulier, parait pop et léger en comparaison. Bref, un bel album à mettre en évidence sur la table du salon, à côté de la collection de Txxxrama, mais à ne surtout pas mettre dans la chaine hi-fi."
1,"Amis musicologues, sociologues , ethnologues ou simples curieux, investissez quelques deniers dans ce cd de Lynnsha. Ensuite placez le dans un coffre fort,vous laisserez ainsi aux générations futures un témoignage de la nullité de la variet r'n'bi francaise du debut des années 2000 ..En effet, Lynnsha a fait fort- malgrés la concurrence redoutable des Luna, Saya ,Melissa,Nadiya et autres- et nous a pondu là un album qui restera dans l'histoire comme une pierre angulaire, un de ces albums qui marquent une epoque comme ont pu l'etre ""Pet Sounds""  ou ""my génération"" ,  , de ceux dont certains parlent encore des sanglots dans la voix 30ans plus tard comme  .... En effet , outre la musique, melange d'une banalité sans fin de hiphop- rap-dance-electro, il faut s'attacher aux paroles , un must , dans le genre il sera difficile de faire pire, quoique Vitaa .. Mais quelques extraits valent mieux qu'un long discours : ""Hommes femmes: sans les femmes que feraient les hommes dis moi/sans les hommes que seraient les femmes dis moi/ vous les hommes constamment en train de mentir/ nous les femmes on attend du reve et de la passion.."" ""rendez vous: chez mon coiffeur j'ai rendez vous/je dois m'activer à trouver un style branché,histoire d'assurer/j'ai rendez vous et j'y cours/je serai la plus belle pour aller diner.."" Tiens ca ne vous rappelle rien? la plus belle pour aller danser.  Alors Lynnsha si tu veux pour ton prochain album , j'ai composé une chanson , la voici :  ""Déja 10 heures je dois aller acheter du beurre puis du pain et des billets de train puis chez le boucher prendre de la viande hachée sans oublier de sortir la poubelle et je me ferai belle car cette aprés midi je vois mon chéri"" Dis moi vite si tu es intéressée, sinon Amel Bent et Vitaa la voudraient bien sur leur prochain album."
1,"Matt, en voyant son album je m'suis dit ""ouais pourquoi pas, il est considéré comme le meilleur artiste RnB français donc on va écouter ça"" resultat: AFFLIGEANT!!!!!! Cet album est inécoutable pour plusieurs raisons: On a 21 chansons dont attention 8 interludes qui n'apportent mais alors strictement rien!!!!!! mais à la rigueur c'est pas ça le plus important...Les paroles de ses chansons sont d'une stupidité et d'une futilité digne d'une Lorie sauf stylé ghetto!! C'est bien joli les ""bouge ton boule sur le dance floor"" ou les ""t'es bonne t'es la plus belle go"" ca va 5 min mais quand on se rend compte que ces débilités prennent plus de la moitié de l'album on peut se demander de qui on se moque!! il suffit d'écouter ""Hotel Motel"" ""Wicked"" ""Chabine"" ""Block V.I.P"" ""Paparazzi"" pour voir la pietre qualité des paroles!!! On pourrait alors proner la recherche musicale... mais ouais bof c'est du déjà entendu et ça depuis pas mal de temps avec le RnB américain...Et je veux bien que Mr Matt clame haut et fort qu'R.Kelly est un génie mais est ce que c'etait necessaire de faire presque du plagia niveau production sur ""Chabine"" ""Block V.I.P"" ou encore sur ""Paparazzi""! il peut dire que c'est un clin d'oeil au maître mais pour moi c'est un manque évident de créativité! Mieux vaut acheter un bon CD d'R.Kelly dans ce cas.....Alors je me dit que peut etre les ballades seront meilleures mais rien! les paroles sont d'un narcissisme! (on sait Matt que t'es une Star, que t'es beau pas la peine de dire que c'est dur pour toi ou pour ta ""meuf""====&gt; ""Absorbe Mes Pensees"" ""Lache Moi"") Il n'y a mais alors aucune profondeur...Pour moi il n'y a rien a retirer de positif sur cet album si ce n'est 3 chansons! ""Chant De Bataille"" ou on a une chanson qui a un sens et qui livre un message...enfin ca c'est surtout grace au rap de Don Choa...pareil pour ""Nous Contre Eux"" merci a Dadoo. Et à la limite ""L'Oeuvre De Dieu"" mais sinon c'est pauvre... Cet album est vraiment pour les fans de Matt...mieux vaut s'écouter Corneille ou Wallen!! Acheter cet album c'est gaspiller son argent...a écouter simplement par curiosité...En tout cas c'est un des pires album que j'ai eu a écouter!"
2,et bien ginu ce laisse aller peu etre du a ca notoriete ou par manque de creativité mais en tous cas cette opus est pas terrible de tous ca manque d'emotion et meme les slow jam sont pas terrible alors je dis que c plutot moyen
5,"Le plus lover des lovers est de retour avec un très belle album peut-être le meilleur. La production des morceaux est superbe,avec sa très belle voix si velouté qui vous transporte je ne sais ou, c'est un vrais régale. A écouté pendant les moment de détente, de tranquillité. A retenir la belle collaboration avec RASCAL FLATTS sur la très belle (RED, WHITE,and BLUE). Tout l'album cartonne acheter le vite..."
4,Un album excellent qui exprime bien le savoir-faire de Björk pour nous captiver et regroupe à la fois sa voix magnifique et ses talents de composition expérimentale.
5,"Je ne suis pas spécialement fan de musique électronique,mais cet album possède le côté introspectif que l'on retrouve habituellement dans le rock (normal quand on sait que Björk a joué dans les Sugarcubes).La beauté polaire et irréelle qui se dégage de ""Joga"" m'a totalement ahuri!En vrac,les quatre premiers morceaux sont absolument géniaux.Quant au reste,c'est un peu plus...claustrophobe,à l'exception de ""Alarm Call"",qui sonne presque comme du Michael Jackson avec choeurs et refrain pop... Vraiment fabuleux."
2,"Mauvaise touche ! C'est 10 étoiles que je voulais cocher !  Comment ai je pu ignorer Devin Townsend ! Cela claque, cela vous vibre au plus profond de chaque cellule ! Quelle sensation de plénitude de jouer cette musique là !  C'est le meilleur son entendu pour moi depuis des années ! On y retrouve tout : créativité, génie, atmosphère, écriture musicale absolue, mélodie, intense et orgasmique !...  L'âme de la musique est en lui. Merci mec !  Terria est né avec cet album...  Je veux être réincarné en Devin Tonswsend !  Cet homme est un devin... Devin a tout compris !"
4,"La précédente tournée américaine de Primus s'appelait ""Tour de Fromage"" est consistait à reprendre cet album en entier, et dans l'ordre, à tous les concerts. Voilà qui en dit long sur la préférence du groupe. Un des meilleurs albums du groupe (vous en serez convaincu après avoir entendu les lives de la tournée). Même si l'on peut parfois penser que les lignes de basse se resemblent souvent, certains morceaux restent tout bonnement saisissants par leur structure inhabituelle ou leur riff hors du commun (""American Life"", ""Jerry"", ou ""Is it Luck ?""). Ce disque contient certains des morceaux les plus reconnus du groupe (""Tommy The Cat"" dont on préferera la version de ""Rhinoplasty"", ""Blue Collars Tweekers"", etc...). Album excellent, en attendant la version remixée (un jour peut être)."
1,"Quelle déception ! Ne connaissant pas ce groupe il y a peu de temps, et beaucoup de monde me l'ayant recommandé, je me récipite sur Coldplay ... Mais malheureusement on est bien loin de la voix de Tom Yorke, bien loin de l'inventivité géniale de Radiohead, bien loin aussi de la voix fantastique de Muse ( j'ai oublié le nom du chanteur - ), et on se perd dans des mélodies vues et revues sans la moindre originalité. Quand à la voix, elle est juste sympathique, pas de quoi insister sur ce point. Je trouve ce groupe presque similaire à Travis, c'est à dire banal comme tout. La pop a du plomb dans l'aile ... A quand un retour de l'originalité ?"
5,"...si ce n'est que cet album est à la hauteur des CRANBERRIES, c'est à dire sublime et géant. Il faut bien entendu l'écouter plusieurs fois afin d'en tomber définitivement amoureux. Bilan de la première écoute : ouahh !!! Dolorès a vraiment une voix extraordinaire servie par des chansons à la hauteur de son talent. A acheter de toute urgence !"
2,"Curieux ça, des gens n'ayant jamais entendu oui dire des Barbarians, We the People, Small Faces, Kinks, Primitives, Sorrows, Pretties (et caetera et vince victus) se ruent comme des dératés qu'ils sont sur ce qu'ils jugent être bon; or, ça ne l'est pas. Saisir la négritude et la primitivité, la rebellion, la haine du rythm'n blues n'est guère donné à tout le monde. Vous me le concéderez bien. Un produit mal foi bien tourné, préférez lui les précédents 33...Seeya."
1,"Le CV de Mlle Auf Der Maur était plutot alléchant : Smashing Pumpkins, Hole, ... Mais à l'écoute ca devient écoeurant. Ecoeurant sur chaque chanson, dont l'attaque prometteuse cède vite la place à du poussif. Et au délà de 10 chansons, ca épuise. Certes, Mlle Auf der Maur joue à merveille de son instrument, et elle le prouve à chaque note. Sauf que si les experts en basses s'extasieront, l'auditeur lambda, lui, trouvera tout ca bien ennuyeux."
5,"Curieuse impression de découvrir cet enregistrement presque quarante ans plus tard...C'est une chance, un cadeau volé au temps ! Grande qualité technique (son irréprochable) et artistique pour ce très beau témoignage du talent de cet artiste marquant, enregistré en janvier 1971 à Toronto. Guitare acoustique et piano accompagnent la voix acidulée de Neil Young. C'est l'occasion de redécouvrir certaines chansons devenues des classiques dans des versions simples et belles. Certaines y gagneraient presque, comme A man needs a maid sans les orchestrations de l'album studio. On découvre aussi en avant-première (mais avec 40 ans de retard, véritable paradoxe temporel) certaines chansons qui figureront sur Harvest un an plus tard, en 1972. Alors nhésitez pas, embarquez pour ce voyage dans le temps."
4,"Je ne suis pas un grand fan de la nouvelle scène metal (neo-metal comme ils l'appellent), parce que je trouve toujours que la copie des originaux (Korn, Deftones, etc.) est assez pâle et trop flagrante. Sur Creed, je n'ai pas eu ce sentiment. Déjà, parce qu'on sent qu'il y a chez eux une maitrise technique d'une autre envergure que chez les autres. De plus, ils possèdent un sens de la mélodie qui a tendance à trop se perdre dans la musique rock velue, ce qui leur permet d'élargir l'auditoire et d'éviter de crier à tout va pour dire des imbécilités.  Côté musical, le guitariste est extraordinaire, il survole le disque du début à la fin, en mixant riffs lourds et arpèges délicates. Il est l'âme du groupe. Plus en avant, les vocalises sont puissantes et bien mises en valeur, même si parfois un peu répétitives. L'équilibre de l'ensemble est quand même très bon. Tout ça pour vous dire que c'est bien. Juste un conseil pour finir, commencez votre découverte de Creed via ce disque là, Human Clay, que je trouve mieux produit que les autres. Si vous appréciez, continuez alors votre voyage. Enfin, si vous connaissiez déjà Creed, partez à la quête d'un titre qui ne figure sur aucun de leurs albums, mais sur une compil de reprises des Doors. Ils ont su faire une reprise de ""Riders on the Storm"" qui vaut le détour : un son rock puissant dans le chef d'oeuvre de Morrison qui ne dénature jamais le titre original, je dis chapeau bas."
1,"Ce soir j'ai parcouru les interventions élogieuses concernant UP et me suis dit que je devrais bien acheter cet album. Mais voilà, ouf, je me rappelle à temps que je l'ai déjà acheté voici 15 jours! Déjà oublié? Non: refoulé!"
1,"Après avoir découvert Genesis en 72 avec Foxtrot, Abacab allait être mon dernier disque acheté du groupe. Après un ""Then they were three"" calamiteux, ""un Duke"" très limite, ""Abacab"" dépassait ce à quoi l'on pouvait s'attendre de pire. Cette fois, c'est définitif, Collins a pris les commandes du groupe et impose ses choix douteux. La musique proposée par cette album n'a strictement plus rien à voir avec le glorieux passé du groupe : il s'agit de pop matinée de variété sans aucune ambition. Si ce n'est l'ambition pour Collins de développer sa carrière solo et de producteur bien plus lucrative et qui l'amenera de nombreuses années plus tard dans de prestigieuses émission style staracadémie... Totalement désolant."
5,"Arrêtez par pitié sans arrêt de comparer Waters aux Floyd et de regretter Gilmour... ECOUTEZ cet album avec une oreille neuve ( si vous pouvez !!!) Vous entendrez les chansons ecrites et composées par Waters parfois totalement réarrangées (WYWH), découvrirez son univers solo noir mais d'une beauté sans nom où, comme depuis toujours se mêle le lyrisme et le rock... C'est absolument un CHEF D'OEUVRE !!!! Je regrette presque que ce type ait été le co-créateur, parolier et compositeur de la majeure partie du Floyd pour que on arrête de regarder derière et de regretter le son de la guitare d'un tel, le sourire de l'autre où je ne sais quoi !!! Ecoutez le pour ce qu'il a toujours été et ce qu'il est : un génie !!!"
5,"there's no way...y'a pas le choix, ce sera""the wall ou the pros and cons of hitch hiking""dixit Roger Waters aux autres membres en cette année 1978. Sous la coupe de Dr Megalo, les 3 comparses s'écrasent, le gentil Rick Wright sera bientôt viré(après la tournée The Wall); alors David le Bellâtre, ex-mannequin et amant de BB(parait-il), transforme les ""essais"" marqués avec Echoes, one of these days, time, shine on you, pigs, sheep et le prouve si besoin l'est: un très très grand guitariste, qui sait exister et composer seul(isn't it Dr W.?) et prendre des risques...Le gentil Rick va suivre le même rêve moite(Wet dream)..."
2,"la réponse est non. j'ai eu beau l'écouter régulièrement, lui donner sa chance une bonne trentaine de fois... mais je suis au regret de vous dire que cet album est décevant. voici tout de même un petit aperçu de ce qui vous attend si vous voulez acquérir ce 'ringleader' : 'life is pigsty', (le morceau le plus important de cet album aux dires de certains), fait penser musicalement à du massive attack (période blue lines), avec ses bruits de verres en guise de percussion et son synthé atmosphérique. voilà pour l'ambiance. la mélodie n'est malheureusement pas très inspirée. le single 'you've killed me' est lui aussi assez bancal, avec son côté putassier rentre dedans. 'in the future where all's well' lorgne du côté de l'album your arsenal avec ses guitares basiques sauf que le titre reste très indigent du point de vue mélodique. même remarque pour 'on the streets' où on atteint un summum de vacuité. 'at last I am born' fonctionne assez bien avec son intro et son atmosphère à la ennio morricone (celui-ci a d'ailleurs participé aux arrangements d'un autre morceau de l'album 'dear god'). là où le bât blesse en fait ici, c'est du côté de la production signé visconti. le tout sonne trop pompeux et surtout, les mélodies ne sont malheureusement pas lumineuses. on cherche à retrouver sur cet album le niveau d'une B-side de cd-single de 2004 comme l'excellente 'my life is a succession of people saying good bye'. en vain."
1,"Autant le premier album paru sous le nom du groupe était fantastique, autant celui-ci reste souvent au raz des paquerettes. Après un remaniement presque complet du groupe, la chanteuse a changé et le rappeur n'est plus là. Les compositeurs semblent en panne d'inspiration, puisque la plupart des chansons étant assez ennuyeuses et quelconques. La douce ambiance enjôleuse du premier album a disparu;, à la place: des morceaux langoureux plus proches de la variété que du trip-hop. Deux morceaux méritent tout de même une attention particulière: ""Take my head"" et ""You make me feel"", bien ficelés qui  prouvent que tout n'est pas perdu."
5,"Dans la foultitude de compil estampillées ""new wave"" qui sortent depuis quelques temps, en voici une parfaitement recommandable et à tout petit prix...  Hormis les ""calibres"" de l'époque (Al Corley, Tears for fears...),on notera la présence d'autre titres moins connus et non moins excellents : le grandiose ""Wot"" de Captain Sensible et en final sur le CD le classique ""Eileen"" des Dexy'sMN (non, ce n'est pas The Cure comme on le croit souvent!!)...  Du très bon donc, et à petit prix ..."
4,"Malgré le départ du guitariste (torturé) Graham Coxon, Think Tank reste dans la continuité de ""Blur"" et de ""13"". Des morceaux pas si faciles d'accès, parfois un peu longuets, remplis d'arrangements incongrus, de sons différents. Au bout de deux ou trois écoutes, ils deviennent plaisants, beaux, émouvants ou drôles. Entre un premier titre envoûtant et un dernier magnifique, Think Tank aligne chansons douces, funk endormi ou encore du Pavement. Au milieu de la morosité musicale ambiante, ce ""laboratoire à penser"" est très bien venu. Et si vous remontez la plage 1 sur votre lecteur, un morceau caché de près de 7 minutes et qui sonne comme un hommage aux Specials allonge encore le plaisir..."
5,"À vos mouchoirs ! La puissance instrumentale vous fera pleurer, parce que c'est trop beau, trop exquis, trop puissant. La première écoute vous cloue au sol, on ne peut bouger, on attend la catastrophe, comme un médium qui saurait que c'est inévitable. Crescendo fou, puissance de deux batteries, neuf membres et un son mélancolique à souhait. Avec violon, violencelle. Deux chansons. À peine 30 minutes, mais tellement de puissance qu'on a l'impression que cet oeuvre est un infini, qu'elle tourne et se boucle. À écouter à répétition, malgré les souffrances."
5,"C'est vraiment le meilleur album de ce groupe simplement connu pour ce qu'il a sorti il y a quelques années. Avec Black Sunday, c'est un retour aux sources."
4,"Plein d'âme... Ce premier Album du leader de New Model Army est un coup de maître... moins de coups de gueules, en tout cas en apparence, mais une rage dissimulée et une profonde maitrise de sa voix et des instrumentations (parfois suprenantes...)"
1,"Fan de duran duran, simple minds et autres foncez acheter ce cd de pop anglaise insipide...Je me souviens d'un grand groupe de rock progressif qui portait le meme nom Marillion dans les années 90...avec un grand chanteur compositeur...Et d'énormes albums conceptuels et progressifs....Moi je serai eux je porterais plainte contre celui çi...quel scandale !!! Osez utiliser le meme nom pour faire ça...."
2,"Eh bien, 3 écoutes ne m'ont pas convaincu. Ce n'est pas assez, je sais bien, un album d'Interpol se savoure sur la durée mais il y a quelque chose de cassé, est-ce la production de Rich Costey, trop lisse (pourquoi avoir quitté le fantastique Peter Katis ?), ou est-ce cette lassitude à entendre toujours les mêmes motifs mélodiques, et ces arpèges de guitares moins inspirés ? Lassant, voilà le mot. Oh bien sûr, individuellement, les gars restent des as dans leurs disciplines respectives, tout ça sonne carré, pro, puissant. Mais la flamme de ""Turn on the bright lights"", encore brillante sur ""Antics"", semble éteinte cette fois. La pochette est magnifique, c'est déjà ça..."
2,un album tel que Tilt de scott walker défit l'entendement. un mélange de musique de chambre avec les infra-basses de trent reznor. comment un crooner brelien en vient à sortir un album sous haute influence d'Alan vega?? Christophe cherche toujours.
5,"Tout d'abord, il s'agit d'enregistrements totalement inédits; et leur qualité sonore est exceptionnelle. De John Coltrane avec Monk en concert, nous ne disposions que d'un témoignage de médiocre qualité sonore : ""Live at the five spot"" mais qui constituait néanmoins un document historique et incontournable. Quelle différence avec ce ""At the Carnegie hall"" qui sonne de manière incroyable. A peine reçu (merci Amazon), j'ai mis le disque dans le lecteur, pensant que le son allait être juste acceptable. Quelle claque! Le label ""Blue note"" nous offre un cadeau rare et superbe. Il s'agit, ici, des deux concerts donnés le 29 novembre 1957 (le second est incomplet)avec une rythmique constituée de Ahmed Abdul-Malik (contrebasse) et de Shadow Wilson (batterie).  Près d'une heure de bonheur absolu durant laquelle le quartet enchaîne des thèmes classiques de Thelonious ( à l'exception de ""Sweet and lovely"") dans des versions courtes, durées obligées compte tenu de l'affiche de cette journée (se produisaient : Billie Holiday, Dizzy Gillespie en big band, Ray Charles, Chet Baker et Sonny Rollins). Première constatation (indépendament de la très bonne surprise concernant la qualité de restitution) : Monk accompagne presque toujours Coltrane pendant ses soli. On sait à quel point un Miles Davis, complètement perturbé, répugnait à ce que Monk jouât derrière lui au point de lui demander de s'abstenir (""The man I love"" qui, d'autre part, fit ENTENDRE le fameux silence de Monk au cours de son propre solo -point hautement critique de la séance du 24 décembre 1954). Coltrane n'est nullement gêné par le jeu de Thelonious, bien au contraire il s'appuie dessus comme rarement d'autres musiciens ont su le faire, et prend son envol, dynamisé. La liberté rythmique et harmonique du pianiste se pressent comme le champ ouvert à celle de Coltrane. En ""Evidence"", la démonstration en est parfaite; Monk ponctuant, rappelant, relançant le chant du saxophoniste. Mais Monk sait aussi ne pas s'imposer lorsqu'il estime que cela n'est pas nécessaire et pour ""Nutty"", il laisse Coltrane développer son solo seul (1:42 à 2:24) jusqu'à ce que ce dernier revienne en un phrase évocant le thème. ""Blue Monk"", encore, donne à entendre le piano jouer les ponctuations, affirmant toute la riche syntaxe de la musique monkienne dans laquelle le silence résonne (raisonne) véritablement non comme la contradiction de la musique mais comme un de ses éléments fondateurs et fondamentaux. Ce disque, magique, grandiose, est indispensable et pas seulement pour les admirateurs de Trane ou de Monk. Il s'agit d'un moment historique du jazz, d'un de ces moments qui marquent définitivement sa vivacité, son éternelle avancée. Enregistré à l'origine pour une retransmission radiophonique, les bandes semblaient perdues. Un immense merci à Larry Applelbaum qui a découvert une boite qui portait l'inscription manuscrite ""T.Monk"", a écouté la bande et reconnu à la fois Thelonious Monk et John Coltrane. La ""Library of congress"" estime détenir quelques 2,5 million d'enregistrements radio dans tous les formats possibles. De quoi rêver, n'est-ce pas?!"
5,"Quel que soit le contexte, John Coltrane reste fidèle à lui-même et à la très haute idée de son art. Ce magnifique disque, avec ""Ballads"" et ""With Johnny Hartman"", s'inscrit dans cette sorte de trilogie qu'Impulse et Bob Thiele, producteur, avait demandé à Coltrane d'enregistrer afin de gagner les critiques qui l'éreintaient alors. Enregistrés le 26 septembre 1962 (le même jour d'ailleurs que la plupart des titres de ""Ballads""!) les 7 titres qui composent cet album n'ont donné lieu qu'à une seule et unique prise (aucune prise rejetée ou perdue, ce qui est presque historique dans les sessions de Coltrane). Il est vrai que Thiele avait mis en garde Ellington du perfectionnisme de John et que le Duke anticipait en déclarant après chaque morceau : ""c'est la bonne, on la garde""! Connaissant le caractère humble et respectueux de Coltrane on ne s'étonnera pas qu'il se soit rangé à l'avis d'Ellington. De la même façon que dans ""Ballads"" Coltrane s'était approprié et avait transcendé des thèmes tièdes, pour ne pas dire insipides, son jeu et ses interprétations forcent l'admiration tant ils élèvent la musique. Hodges, lui-même, concèdera que l'interprétation de Coltrane dans ""In a sentimental mood"" était la plus belle de toute. Pas de choc de générations ou de culture jazzistique ici, pas plus que de personnalités : Coltrane joue ce qu'il porte en lui avec ce don totale de lui-même, cette immense générosité et ce respect total des musiciens qui le caractérisaient. Une rencontre magique."
5,"La critique Monsieur Schlosser montre encore une fois le racisme de la ""jazz police"" envers la musique latine. Selon lui Kenny Barron aurai sacrifié à la mode. Comme si Kenny Barron aurait besoin de ça. Grand connaisseur de la musique latine, il avait dedié il y a beaucoup d'anées un disque indispensable à la musique brésilienne ""Sambao"" mais avec seulement des compositions originales. Ses anées avec Dizzy, grand maìtre et defensseur de la musique latine , auraient peût-être contribué. Mais il suffit de ecouter son ""Softly as in amorning sunrise"" de son disque ""Freefall"" en duo avec la violiniste Regina Carter pour savoir que Kenny Barron est un grand du latin jazz."
1,"Sur la pochette, une étiquette nous indique que c'est le nouvel album studio de Loreena. C'est un pur mensonge marketing. En fait la moitié des morceaux existent déjà sur d'autres albums. A EVITER...."
1,"Quelle horreur! Bon amateur des Stooges, j'écoute régulièrement leurs deux très bons premiers albums. Celui-ci je n'ai par contre jamais pu dépasser la deuxième chanson, c'est tout bonnement inécoutable, tout à fond, zéro dynamique. Le pire cd au niveau mastering ? J'en ai l'impression, c'est en tout cas pire que ""Death Magnetic"" (Metallica) c'est dire! Malgré ces années d'expérience en musique, Iggy est manifestement un très, très mauvais technicien du son qui doit ignorer la différence entre saturation analogique et digitale. Quant à moi j'attends toujours de pouvoir réellement découvrir cet album qu'on présente souvent comme le meilleur des 3. Jusqu'ici je n'ai ni trouvé le vinyl, ni même l'édition cd reprenant le mastering original. Pour info, voici au moins une référence d'une édition CD faite avec le mix de David Bowie : Columbia CK 32111."
1,"Attention, ce n'est pas un album rock. je suis très déçu par bertignac. Voilà maintenant qu'il nous fait de la variété et de la pop insipide. Reste le dvd des concerts antérieurs pour nous faire oublier cet album."
5,"Comment resister à la poésie de Léonard Cohen? Comment resister à la profondeur de cet album qui, tel le premier titre ""avalanche"" ramasse tout sur son passage? Il faut avoir écouté au moins une fois ""songs of Love and hate"" pour apprécier à sa juste valeur l'immense talent de Cohen. Sa voix grave et sombre, ses chants si profonds, l'amour et la haine qu'il s'en dégage. Cet album est incontournable. Achetez le, et votre vie changera."
5,"On tient sans doute dans ce disque l'opus le plus abouti et le plus cohérent de la seconde partie de la carrière du poète canadien. Trouvant son unité dans l'usage systématique de nappes de synthétiseurs et de choeurs féminins se mariant harmonieusement à la voix grave du chanteur, l'album alterne ballades magnifiques et protest-songs des mieux senties, climats pince-sans-rire ou très va-t-en-guerre, le tout baigné par l'ironie et le pessimisme cinglants d'un Cohen au mieux de sa forme, signant là parmi ses meilleurs textes et ses meilleures mélodies. A ce niveau de maitrise, on atteint une sorte d'idéal abstrait (mais combien sensuel), comme une idée de la chanson pure. En fin de parcours, le barde se paie d'ailleurs le luxe de rappeler qu'il est un des seuls song-writers actuels à tutoyer l'éternité, en se fendant d'un Tower Of Song impeccable, aussi désarmant de drolerie que de noirceur, et ne faisant allégeance à un âge d'or mythique que pour mieux saluer l'avenir. C'est parfait."
5,"l y a des musiciens qui traversent -inexplicablement-mal des frontières aussi ténues que la Manche ou les Alpes. Il y a 20 ans, le groupe Talk Talk marchait partout en Europe sauf au Royaume-Uni, son pays natal... Pour Paul Weller, créateur des ""Jam"" ou de ""Style Council"", c'est l'inverse... J'ai toujours aimé les Jam, beaucoup apprécié certains titres de Style Council et tenté de percer à jour pourquoi la carrière solo de Paul Weller m'était plus hermétique... C'était jusqu'à ""22 dreams"", son disque de 2008, que j'écoute en boucle depuis plusieurs semaines... La principale surprise (qui n'en est plus une quand on repense au titre de l'album) est l'absence de silence entre les chansons. Du coup, on gllisse de l'une à l'autre comme dans sun rêve. Mélange de folk (sûrement une réminiscence du projet ""The imagined village"" auquel Weller a collaboré), de pop (Noël Gallager est là...) de rocks et de chansons, le disque est un mélange hétéroclite que relie intellectuellement le texte de la pochette (quatre pages écrites par l'alter ego imaginaire de Paul Weller. Du coup, on se croirait presque dans ""The lamb lies down on Broadway""...) Rarement disque récent m'aura paru à la fois aussi sophistiqué et facile d'accès. La pop est parfois mystérieuse... Il souffle sur ce disque un sentiment de liberté dont je savais Weller capable mais parfois un peu avare. En écoutant les 22 chansons, on ressent une impression de ""déjà entendu"" (au sens sensoriel et onirique du terme) renforcé par l'extraordinaire prise de son. La voix de Paul Weller est très modulée, changeante. Une réussite. Un concept-album qui ne conceptualise pas, qui s'effeuille comme une des plantes de la pochette. Et puis au milieu une perle incroyable : ""Song for Alice"". Un instrumental fascinant, appuyé par la trompette et le piano de Robert Wyatt. Ne serait-ce que pour ce titre, l'album vaut d'être écouté, Il en est le parfais Sésame... Pierre GAFFIÉ (www.different.fr)"
5,"Derrière ce nom, a priori amusant, se cache de jeunes musiciens qui se sont rencontrés à peu près par hasard dans une université à Los Angeles, et qui s'entendent tellement bien lorsqu'ils jouent ensemble qu'ils décident de monter un groupe de rock. Finalement l'album Toto, à bien y regarder, ce n'est pas que du rock. Oui, c'est du rock (""Child's Anthem"" bref instrumental mais tellement intense, ""Hold The Line"" mythique et signature du groupe pour l'éternité, ""Rockmaker""), mais c'est aussi du rythm'n blues (""Georgy Porgy"" magique, repris et décliné un nombre incalculable de fois), de la ballade (""Angela"" trop rarement joué), du disco (""Manuela Run"", ""I'll Supply The Love"") et du rock très rock (""Girl Goodbye""). Du son révolutionnaire pour l'époque, aucun morceau n'est à zapper sur son lecteur. La production est parfaite. C'est vraiment l'un des meilleurs albums de Toto."
5,"Attention, arrêtez tout, laissez cramer le steak, déborder le bain, brailler la marmaille, sonner le facteur (pas d'inquiétude, il re sonnera...), la seule urgence du moment est de vous procurer cet enregistrement de Peter Green HOT FOOT POWDER, reprenant des chansons de Robert Johnson.  Peter Green, après avoir gratté chez les Bluesbreaker de John Mayall, fonde Fleetwood Mac en 1967 - la première formation, celle qui jouait du blues sous acide, pas la seconde mouture Rock FM. Sa sensibilité, sa peur de la notoriété, et ses addictions diverses, mettent à mal sa santé, et Peter Green se retire de la musique, pour fréquenter les hôpitaux psychiatriques.  Robert Johnson (1911 - 1938) le plus célèbre des pères fondateurs du Delta blues, auteur à lui tout seul de 50% du répertoire blues et dont on disait qu'il pactisât avec le diable pour jouer aussi bien de la guitare... Il est mort empoisonné par un mari jaloux, ou de la syphilis, c'est selon... L'intégrale Robert Johnson tient sur un album, ne vous en privez pas.  En 1998, Peter Green s'empare une première fois du répertoire de Johnson, avec ROBERT JOHNSON SONGBOOK, et fort de ce succès, remet ça deux ans plus tard avec d'autres titres, sur ce HOT FOOT POWDER. Le résultat est tout bonnement fantastique. Du blues pur et dur, tantôt acoustique ou électrique, mais sans aucune esbroufe, à la cool, du soft blues, avec un son live et dépouillé qui rend hommage aux originaux, tout en étant contemporain. Peter Green s'est entouré de quelques invités, parmi les lesquels Buddy Guy, Dr John, Otis Rush, Joe Louis Walker... N'en jetez plus ! La voix de Peter Green est douce, veloutée, et peut rappeler Eric Clapton sur certains morceaux comme « Malted Milk » d'ailleurs repris par Clapton sur son UNPLUGGED. « Drunken hearted man » a été repris par The Allman's Brother sur leur LIVE AT FILLMORE, et « Crossroad » reste un des plus grands classiques du genre (avec « Stormy Monday » de T Bone Walker).    Treize titres pour 42 minutes, c'est court, mais c'est sublime.  Une anecdote blues ? J'ai entendu récemment « Sweet home Chicago » chanté par Robert Jonson, et dont les paroles sont différentes de la célèbre version des Blues Brothers. Johnson chante : « Come on, baby don't you wanna go, to the land of California, Sweet home Chicago ». Johnson, qui n'a jamais quitté ou presque son Mississippi, rêve à la fois de la dorée Californie, et de la ville de Chicago déjà célèbre pour ses clubs de musique. Mais la géographie n'étant pas son fort, il associe les deux dans son texte. Les artistes qui reprennent sa chanson aujourd'hui, corrige cette (jolie) erreur, en chantant ""down to the same old place, my sweet home, Chicago""...     Vous pouvez recommencer à respirer. LE DISQUE VENDU PAR AMAZON PRESENTE L'INTEGRALE PETER GREEN/ROBERT JOHNSON. MON COMMENTAIRE PORTE SUR LES 13 PREMIERS TITRES."
2,"Le jazz-rock, c'est pas mon truc. Mais comme j'avais apprécié « Heavy Weather », le prédécesseur de ce « Mr. Gone », j'ai retenté l'expérience Weather Report. Ce « Mr. Gone » ne me « concerne » pas vraiment. Trop travaillé, trop élaboré, trop sophistiqué pour mes oreilles nouvelles dans ce domaine. Heureusement le format court des titres donne un rythme varié à l'ensemble et aide à mieux digérer cette chantilly musicale. Techniquement impressionnant (sauf celui qui s'essaye à chanter sur le dernier titre), mais peu chargé en « vie », en émotions. Beau mais froid. Les qualités novatrices sont indéniables, avec des synthés omniprésents. Qui ont dû donner plein d'idées à plein d'Anglais du début des années 80. Et Sting a dû écouter « The poursuit of the woman ... » avant d' écrire le morceau de Police « Regatta de Blancs » sur le Cd du même nom. « Mr. Gone » n'est pas forcément désagréable, mais il ne va pas tourner en boucle sur la platine Cd chez moi."
5,"Alain Caron est un bassiste exceptionnel. Cet album est digne de figurer dans la nouvelle vague du jazz-rock. Tous les ingredients sont là: groove, jazz, funk, subtilité...que demander de plus... Alain Caron se ballade sur des thèmes extra avec sa basse 6 cordes, quelle maîtrise du slap, du rhytme...accompagné par de supers musiciens, on ne peut qu'admirer son oeuvre. Je conseille vivement cet album à toute personne aimant la musique de qualité."
2,"Le ver est dans le fruit depuis déjà quelques temps - malgré les excellents Chinatown et Renegade- et Phil Lynott a remplacé l'étincellant Snowy White par John Sykes. Mal lui en a pris car cet album est sans aucun doute le moins bon de la discographie de Lizzy.  Son trop lourd, production sans originalité mais dans l'air du temps de l'époque. Erreur de jugement.  John Sykes prend sa guitare pour une tronçonneuse, dommage...  Ses prédecesseurs Brian Robertson -fabuleux sur Jailbreak et live and dangerous-, Snowy White -excellent sur Chinatown et Renegade-, Gary Moore -magnifique Black Rose- &amp; Eric Bell -The Rocker- distillaient une musique mélodieuse et racée où les guitares tissaient de magnifiques harmonies. Ici, seule une moitié d'album est convaincante: le superbe ""Bad habits"", ""This is the one"", la ballade ""The sun goes down"" , et l'engagé ""Holy war"". Phil Lynott n'était pas dans sa meilleure période -pour preuve l'horrible Gran Slam- mais les combats épiques d'Emerald et de Black Rose demeureront comme des sommets du Rock irlandais."
5,Dommage que ce groupe reste inconnu en France car c'est vraiment un tres bon groupe. C'est une tres bonne compil et un excellent live.
4,"La première écoute fait l'effet d'une ''rocket'' ! Moscow Underground ouvre l'album dans une atmosphère incroyablement accrocheuse, les sons sont détonnants et l'ambiance évoque automatiquement ce qui a fait le succès du précédent album Black &amp; White 050505. Rockets, Stars Will The Lead The way, Light Travels s'affirment comme les 3 autres maîtres pièces de cet album, avec un niveau musical extraordinairement bon. On est pas loin de U2 par moments et Kerr n'a jamais cessé de rappeler Bono par sa voix...  Si Graffiti Soul ne présente aucune faiblesse musicalement à mon humble avis, je déplore cependant la présence d'une neuvième véritable piste (l'album ne dépassant pas 40 minutes) et le placement légèrement maladroit des meilleurs musiques en début d'album pour une deuxième partie légèrement moins emportée. Kiss and fly laisse quand même passer un second souffle épique et Blood Type 0 se démarque par son originalité et des sons quelques peu innatendus, rendant l'oeuvre toujours plus riche . Pas de quoi en faire un plat, donc. Un très bon album en somme qui prouve la capacité des Minds à conférer, 3 décennies après le début, fraîcheur et modernité à leurs titres, parfois si formidables. Comme guidé par l'éclairage de leur propre ombre, Kerr et sa bande trouvent encore le chemin et c'est avec brio. Bravo."
2,"Quelques mots de plus sur cet album, car entre l'article du site qui descend l'album et le commentaire-client qui l'encense, quel milieu..?"
5,"Tout simplement le meilleur CD que j'ai entendu depuis au moins 5 ans ! Les textes sont enormes, melange de realisme et d'humour. Les musiques sont vraiment excellentes egalement... Ceux qui ont traine un peu dans les rues depuis le milieux des annees 90 apprecieront Djembe Man. Personnellement, j'adore ""Mon pere etait tellement de gauche"" et ""Les dictateurs""."
5,"Le premier album solo de la voix magique de VAS. Azama Ali y mélange subtilement toutes ses influences médiévales, orientales... Le résultat est à couper le souffle. A écouter d'urgence."
4,"Ils viennent de Lyon, ils sont 5, ils font du Dub et ils le font vraiment bien.  Pourtant le Dub français se portait bien mal ces derniers temps, oui mais il y a la ville de Lyon qui nous sauve de ce silence... Lyon, ville bien froide quand-même, oui mais ces cinq gones savent nous en faire tourner quelques bon petits. Et c'est encore dans pas mal d'inluence que le quintet s'est plongé pour faire cet album. Voyez plutôt, Ragga ( heureusement !!), Hip-Hop (bien sûr), World music , une touche de Drum &amp; Bass, et un dernier petit soupçon d'électro barrée. Voilà un résultat des plus alléchant, surtout quand on connait leur prestations Live qui ma foi, vallent vraiment le coup. Tiens tant qu'on parle de Lyon, faite un tour du côté du ""Peuple de l'Herbe"", c'est pas mal non plus..."
1,"pas de disque plus surévalué que celui-ci,,,,, pour moi c'est de la musique d'ascenseur et encore à condition de ne pas monter dans une tour trop haute sinon on risque la gerbe ! Veuillez, je vous prie, écouter plutôt le grand Petrucciani ou Joachim Kühn ou Mc Coy Tiner ou... il en manque pas d'autres........"
2,"Je ne comprends pas l'engouement suscité par cet album. En effet, celui-ci est très mou et donne une irrésistible envie de dormir. Aucune energie, des compos qui sonnent ""déjà vu"" et des paroles plutôt niaises. On dirait un peu Radiohead la tête coincée dans une bouche d'égoût. Il n'y a pas ici de renouveau, de claque à prendre. Ca se laisse écouter sans grand effet, en discutant avec des amis et en mangeant des cacahuètes. Pas digne d'un grand album, ni même de quoi que ce soit de remarquable."
4,"Attention : ce commentaire concerne l'album 'B' même s'il apparaît également sur la page de l'album 'A' ce jour. Turzi est le groupe de Romain Turzi et ses quatre comparses. 'B' est leur deuxième album, après   en 2007. Devrait suivre 'C' dans le cadre d'une trilogie. Turzi compose une musique rock psychédélique avec de l'électronique, aux accents cosmiques, inspirée notamment par le rock allemand. Elle rappelle aussi par moments des groupes plus récents : Death in Vegas et Primal scream. D'ailleurs, Bobby Gillespie (leader de Primal scream) est invité sur un morceau ('Baltimore'). Brigitte Fontaine est également présente sur le long et atypique dernier morceau ('Bamako') dans lequel elle injecte de la poésie comme elle sait le faire parfois. À l'écoute de deux morceaux, on pense aussi à Jean-Michel Jarre (c'est saisissant sur 'Brasilia'). Eh oui, c'est de saison, puisque Étienne Jaumet l'évoque immanquablement sur son album   sorti le même mois. Par moments, la musique de Turzi se déchaîne, rappelant l'exubérance et l'imprévisibilité dont peut faire preuve Joakim (sur 'Bangkok' en particulier). Plus anecdotique, le chant (plus précisément l'élocution, le débit) sur 'Baden Baden' ressemble à celui de 3D de Massive attack (sur l'album 'Mezzanine' surtout). Le premier album de Turzi avait été très remarqué et figurait également parmi mes albums préférés de l'année 2007 (cf. le bon commentaire de Guinea Pig à la page de l'album  ). Après une première écoute qui n'a pas suscité l'enthousiasme, j'ai adopté cet album que j'avais désormais envie d'écouter en boucle : le psychédélisme fait son effet ! Encore une fois parmi mes albums préférés de l'année."
5,"""Octagonecologist"" est le meilleur album de Kool Keith, bien aidé par les scratchs magiks de Q-Bert et les super-prod de Automator.Du hip-hop experimental comme on en entend rarement avec une mention special au morceau ""Blue Flowers"".Indispensable aux fans de Hip-Hop."
5,du classique revu et corrigé par Satie. Il se moquait gentiment des gens qui prenait le classique pour de la GRANDE musique. Des petits thèmes que l'on garde dans la tête
5,"Plongez dans l'abîme de Portishead... Envoûtant, ténébreux, planant, crispant, flippant et merveilleux. Un excellent retour. Certe pas trop accessible au départ mais obliger d'aimer si (surtout) on a aimé le second opus. Je le conseille."
5,"Une des plus agréables surprises de ce début d'année, la voix envoutante d'Isobel Campbell alliée à la rugosité - régime cigarettes et whisky - de Mark Lanegan donnant un album de chansons calfeutrées entre les genre pop, folk et country. Du magnifique ""Deus Ibi Est"" au voyageur ""The circus is leaving town"" en passant par la solitude de ""False husband"" et la version SM du ""Ramblin' Man"" de Hank Williams, on se complait dans une antre mélancolique du meilleur effet sans jamais voir les précieuses minutes passer."
1,"Rien de transcendant chez Tryo, si ce n'est l'agacement que le groupe procure à l'écoute. Si les membres restent dans l'absolu de bons musiciens, le résultat n'en démeure pas moins mauvais. Sur un fond musical dépouillé, rythmiquement enjoué mais pathétiquement réberbatif, le groupe tisse des textes aux idées pseudo-révolutionnaires et engagées mais atrocement ridicules voire démagogiques. On cherche encore un intérêt à découvrir ce groupe..."
1,Et c'est ici que l'histoire de la musique trébucha réellement... Je n'ai pas besoin d'en dire plus !
1,"Désolant, encore un cd qui va finir au placard d'ici 15 jours. Manque de créativité, déjà entendu, rien de vibrant, je suis à peine déçu car je n'en attendais pas beaucoup mieux. C'est fou ce que la pub peut nous faire acheter n'importe quoi. Je considère ce cd comme une denrée rapidement pérrissable. promis je ne me ferais plus avoir !!!!"
5,"du debut a la fin c'est un amour d'album.pour ceux qui aiment les rythmes rapides:all night long est un morceau genial!! le reste de l'album est plus lent ,et sa voix sublime!!! a quand le prochain???"
5,Assia a beaucoup de talent et un style bien à elle et nous le prouve dans ce splendide album.
1,"Sans critiquer les qualités intrinsèques de la diva et des musiciens, ce disque est injustement gâché par un mixage à la Frédéric François, Stone &amp; Charden, Sheila et Ringo ... Bref LE mixage ""Ma voix et le reste derrière"" de nos ingénieurs du son des années variétoche 70's. Au bout d'un moment, ça gave et on propose le CD dans les colonnes ""occasion"" de Amazon à 3.90 euros (c'est le prix de ce type de mixage en supermarché). INSUPPORTABLE !"
1,"Si on permet que ce genre de musique cartonne, j'ai peur pour l'avenir de la production. Achetez les classiques de grands artistes et n'encouragez pas ce type de coup commercial... Pour moi c'est ZERO etoile !"
5,"je ne suis pas un adepte des comparaisons ! Mais on la compare souvent à Jon Mitchell, et c'est vrai une TRES TRES GRANDE artiste de cette nouvelle génération qui confirme qu'avec des choses simples on peux faire des choses EXTRAORDINAIRES. simple par son orchestration, cet album est tout simplement sublime comme l'ensemble de ses albums ! Il faut tous les possédez ! Vous ne vous tromperez pas en l'achetant et vous ne serez en aucun cas décus"
2,"La vie de commentateur  « amazoniaque » est décidément bien  ingrate...figurez vous que l'autre jour , j'avais un commentaire mais pas de titre, et bien cette fois j'ai un titre mais pas de commentaire ! Je laisserai donc la note exprimer mon point de vue sur cet album. En deux mots quand même , c'est vrai que ce concept de jazz mixé avec de l'electro, on se dit pourquoi pas et on jette une oreille pour la curiosité mais rapidement cela devient lassant puis insupportable. L'amateur de jazz fuira à toute jambe ; quant aux amateurs d'electro...on ne peut jurer de rien avec eux.."
1,"Tripping point est vraiment le plus mauvais album des roots pour ne pas dire le plus mauvais album de hip hop ricain de ces derniers mois... En effet, on ne retrouve plus du tout leur originalité et subtilité musicale qui ont fait leur renommée (groove et harmony jazzy bien soignés). On a droit en échange à des instrus basiques et commerciales, des pauvres refrains chantés formatés radio, un blackthough peu original, une pauvre dizaine de titre vite expédiée... bref une grosse déception."
1,"Kanye West sera (c'est sa maison de disques qui l'a décidé) le prochain roi du rap, de la pop, de la soul, ... de tout ce que voulez. Il y a dans ce Cd des samples, voire des passages entiers de chansons de Ray Charles, Curtis Mayfield, Shirley Bassey, Otis Redding, ... enfouis dans dans un brouet sonore calibré pour passer en boucle sur MTV Base... Les connaisseurs ( ? ) disent que Kanye West a une super voix.  Florent Pagny et Pavarotti aussi. C'est pas une raison pour les écouter ..."
1,Cette album n'est vraiment pas bien il ne contient que des instrumentale de 2 minutes a peine.En espérent que RZA s'en remette vite et qu'il nous face de meilleur album que ça.Acheté plutot l'album No said date de Masta killa qui est largement moin chère.
5,"Plus qu'un simple album de Rock, Avril Lavigne a su imposer son style jeune et pourtant si adulte ! Enchainement de melodies douces, vives, pleines de vies, parfois violentes, parfois romantiques... L'album ne se limite pas uniquement au single 'Complicated', mais aborde plus de styles musicaux, des sonorites a la De palmas, NickelBack, Alanis Morisette, Natalie Umbruglia, Sum 41... vraiment complet et melodique, c'est une pure revelation a mes yeux que je vous conseille grandement d'acheter les yeux fermes et les oreilles ouvertes ;-)"
5,"Ce n'est pas si compliqué, Avril est née pour faire bouger le monde! Même si Avril n'est agée que de 17 ans, elle assure vraiment avec mon premier album, ""Let Go.""  La jeune guitariste/auteur/interprète est déjà numéro 1 aux Etats-Unis avec son single, ""Complicated.""  Le reste de l'album est tout aussi intense avec des rythmes entraînants et des paroles matures. Avec ""My World,"" Avril parle de sa vie dans sa petite ville natale. Avec ""Sk8er Boi,"" elle retrace l'histoire d'amour impossible entre un skater séduisant et une belle danseuse de ballet."
2,"Meme si Avril Lavigne se dit skateuse dans l'ame, et meme si son style se démarque du reste de ses rivales, elle n'en reste pas moins une chanteuse de pop de plus a part entiere. Son plus gros hit complicated est d'ailleurs la preuve que la jeune australienne ne fait absolument pas du vrai rock et va donc finir par se retrouver dans le rang de toutes ses chanteuses qui finissent par chanter et danser pour les gamines..."
1,"Franchement je ne suis pas adepte du buzz k un artiste utilise pour lancer dans la foulée de son propre album son soi-disant groupe. Tout cela sent bon le travail fait à la va vite et les instrus de ce morceaux ont comme un air de déjà entendu (get rich...) bref je n'aimais pas trop le style de 50 cent mais bon là il ne faut pas être devin pour voir que ses potes ""rappers"" n'ont pas de talents...mais bon après les filles adorent 50 parce qu'il est ""beau"" et les newbies (les nouveaux venus dans le hip hop) aimeront ce cd parce qu'il y a Dre et Eminem...ahlala nostalgie..."
4,"A la 1ère écoute ca confirme l impression qu'on a en regardant le cd : c'est du très bon Tupac .Les morceaux sont récents, de son époque Makaveli à base de beaucoup d'Outlawz en featuring (EDI Kastro Young Noble Kadafi Napoleon &amp; Big Syke). Fans de Mr Tupac Amaru SHAKUR à acheter de suite !!!"
1,"J'avoue que je suis paumé avec la musique de Ja Rule. Alors que l'on a eu droit à un excellent premier album, Venni Vetti Vecci, hardcore, violent, brutal et magistral, ses deux albums suivants l'ont vu changer carrement de registre. Melangeant rap hardcore avec R&amp;B sirupeux, Ja Rule nous a livré des excellents titres comme ""Always On Time"" avec la superbe Ashanti. Mais à force de trop abuser de cette mixture, ses morceaux ont fini par devenir faiblards. Pour ce 4eme album, dont le titre était en rapport direct avec la Bible et le Christ, j'esperai que Ja Rule retournerait à un rap plus incisif, plus personnel, plus tourmenté, plus sombre. J'avoue que la pochette, ultra-gothique, m'a instantanément donné envie d'acheter cet opus. Mais dès la première écoute, on peut sentir à quel point sa musique est ramolissante. De ""Thug lovin'"", morceau encore passable grace à la participation de Bobby Brown, jusqu'au ridicule ""Mezmerized"", on se dit que Ja Rule a vraiment formaté son talent pour passer en radio. Il joue carrement les lovers à la Nelly, sans même s'assurer en tant que tel dans ce role. La preuve est qu'il refugie sa soupe derrière un visuel marquant, comme en démontre la pochette de l'album. La preuve aussi que les apparences peuvent être trompeuses."
2,"Sans doute l'un des derniers albums de  Mobb deep chez Loud ,Infamy ne restera pas dans les anales comme les précédents albums du Queens Bridge possee!!!! Cet album est résolument beaucoup plus commercial et ""dancefloor"" que les 4 autres Opus . On y retrouve des productions de Havoc sur l'nsemble des titres et une prod signée The achemist (une seule!!!!)qui reste elle dans la tradition du son noir et angoissant des Mobb Deep! Cet Opus n'est pâs un incontournable!loin de là!!!"
4,"C'est vrai, on se retrouve en terrain connu car cet album n'a pas été pensé pour explorer d'autres voix que ce qui fut engagé avec le Suprême ni coller aux évolutions du rap qui se vend le plus et dont l'ancien compère Joey reste un étonnant exemple. Loin de la FM mais donc toujours inspiré par le bitume et l'odeur des halls, Dernier Round capte d'abord par un son lourd (excellente production) qui fonctionne d'autant mieux que les lyrics indiquent bien, les années passant, que le désarroi accompagne toujours plus le coup de gueule. Les thèmes habituels ('On a enfoncé des portes', 'Oh no'...) s'enrichissent aussi d'une introspection douloureuse et émouvante ('Qui suis-je ?', 'Un ange dans le ciel') qui en rajoute une couche. Même si certains morceaux font bouger ('Le retour du babtou', 'Two shouts...') et que les collaborations (Oxmo, Zoxea...) ajoutent quelques étincelles, l'esprit de l'ensemble est bien résumé par le titre accrocheur 'C'est mal barré'. Si ce Dernier round devait être un chant du cygne, c'est effectivement une réussite. Alors, même si ça plombe l'ambiance, on en redemande !"
4,"Le MC jamaïquain a co-écrit avec le duo de producteurs The Neptunes Feel It Boy, le 1er single extrait de l'album. Il y chante en compagnie de Janet Jackson. L'équation est simple: Beenie Man + Janet Jackson + The Neptunes à la production = tube. Egalement sur cette album des duo avec Lil Kim, Sean Paul, Lady Saw, Righteous Funk, So Solid Crew, Sly &amp; Robbie, Shocking Vibes et Tony ""Cd"" Kelly. En attendant le successeur de Art and Life (1999), voilà de quoi vous mettre l'eau à la bouche…"
5,"Réédition de la sortie de 1996. Voilà un album indispensable à mi chemin entre le 'stunts...' de diamond D, les Show &amp; AG et le 'Foundation' regroupant les sorties maxi du DITC. Car Lord Finesse est l'un des piliers du crew même si Big L, Fat Joe ou Diamond D étaient plus en lumière. Vous retrouverez avec cet album le son typique du bronx du milieu des années 90 : flow posé et instrus sombres et lancinants. Une pure tuerie dont les instrus, meme si moins punchline, n'ont rien à envier aux sorties queensbridge de la meme époque (Mobb Deep, CNN...). Les sons à la mode se démodent avec le temps ce qui n'est pas le cas de ce skeud. OC, KRS 1, Marquee, Akineyele et AG accompagnent LF sur différents titres. Dites vous bien que lorsque vous écoutez les power cypha de Tony Touch (mixtape su laquelle 50 MCs s'enchainent sur les sons NY les plus lourds) et que vous kiffez sans trop savoir d'où vient l'instru, il vient souvent du ditc : show, diamond et... Lord Finesse. Le 'Rare &amp; unreleased' de Lord Finesse est sortit en 2006 et c'est également une énorme tuerie.  Pour ceux qui veulent se replonger dans les classics du début des 90'S, les albums d'une grande partie de ceux qui ont installé les bases sont réédités depuis fin 2006 : EDOG &amp; Bulldogs, KoolGRap &amp; DJ Polo, les Show &amp; AG, Masta Ace, Main Source... C'est le moment de revoir vos fondamentaux."
5,"Que dire qu'il n'ait pas déjà été dit précédemment ? Il s'agit là de l'un des tous meilleurs albums que le hip hop ait connu. Sorti en 1995 (15 ans déjà !), le son n'a pas pris une ride. Les instrus sont sombres et énormes, les lyrics sont assénées sans la moindre retenue par 2 mcs au top de leur forme. Des invités de grande qualité comme Nas, Raekwon ou Ghostface Killah. Certains titres sont entrés au panthéon de la musique rap, alors courrez vite vous procurer ce brûlot et magnifique opus d'un groupe qui depuis est en nette perte de vitesse."
5,"C'est presque une définition de la noirceur, il n'y a qu'à voir le packaging, le noir y est très pur, plus que la nuit. He bien la musique est dans le même esprit. Autant Eye of every storm était orageux, autant là il est question de néant. Et quelle ambiance ! Toujours la même qualité dans la prod, les mélodies sont ingénieuses, la tristesse glaciale, sans échapatoire, du groupe, est au rendez-vous. En somme,  Neurosis nous offrent un peu tout ce qu'ils savent faire dans cet album : certaines chansons sentent l'orage , comme le dernier album, d'autres sont plus tribales dans leurs rythmes, d'autres simplement violentes et tristes. Parfait pour les découvrir, mais aussi parfait pour les conaisseurs, car c'est un très bon Neurosis. Peut-être le coté tribal, qui me rappelle beaucoup Akira Yamaoka, est la ""petite nouveauté"" du CD ?"
5,"Quittant le monde blues-rock de leurs débuts, les rolling stones se mettent en 1967 au goût du jour et sortent cette petite merveille pop. Le disque est dans la parfaite lignée du précédent ""Aftermath"", qui montrait déjà une virée pour les Stones et qui était un savoureux mélange de blues rock et de pop pré-psychédélique. Ici, en plus des deux incontournables ""Let's spend the night together"" et ""ruby tuesday"", on retrouve des petites perles comme ""cool, calm, collected"", avec accompagnement au piano bastringue et solo de kazou; ou ""something happened to me yesterday"" à l'arrangement très inspiré des Kinks. Les Stones ont su prouver qu'ils étaient capable de s'aligner aux extravagances des Beatles. Bravo !!!"
5,"Un album particulièrement intéressant de faces-B.  Si vous avez adoré ""Siamese Dream"", vous devriez aussi rugir de plaisir à l'écoute de ces 14 tout bon morceaux.  C'est évidemment un peu moins consistant ou cohérent que son prédécesseur, mais 5 étoiles néanmoins justifiées.  ""Landslide"" est une petite perle !"
5,"Que dire de ce double live si ce n'est que c'est une vraie merveille. Toute la (chaude) ambiance qui règne lors des concerts de M est admirablement bien rendue. Les versions live des morceaux sont toutes intéressantes et font la part belle l'improvisation et à la participation du public. Un seul regret: l'absence de Gimmick dans ce live... alors j'ai commandé le live aux francofolies pour compenser. Bonne dégustation de ce live, et avec M, on à l'impression d'être en famille."
1,"comment peut on raisonnablement mettre 5 étoiles à ce groupe prétentieux qui n'amène rien de nouveau et qui à coup sûr decevra son public dans 2 ou 3 albums (comme toutes les nouvelles sensations rock qu'on nous présente depuis the strokes).Le rendez vous est pris. En attendant pas de quoi se pâmer devant cet éventails de vieilles ficelles  entendu et réentendu ailleurs en d'autres temps (mais en mieux). Qui ne connait pas le passé, ne peut pas juger le présent. Je leur souhaite bon courage(ils en auront besoin)."
2,"grand fan d'Eric Bibb, j attendais un nouvel opus apres le sublime ""diamond days""; ce live est une fausse nouveauté, transcription cd du live sorti en dvd en 2005.pas de nouveaux morceaux, chant étouffé par la guitare."
5,"What?? Aucune chronique sur le 5e album de FOREIGNER paru en 1984!!!! C'est à la limite de la faute professionnelle de la part des commentateurs d'Amazon! Tout le monde a entendu au moins une fois dans sa vie I want to know what love is avec son refrain repris par une escouade de bambins mystico-je-sais pas quoi... Tooth and nail, le 1er morceau, est un rock pur et dur au riff comme seul Mick Jones a le secret. That was yesterday, titre ondulant a double détente a fait un carton mérité des 2 côtés de l'atlantique. Les 2-3 rock suivants sont anecdotiques, les Foreigners doivent ecrire ce genre de trucs en dormant!... C'est à partir de A love in vain que ça devient diaboliquement intéressant. Les 2 1eres minutes de A love.. sont à se damner, nappe d'orgue, rythmique béton, la VOIX de Lou Gramm qui jongle avec les montées de ton de la gratte de Micky... MON morceau préféré des Etrangers,définitivement! Down on love est un slow martelé encore et toujours par la voix unique de Gramm, souligné par le piano et la guitare inspirés du génial Jones, suivi de l'immense Two different worlds où éclatent tous les talents des membres du groupe! Et ce qui ne gatte rien, j'adore le F de la pochette!"
4,"curieuse idée que celle d'enregistrer des airs révolutionnaires (oh, le chant des partisans)...ou d'autres (le temps des cerises...imagine) et d'en faire du jazz...ne croyez surtout pas que c'est de la musique d'ascenceur... j'étais réticent à acheter ce disque ... et quelle surprise! bravo Giovanni!"
2,"Je comprends tout à fait l'enthousiasme des commentateurs précédents, mais je ne partage pas du tout leur avis dithyrambiques, à l'écoute de ce double ""live"", qui me paraît rempli de défauts... D'abord, je pense qu'un seul disque aurait amplement suffi. Ce concert est beaucoup trop long. Gaspillage. En outre, les trois morceaux ""stride"" ( dont le fameux ""Ain't Misbehavin'"" de Fats Waller) me semblent à côté de la plaque. Jack DeJohnette abuse de la cloche sur la ride, et le son de l'ensemble est mat. Pourtant la longue intro de Jarrett augurait du meilleur. Voilà des musiciens venus jouer pour un public ""satisfait"" de voir leur idole (histoire de dire, ""j'y étais""...) A moins d'être un accro de Jarrett (et pourtant, en tant que fan de Jarrett, je peux dire que ce disque est décevant en comparaison avec d'autres oeuvres antérieures, en trio ou en quartette - que l'on songe au magnifique ""Survivor's Suite""), ce disque ne s'impose pas dans vos achats. il ne s'agit que de la fin d'un trio au bout du rouleau, en manque d'inspiration (c'est flagrant lors de ce concert à Montreux). C'est bien dommage, car ce trio a enregistré des heures de gloire (""Tales of Another"", ""Changes"", ""Still Alive"", ""Bye Bye Blackbird"", ou encore leur concert éblouissant en Norvège, le sublime ""Standards in Norway"".). Désolé, mais à l'heure actuelle, il existe des trios bien plus intéressants (ceux de John Taylor, Fred Hersch, ou encore Bill Carrothers...)"
5,"Plus connu, de nos jours, pour ces musiques de film et pour avoir été le révélateur de la musique cubaine,Ryland Cooder était,dans la première moitié des seventies (à l'instar de Randy Newman et Little Feat avec qui il a joués), un monument de la musique américaine INCONTOURNABLE. Ce cd, le quatrième, vous fera partager ces plaisirs sur des airs mexicains, ragtime, jazz antique, soul, et que sais-je encore...Servi par sa voix chaude, mais surtout par ces prodigieux doigts de fée (guitares électriques, acoustiques, mexicaines, slide, picking, mandoline blues, n'en jetez plus la cour est pleine...), ce cd vous rendra...HEUREUX (et dieu sait que l'époque en a besoin...)"
1,"je suis déçue de ce produit il n'y qu'un seul titre qui me satisfait, je pensais que c'étai un best of avec les meilleurs morceaux"
5,"Justine Time label quebecois s'est fait entremetteur entre David Murray saxophoniste, americain et Guy Konket,chanteur,guadeloupéen pour de la World fusion entre la Jazz et la Gwoka.Twa jou san manjé evoque de la Soul-jazz portée dans les thèmes de Blaxploitation Hugh Ragin à la trompette : de la Be bop jouée par David Murray à la clarinette supportée aux tambours par François landrezeau et Klod Kiavué dans un style dit Latino apport des Iberico-americains à New-York.Ensuite commence cette échange entre la Jazz et la Gwoka (dont les modes sont décrit notamment par le groupe Miyo dans leur thème Kominikasyon au cours leur album Héritage)  Youyou s'insipire la phase de la Gwoka dite Lewoz faite pour le rassemblement des Guadeloupéens.On jou maten est Be bop enclanchée par la phase Lewoz Guy Konket au chant et Santi Debriano à la contrebasse y jouent de la Blues.Onomatopée est proprement guadeloupéen le moment d'inprovisation vocale de bruitage de tambour dite Boulagel chantée pour les veillées mortuaires.Nwel lo est un variation Funk sur une cantine guadeloupénne sur un mode guadeloupéen dit Mendé fait s pour le départ au combat des Noirs en Guadeloupe.Dans l'ensemble Yonn Dé Jazz Funk avec une couleur Blaxploitation est amené par la Lewoz.La pli la est à la fois funky et Toumblack rhytme guadeloupéen pour célébrer un mariage.Moman Colombo appartient au Kaladja rhytme guadeloupéen pour dépeindre la tristesse.Si l'ensemble americain prend le dessus sur son homologue guadeloupéen la décontraction de ce dernier amène l'ouverture de l'autre Guy Konket le noyé repèche la vedette David Murray Inutile semble etre la Gwoka pour sa forme uniquement traditonnelle pourtant,elle reste la seul représentation musicale réelle du Guadeloupéen le reste étant l'entremellement voir l'affirmation de la musique des autres.Essentielle semble etre pour sa forme traditionnaliste la représentation de la Jazz d'instrumentistes d'actualité pourtant elle n'est que cliché de la Be Bop périmée depuis les 1960's une hérésie sachant que toute la musique produite par les Americains noirs Hip hop , R&amp;B est par essence Jazz."
2,et a nouveau un best of meme s il s agit d un live     je suis un fan de la premiere heure mais la les maiden gonfflent un peu
1,"Pfft,encore un disque vide et mou, De Palmas refait invariablement la même chanson. C'est de la musique à Papa, composé vite fait et oublié aussi vite. passez votre chemin."
1,"En tant que grand amateur de jazz et de musique en général, tous genres confondus, je tiens à dire que cet album n'a strictement rien de jazzy ( Mon vieux Charly Parker, si il en tendait dire que N.Jones c'est du jazz ... ). Les mélodies sont très basiques, les instruments peu mis en valeur.  COmme dirai l'autre : ""Les sanglots longs des violons de l'automne Brisent mon coeur d'une langueur monotone ..."" Un album soporifique, idéal en musique de fond pour s'endormir en paix. Et surement pas du jazz."
5,"toute la BO sur CD,pour les fans du film,cette galette est indispensable!!!Les chansons sont parfaites(notamment There's a light,Time warp,Sweet transvestite,Science fiction ,et toutes les autres!).Bref,que du bonheur!A posseder à tout prix(qui n'est pas élevé pour tant de qualité)."
4,"Pianiste à la technique assurée qui mêle des sonorités de Scriabine de jeunesse et de Szymanovski avec des allusions au jeu pianistique d'un des plus grands virtuoses du début du 20ème siècle : Sergeï Prokofiev. Il émane un esprit que l'on pourrait caractériser de ""mal de siècle"" : on retrouve un côté décadent dans le sens le plus littéraire du terme jouant des archétypes mélodiques et harmoniques du début du 20ème siècle tout en alliant cette atmosphère à une délicieuse acidité jazzistique. Il alerne un jeu dans la résonance de la grande pédale avec un jeu quasi staccato de la main droite qui rappelle des moments ennivrants et quasi mécaniques des oeuvres de Prokofiev. Bref un savant mélange de modernité comme on l'entendait avant et juste après la première guerre mondiale et d'un esprit contemporain de l'improvisation solitaire remplie d'une mélancolie infinie.Un album qui vaut le détour et vous invite à une introspection inoubliable."
5,"Doit-on dire de cet album qu'il est de Miles ou de Marcus Miller ? Sans importance puisque le résultat est génial ! Funky et électronique, avec des improvisations bien maitrisées (pas de longueurs ni d'introspections jazzo intello), un très bon disque de fusion."
5,"que rajouter a tant d'eloges mentionnées ci-dessus.un autre chef d'oeuvre du genie coltrane.un soufle unique allié a une creativité sans limites font que ce grand monsieur restera a jamais un maillon incontesté de l'evolution du jazz.ce qui me rejouit ,c'est de voir ces jeunes generations reconnaissent son talent car de son vivant ' il etait tellement en avance sur son temps que les puristes ne voyer que le 'bird' et il aura fallu du temps pour que son génie soit reconu.c'etait mon pére qui m'avait fait connaitre le jazz via les artistes de sa generation tel le m.j.q,t.monk,cannonball aderley,armstrong,parker evidemment et tant d'autres.mais il lui aura falu beaucoup de temps &amp; d'ecoutes pour reconaitre le génie de coltrane.c'est cet album que je lui ai fait ecouter en 1er et c'est surement pour ça que pour moi,c'est un album a part ravivant ue passion partagée:celle du jazz.bref, un chef d'oeuvre eternel de mr.coltrane..."
5,"C'est toute la beauté du jazz, toute la multitude de cette musique que Coltrane exprime sur cet album. C'est magique, c'est un disque incontournable du grand maître."
5,"""The Big Beat"" fait partie des premiers albums réalisés par les nouveaux Jazz Messengers avec Wayne Shorter et Lee Morgan. Le disque s' ouvre par un trés beau thème de Shorter ""The Chess Players"" où Lee Morgan nous offre un solo sensationnel. Le deuxième thème toujours signé Shorter met particulièrement en valeur le leader Art Blakey dans un merveilleux long solo. Le disque contient aussi un autre superbe thème de Shorter ""Lester Left Town"". En conclusion, un des grands disques de cette formation historique."
5,"Un album riche et original dans l'esprit de ""Maiden Voyage"" , autre chef d'oeuvre de Herbie Hancock. Le dernier morceau est un rare moment musical, une quête collective de la beauté et de la poésie."
5,"Et oui, c'est un formidable album enregistré en 1980 au festival de Montreux. Oscar Peterson y est particulièrement bien entouré: N.H.O.P (contrebasse) et Kenny Clark (batterie) et c'est un régal. Témoin, le morceau-titre qui est un éternel feu d'artifice. Mais, le trio est également capable d'une grande sensibilité comme dans l'enchainement de Misty et Waltz for Debby. Bref, un grand must."
5,"Je connaissais pas et j'ai écouté. C'est top. Le Punk californien, c'est Green day (plutôt Dookie qu'American Idiot), The offspring mais aussi une place particulière pour Pennywise. Du Punk puissant et mélodieux avec des textes qui percutent. (5 étoiles aussi à ""About time"" encore meilleur)."
5,"Qu'est-ce qui me pousse à écrire? Etant un inconditionnel du quatuor, je tenais à corriger l'horreur écrite ci-dessous: Jason n'était absolument pas le chanteur mais le bassiste! Le chanteur, Jim, quant à lui est toujours là. Pennywise, c'est l'héritage parfait de l'essence Punk Californienne, le Punk politique des Black Flag pour les 70'S &amp; Bad Religion pour les 80'S (et début des années 90). Ici, du texte puissant, franchement intelligent, bercé par une voix tourmentée... Et surtout, des mélodies. Je pense plus particulièrement à ""Alien"", un des classiques du groupe.  Cet album n'est pas le meilleur à mon sens (About Time et Full Circle sont des chefs d'oeuvre), mais marque un changement radical pour Pennywise (le volant au premier plan, un indice?): celui d'un groupe muri, calmé, mais paradoxalement, et c'est ce qui fait l'ambivalence des ""grands"", toujours aussi attisé!  Après la noirceur dégagée par Full Circle (mythique fin au piano en hommage à Jason), Pennywise se renouvelle et prouve que le Punk, le vrai, n'est pas prêt de mourir.  Rapide conclusion? Des paroles magnifiques, riffs endiablés, pour un ensemble peut-être plus cohérent qu'avant. L'album qui suivra, Land of the Free, est une suite logique, plus aboutie je trouve! Néanmoins, du grand Pennywise! Le Punk est une chance, celle de pouvoir prendre la parole: la bande à Jim le sait plus que quiconque du côté de L.A. (avec Bad Religion, pères spirituels)."
5,"Personnellement, j'adore!  J'ai eu la chance d'assister à un concert de Marilyn Manson, et je peux dire que je considère ce live comme un souvenir assez fidèle de ce concert. Je trouve que cet album est tout à fait représentatif de ce qu'on peut entendre quand on va voir le groupe: ambiance, qualité de son et, ce que je trouve très positif, une sélection de titres de tous les albums du groupe, mêmes des tout premiers. Bref, si vous avez été voir Marilyn Manson en concert, ce live est un très bon souvenir; si ce n'est pas le cas, c'est un petit avant goût de ce que vous pourrez savourer lorsque vous verrez le groupe en chair et en os..."
4,"Ce fut le premier disque j'acheta. Le mix du chant rap et du son rock/metal est très réussi. D'énorme contrastes émaillent cet album : du très zen Black Cloud, au bien bourrin Toxic, a peu près tout le monde trouvera son bonheur (si l'on aime le genre bien sur). la meilleur chanson est à mon avis Butterfly (il ya d'ailleur un clip) avec sa basse omniprésente et sa mélodie de guitare très simple et agréable. Un bon disque, à acheter."
1,"Hybrid theory etait un superbe album de rock, pour moi me meilleur.Les melodies, les textes, le carnet avec les paroles tout etait superbement travaille. C'etait le meilleur groupe de rock. Je cours donc achete le second album et je decouvre quoi : une sorte de truc moitie techno moitie rap lassant( ce sont les memes chansons que dans le prmiers album retravaille ) au debut je croyais que mon discman faisait defaut mais non. Franchement je recommande ce cd pour ceux qui aiment la techno, en esperant que Linkin Park refasse du rock"
2,"Le succès de Korn et de Deftones a fait naître tout un ramassis de groupe sans aucun interet (Limb, Papa Roach, P.O.D. ...). La seul chose qui distingue Linkin de celà c'est qu'ils jouent une zic un peu moins violente pour passer à la radio. Si vous avez moins de 15 ans et que vous n'avez aucune idée de ce qu'est le métal ce disque est fait pour vous, autrement mieux vos se pencher sur les vrais groupes."
1,"De nos jours, on se demande où est passée la musique, la vraie, celle qui est faite de musiciens, celle dont la voix n'a pas été taillée sur ordinateur avec pro-tool ou cool edit. Ces groupes pour ados sans repères, Limp bizkit et Papa roach et Linkin park, on en a par dessus la tête. NUL NUL et NUL!! Aucune originalité, ces boys bands qui jouent aux méchants sont de purs produits commerciaux qui hantent les ondes radios pour le plus grand mal de nos oreilles. Une simple mode heureusement, qui disparaitra on l'espère d'ici peu, mais en attendant on ne peut que s'allier pour la défense de la musique et la mise à mort de ces groupes pour ados ""rebelles"" dont la médiocrité n'a de cesse de s'accroitre. Ce genre de chose se vend, et même très bien, et ça laisse songeur pour l'avenir de la créativité. Auditeurs, je ne saurais que vous conseiller de chercher un peu les vrais groupes, des groupes peu connus, des groupes d'il y'a déjà quelques années (pourquoi pas?), mais enfin, évitez ce massacre."
4,"j'ai découvert DYONISOS en zappant un soir sur les victoires de la musique( dieu sait que c'est pas mon style de programme) . et la je suis resté scotché à mon écran; quelle pêche. Western sous la neige est un album eclectique tant au niveau des rythmes que des sons. que vous soyez nostalgiques du rock alternatif d'il y a dix ans ou que vous soyez branchés MICKEY 3D cet album vous ravira. mention spéciale pour les morceaux  DON DIEGO 200, LONGBOARD BLUES,LONGBOARD TRAIN"
5,"Par ce CD Live, on retrouve la tournée Indochinoise de 1997, le Wax Tour. Ici en Belgique, Indochine se retrouve dans son univers et on ressent une véritable communion avec le public. Indochine, délaissé des médias, peut compter sur son public qui connait tous les textes par coeur. Un CD inoubliable avec une participation de Dimitri Bodianski au saxophone notamment. Néanmoins, petit plus pour le DVD qui a l'avantage de proposer l'image en plus. ;) Difficile effectivement de ressentir la complicité entre Stef et Nicola sur le CD..."
2,"Soyons clair : je n'ai absolument rien contre le R&amp;B. Sans être un grand connaisseur, j'apprécie Kelis et certaines autres productions des Neptunes. Cependant, ce disque ne m'a vraiment pas accroché.  J'avais en tête WUZ, avec Gopher, et ce disque en est à mille lieux !! J'attendais peut-être trop de ce disque, présenté comme LE truc electro français du moment (je met à part Air, qui ne joue pas dans le même registre). Il y a biens quelques sons, quelques textures qui m'ont titillées, mais, et je suis vraiment désolé de le dire, rien de trés ""bandant""."
2,"Décidement depuis l'album Machina Corgan ne nous sort plus rien de bon. Les épisodes Zwan et en solo n'ont vraiment pas convaincus, et voilà donc que notre ami Billy nous annonce la ""reformation"" du groupe depuis plus d'un an. Enfin, je vois pas trop où se trouve la reformation étant donné que ni James Iha, ni d'Arcy ne se trouvent encore dans le groupe. En gros c'est quoi la différence avec les anciennes formations (zwan...), peut-être que le nom Smashing Pumpkins vend mieux... Pour ce dernier ""opus"" je met tout de même 2 étoiles car je le trouve moins mauvais que Machina, mais on est toujours très loin de leur période de gloire (Siamese Dream, Melon Collie &amp; The infinite sadness, même Ava Adore que je trouve encore très bon). On ne retrouve décidément plus le son d'antan ni les mélodies qu'ils étaient capable de nous composer... Donc ne serait-il pas plus sage d'arrêter ce groupe que j'estimait beaucoup autre fois, mais qui nous apporte déception sur déception depuis les années 2000..."
5,"Metallica fournit ici son plus bel effort, tant au niveau du son, que des compositions et du concetpt. Le Black Album a un côté mystique, humble. La finesse dans la composition est là du début à la fin, et c'est cette alliance de brutalité et de sensibilité qui fait toute la magie de cette recette impérissable. Les musiciens sont dans une forme incroyable et parviennent à communiquer toute une palette de sensations à l'auditeur, grâce à des morceaux aussi opposés que ""Sad But True"" et ""Nothing Else Matters"". Au niveau rythmique, c'est simple et redoutable.  Si pourtant ce disque n'invente rien, il fournit un excellent panorama, comme un condensé, ou même une vulgarisation (comme beaucoup doivent le penser) du métal en général. Il l'a mis à portée du plus grand nombre."
1,"J'ai voulu suivre les commentaires elogieux sur cet album et j'ai ete extremement decu : j'ai eu beau l'ecouter en boucle 5 ou six fois, impossible de m'y faire."
4,"Difficile album pour les Pixies car il suivait l'incroyable Doolittle.C'est forcément moins bon,le groupe essaie de faire quelque chose de plus ""facile"",et perd un peu de sa folie sur ce disque.Mais c'est quand même nettement au-dessus de toute la production pop actuelle,et n'importe quel groupe d'aujourd'hui n'arrivera jamais à tailler une chanson de l'envergure de ""Velouria"" ou d'""Allison"".A avoir quand même donc."
4,un album d'anthrax qui mérite l'attention de tout un chacun. A ecouter d'urgence surtout avec des titres comme pacackaged rebellion et potters field voila....
5,"C'est limpide, rythmé et fort. Voix grave, musique gothique avec des intros géniales."
4,"Finalement, on a un peu oublié Hüsker Dü, c'est dommage car c'est un groupe tellement génial... Candy Apple Grey est un album très varié et dégage une belle atmosphère; un peu triste, mais il y a une âme qui se dégage de ces chansons. J'aime beaucoup aussi le côté anti-rock star de cette formation, des ""vrais"" punks en fait!! Comme diraient les djeuunss aujourd'hui "" Total Respect"" :-)"
5,"Sat la voix la plus Marseillaise de la Fonky Familly, nous offre un magnifique album. Dans lequel il s'inspire de sa propore vie et nous montre là, qu'il a un tallent remarquable. De la première chanson à la dernière on acroche à ses textes profond dans lequels on peut se retrouver. Par rapport à d'autre album ceuli là et loin d'étre un album monotone, il déchire grave. C'est un album a acheter absolument."
1,"Cet album peut se resumer assez facilement: une intro de guitare, accordee tres bas pour donner plus de peche a des riffs sans imagination, la batterie qui rentre, puis la suite, ennuyeuse, avec des couplets a peine chantes. Tout se ressemble, rien ne se distingue, a part la tres bonne chanson qui a donne son titre a l'album, et qui est l'unique satisfaction (meme la pochette est a vomir). Mention particuliere au son de caisse claire, qui sonne tellement comme une casserole qu'on la croirait empruntee a Maite. Dommage que Metallica finisse comme ca."
5,"Un album très agréable à écouter. Tout l'album est aussi bon, voir meilleur que la chanson Feel, sortie en 1er single. Pour ceux qui ne connaissent pas encore le répertoire de Robbie Williams, vous pouvez y aller les yeux fermés !!!"
2,"Sincerement, je suis un grand fan des foo fighters et je n'ai pas trop aimé cet album. Trop plat, on est bien loin de ""The Color And The Shape"", tant au niveau du son qui est tout simplement crade que par les compos elle meme qui sont fades."
5,"Même si je suis fan d'autres groupes je dois reconnaitre que ce Official Live : 101 Proof de Pantera est la meilleure galette live en ma possession. Tout d'abord, ce qui frappe c'est l'énormité du son qui est très bon, car on distingue parfaitement chaque instrument + le public. Le batteur est au top, son jeu est aussi fourni et technique que sur album studio. La guitarre est impressionnante de facilité, même dans les solos complexes. La basse est - comme toujours chez Pantera - bien audible, et je suis surpris de voir que j'y porte plus d'attention que d'habitude, notament pendant les solos de guitarres. Quant à la voix est est tout simplement juste et sans retenue. A plusieurs reprises, on se demande si Phil pourra chanter la suivante tellement il s'écorche les cordes vocales ! De plus, et comme souvent, ce live peut faire office de best of du groupe. Trop bien !!! (Je mettrais bien 6 étoiles :-)"
5,"quel magnifique cd !!!!!!!! merci celine pour ce disque splendide que tu nous offres. Les chansons sont une pure merveille et ne parlons pas de l'orchestration qui est pour moi la plus belle des albums de céline. Que dire à part que ce cd est une perle, surtout my precious one la plus belle chanson du disque ainsi que in some small way. les photos sont d'une réussite totale, merci céline pour ce beau cadeau !!!!!!!!!"
1,"Celine Dion possède une voix magnifique, c'est évident !!! Mais après son très mauvais album ""A new Day has come"", elle revient moins d'un an après, avec un album encore plus commercial et insipide. De la dance bas de gamme, des mélodies déjà milles fois entendues...etc Le massacre de la chanson ""I drove all Night"" si merveilleusement interprétée par Cyndi Lauper , en est le point culminant (ou plutôt l'abime)."
4,Io canto signe tout le charme de l'Italie. On y retrouve ce soleil et cette voix unique de Laura Pausini qui reflète si bien toute la rondeur et les couleurs de son pays. Je suis et reste une inconditionnelle de cette chaleur vocale. Io canto ou je chante est un moment unique dans mon univers musical.
5,"tout simplement génial, on a attendu trop longtemps mais si les retour sont tous comme ça, on en redemande. Certains ttres sont dans la même lignée que ""never gone"". Merci les backstreet boys..."
5,"All of his major hits are here. The remastered audio is outstanding, to say the least. I can hear evey single nuance of the music.  It's as if I were present at the original studio sessions. The only thing I didn't like, in this respect, is that Yoko's wild, maniacal caterwauling can now be heard loud and clear on the Xmas track. Was that there all the time?  Or is this another one of her ploys to say ""Here I am, again folks!""? Anywho, it's a great collection in my book!"
2,"Sans être mon groupe favori, je reconnais à u2 le statut d'icône ""vivante"" du rock, à l'instar des Stones, d'ACDC et de Springsteen. Ces mecs ont quand même pondu The Joshua Tree et écrit plus tard One. Bref ce groupe nous a habitué à de sacrées hauteurs, mais là, c'est presque la morne plaine. Le single n'a aucun intérêt, Fez est un courant d'air, les mélodies sont à l'avenant et plutôt mineures...Quelques bons trucs tels Stand Up Comedy, Breathe ou éventuellement White as Snow. Comme retour, c'est plutôt moyen, à la différence d'ACDC qui cartonne à juste titre."
2,"Malheureusement, U2 n'est plus ce qu'il était dans les années 90... Quelques bons passages de ci de là (les 2 premières chansons sont bonnes), mais sinon ça frise parfois le ridicule... mielleux et poussif, ça fait très soupe commerciale par moments. Ca paraît presque fou sur certaines chansons qu'ils aient osé les sortir ! Come on, U2, reposez vous maintenant! Vous êtes assez riches comme ça, que diable ne vous tournez pas en ridicule !"
2,"Hélas, quelle ne fut pas ma déception - aucun reproche technique  à faire - mais bien un reproche artistique - Je serais tenté de de dire que 2 tels maîtres se neutralisent :  Du point de vue des sonorités pas suffisamment distinctes même si le jeu de chacun est fort reconnaissable, du point de vue des interprétations qui ne dégagent pas suffisamment leur génie de la construction, du point vue du cursus de lecture du disque qui n'offre ni cohérence, ni progression, enfin du point de vue de l'énergie plutôt parent pauvre de cet album.  On s'y ennuie presque tant tout cela parait plat. Seuls ""Ring of the life"" et ""Say the brother name"" bénéficie de l'apport indispensable d'une rythmique de qualité à la fois expressive et infaillible. Le bon choix eu certainement été celui de doter chaque plage de cet apport contrebasse, batterie :  il aurait su véritablement trouver sa place sur ces registres beaucoup moins dynamiques  (eh oui - Cf Neighbourhood de Manu Katché par exemple) Deux disque à ré-écouter et qui prennent bien le contre-pied sur le point vue des collaboration, elles cette fois très réussies :  ""Blues Cruise"" pour Brad melldau  avec Chris Cheek et ""Brigth Size Life"" pour Metheny avec Pastorius Eh Oui, il ne suffit pas d'avoir les ingrédients de premier choix pour faire une cuisine trois étoiles."
2,"Je m'attendais à mieux ce la part de MIA que des sonorités, certes tranchantes mais mises au service de titres par trop répétitifs et finalement sans beaucoup d'imagination. Bilan des courses? L'ouverture de l'album laisse à penser que l'on va s'amuser, passer un bon moment quand à l'arrivée, on peine à aller au bout du disque sans être fatigué par une certaine redondance. Dommage, aurait vraiment pu mieux faire car le talent est bien là, on le sent poindre..."
4,"Les 7 premiers titres constituent presque un album à eux seuls aboutissant à ""the past is a grotesque animal"".  Les paroles de cette chanson font référence à des textes plutôt sombres (georges bataille et edward albee ""qui a peur de virginia wolf ?""). La compréhension des paroles n'est pas indispensable mais elle complétera efficacement la tension procurée par le rythme et la montée en puissance progressive des choeurs et des instruments. La fin de l'album fait retomber cette ambiance un peu comme si l'on passait à  la seconde face. A écouter séparément peut être."
5,"Voilà un artiste qui fait une entrée fracassante dans l'histoire de l'électro avec cet album. : L'album nous offre un cursus sans accro, on évolue au fur et mesure des plages d'un univers riche, gras vers une techno indus, dark (en fin d'album)qui n'est pas sans me rappeler sous certains aspect Monolake (gravity) et de façon enchaînée.  Force est aussi de reconnaître que l'habileté de trentemoller réside dans sa capacité à faire évoluer en permanence ses mélodies avec l' appui d' échos, de nappes rondes, et de  sons acoustiques qui contribuent à vraiment signer sa musique. Il s'adjoint d'ailleurs les  services de guitarites, de bassistes lorsque cela est utile. Il sait aussi parfaitement marrier la matitude de certains sons avec la brillance d'autres. L'ensemble se révèle punchy, finement ciselé et détaillé. Enfin les dosages d' ""accoustique""  contribuent à nous étonner surtout dans univers plutôt appréhendé froid.  À situer quelque-part entre Monolake - Amon Tobin - Kowalski - Sten."
5,"Le deuxième est de loin le meilleur album de ces Frenchies! Que des tubes! Si vous aimez le downtempo, le trip-hop... N'hésiter pas! C'est aussi puissant que Massive Attack, Portishead ou encore The Avalanches, mais à la French Touch!!! Si Wax Tailor n'existerait pas il faudrait l'inventer..."
5,"Ainsi donc voici la nouvelle merveille electro-trip hop anglaise... Pas besoin de faire la fine bouche, l'album est excellent ! Déjà, le groupe s'est super bien entouré: Jarvis Cocker de Pulp pour les conseils, Richard Hawley est venu preter sa guitare.  Pour les tubes, on est servi: Daydream in Blue qui utilise le meme sample que le Squares du Beta Band, un sublime et entetant Heaven et un Who is She dantesque, visiblement une chanson obscure d'une BO des sixties chantée par un clone de Jay Jay Johanson, relookée par I Monster, magnifique. Parfois, les morceaux ressemblent étrangement à des inédits de Air, mais ce qui fait la différence chez I Monster, c'est le coté ludique de certains titres, comme Backseat of my car, chanté avec un accent français poilant et diablement sensuel. Bref une réussite, un grand album electronique qui brasse avec talent psychadélisme, BO sixties, variété et trip hop."
4,"""Natural blues"" et ""Lift me up"" sont pour moi les deux morceaux de choix qui méritent chacun 5 étoiles. ""Slipping away"", le duo avec Mylène Farmer, m'a surpris par sa qualité. Rythme, blues, dance, le tourbillon vous emporte.  J'aime tout simplement."
2,"Si vous aimez Good Charlotte, ce qui est mon cas depuis 5 ans, vous serez sans doute déçus par ce nouvel album. Les chansons s'enchaînent et se ressemblent. La niaque de Festival song,la beauté douce-amère d'Emotionless ou de Screamer,l'engagement et l'espoir de We Believe ou de Hold On, tout cela a disparu au profit de sons aseptisés électro-pop et de gros renforts de.... bruits , histoire de pouvoir encore être classé dans la catégorie Indé. Si quelques unes des chansons gardent un frémissement de ce que fut ce groupe avant ce dérapage, c'est pour mieux nous laisser sur notre faim. Pour ceux qui comprennent les paroles, et dieu sait qu'il se font rare, la aussi le bât blesse....Certaines paroles sont belles ou plus recherchées que ""touche pas à ma nana"" mais beaucoup tournent au ridicule, ou au déjà vu. Coincées entre les ""levez les mains et dites ""je ne veux pas être amoureux"" "" ou autre ""oh oh oh oh victimes de l'amour"", des paroles telles que ""papa est-ce qu'on pourrait tout recommencer, ramène moi la ou on vivait avant que ces jours n'arrivent et nous fassent vieillir. Je veux retrouver le sentiment que j'éprouvais à l'époque, avant que mon coeur ne se glace"" perdent un peu de leur sens. La majorité des chansons tournent autour de la fille qui te fait du mal et de ton coeur qui est brisé et qui ne veut plus aimer, du monde qui est moche mais beau quand même. Thèmes déjà fortement utilisés dans « The Chronicles of Life &amp; Death » ce qui nous donne quelques réminiscences, par exemple, de We Believe « laissons le pardon effacer la douleur » dans A Beautiful Place « laissons l'amour effacer ces douleurs ». En plus des « déjà vus » la plupart des chansons manquent de....couplets. Certaines semblent constituées uniquement de refrains, et en définitif, il y a un nombre très réduit de paroles dans une chanson. Un album qui décevra sûrement les fans de la première heure pour qui le premier album a marqué le ton, ou encore ceux qui portent une importance particulière aux paroles. En fait de « revival » il nous est plutôt offert une régression, ce 4ème album ressemblant d'avantage à un premier que leur véritable premier album."
5,"This is a GREAT ALBUM! I heard Patricia Kaas and her famous Mon Mec à Moi in my French class, and I became to love this French singer and her music. C'est trés bien!"
2,"Les chansons ""Mon frère"" &amp; ""l'envie d'aimer"" sont les seuls réussites de ce disque! Celui de Roméo et Juliette est Beaucoup plus émouvant et romantique. Quand au spectacle, c'est très déçevant! Malgré sa longue durée, celui de Roméo &amp; Juliette est beaucoup plus palpitant! .3h00 de bonheur contre 1h55 d'ennui ! Mais ce n'est pas nul ..."
5,AprEs avoir vu le spectacle ce CD vous fera repenser A toutes les merveilleuses Emotions que vous avez pu ressentir en le voyant.Les chansons sont tout simplement speldides et pleines d'amour et d'Emotion.
2,"Byrne et Eno ont apporté tous deux, séparément et ensemble, une contribution si essentielle au rock qu'on ne pouvait que saliver à l'idée d'une nouvelle collaboration entre ces têtes non pas parlantes, mais chercheuses. La surprise est grande quand on réalise que ""Everything That Happens Will Happen Today"" est un disque qui recycle gentiment les découvertes passées de nos deux larrons, qui se sont - ils l'avouent naïvement - à peine rencontrés pour construire ce disque : on retrouve cette idée déjà largement exploitée - et mieux qu'ici - chez les Talking Heads d'un gospel païen, basé sur une élévation, un abandon qui seraient moins spirituels que sensuels. Une idée déclinée sur des chansons systématiquement mid-tempo, qui pour être séduisantes, ne sont pas aussi excitantes qu'elles devraient. Bref, voici un album intelligent (c'est bien le moins qu'on pouvait attendre !), plaisant, voire charmeur, mais pas tout-à-fait digne d'une telle conjugaison de talents."
2,"Soit , lorsque cet album est sorti , le métal prog n'en était encore qu'à ses premiers balbutiements . Certains ( mal informés ) ont prétendu que DT avait inventé ce nouveau genre de musique qui est un savant mélange de métal et de prog ( qui l'eut cru ? ) . Bien évidemment , il n'en est rien ( voire Crimson glory ou Watchtower par exemple ) . On parlera donc de DT comme le groupe qui a largement popularisé ce style de musique .  En termes de qualité , l'album ""Images and words"" est moins bon que le suivant (""Awake"") et il est nettement inférieur à ""Metropolis: Songs from a memory"" , il n'est donc certainement pas le meilleur . En revanche , il est assez ""commercial"" dans la démarche et à mes yeux probablement le mieux formaté pour séduire un large public . Pour ma part , je ne l'écoute quasiment plus car je trouve les compositions assez plates , à l'exception de 2 ou 3 , dont le morceau très court composé par le talentueux et regretté K.Moore .  ""Images and words"" est donc un album qui a permis de populariser le prog métal et d'ouvrir la voie à pas mal d'autres formations mais il ne mérite absolument pas le qualificatif de chef-d'oeuvre que quelques-uns ont utilisé un peu hâtivement à son sujet !"
2,"Dur de devoir critiquer cet album sans encourir les foudres des fans en extases. M'enfin, cette chanteuse doit son succès avant tout à son style et aux artifices qui vont avec. On ne peut pas nier que nombres de ces titres ont fait mouche mais pour moi un chanteur est quelqu'un qui sait chanter et là cette voix timide et en retrait à tendance m'énerver. Quant à ce CD, c'est comme avant et en moins bien mais en plus cher."
1,"Oui Metallica se remet en question d'un album à l'autre. Oui Metallica est un groupe culte. Oui Metallica n'a besoin de personne pour faure de la musique...et bien pourtant cet album est une pure horreur, tant au niveau du son, que des mélodies, que des paroles...Cet album n'a de place dans une discothèque qu'en tant que premier album d'un groupe, pas en tant qu'album lié à son renouveau, à moins que Metallica ai choisit de se tourner vers du Nu-Metal bien commercial...c'est bien dommage..."
1,"Enorme déception pour cet album de Coldplay. Je suis un fan de leurs premiers disques (Parachutes en tête) et je me demande s'il s'agit bien du même groupe. Là où les premiers albums jouaient sur un minimalisme guitarres/Basse/batterie assez peu produit mais terriblement séduisants et bruts, ce dernier disque est un fatras d'instruments complètement surproduit. Le titre éponyme en est l'illustration parfaite, on ne reconnait aucun instrument, tous les instruments se mélangent sans trouver leur place. Bref, si vous aimiez les premiers disques, celui ci devrait vous laisser dubitatifs (au mieux). Espérons que Brian Eno et Coldplay ne rééditerons pas l'expérience. A eviter."
5,"Tous les goûts sont dans la nature et moi je trouve cet album excellent: musique planante, arrangements musicaux de folie, voix qui vous transporte litteralement... bref j'adore.. Et puis ça fait vraiment du bien d'écouter de la bonne pop, avec tout ce que nos oreilles subissent par les temps qui courent..."
2,"Le 4ème Coldplay cumule les tares : venir après la magnificence mélodique de ""XY"" sans lui arriver au genou, viser à travers sa très passionnante pochette à un signifiant artistique et intellectuel incompatible avec la plaisante banalité de la bande à Chris Martin, et surtout demander à Eno, fausse bonne idée, de recouvrir toutes les chansons - déjà évanescentes - d'une couche bien lisse de raffinement post-moderne, néo-world et surtout très chic et très toc. Le résultat est un disque sans vie, non dépourvu de beauté, mais une beauté comme préservée sous cellophane. Asphyxiée."
2,"Très déçue par ce nouvel album, OK on comprend vite que miss Anaïs est amoureuse et nous le chante sur tous les modes et tons, bien sûr on retrouve son côté joueur avec les mots mais ça ne suffit plus, vivement qu'elle divorce lol !"
2,"Et en l'occurrence, s'appelle Universal, qui distribue l'objet. Ils ont intérêt à en refourguer, de ce Cd, les Mars Volta, ou gare au carton rouge de la major.  Et bien, après quelques écoutes, c'est pas gagné. Même s'il ne fait pas de doute que pour les Mars Volta, ce « Bedlam ... » est l'oeuvre de leur vie. Qui se cache derrière un concept n'importequoitesque mêlant prophéties, malédictions et démons. Le tout juste bon à inquiéter ceux qui croient encore au Père Noel. Faudra que les Mars Volta causent à leur dealer. Il leur a fourgué une came qui apparemment leur a foutu un pet au casque... Mais si l'enrobage prête à sourire, au niveau musique, c'est plus sérieux. Un son colossal met la hi-fi à rude épreuve. J'ai rarement entendu quelque chose présentant une telle dynamique et une telle puissance sonore.  Dès les premiers accords du premier titre, une référence vient immédiatement à l'esprit : « Red », le chef d'oeuvre sombre et torturé de King Crimson. Et dès lors, obligatoirement, vont venir les termes qui fâchent : rock progressif. Car c'est souvent bien de cela qu'il s'agit. Ces morceaux interminables, pleins à la gueule de breaks, de changements de rythme, de progressions d'accords tarabiscotés, ... et d'auto complaisance. Remontent alors à la surface les remugles de ces affreux groupes de hard progressif américains de la fin des 70's : Boston, Kansas, Rush, Saga, ... ce genre d'horreurs. Que les Mars Volta, on l'espère pour eux, n'ont jamais dû écouter. N'empêche que ce qu'ils voulaient grandiose sonne grandiloquent et que ces grandes cavalcades épiques redondantes finissent par lasser. « Bedlam ... » est le genre de disque qui marque un tournant dans la carrière d'un groupe. A mon avis, celle des Mars Volta risque de partir en sucette. J'espère pour eux me tromper."
5,"Album tout à fait conforme au film , excellent et tonique . Rien à jeter pour ainsi dire : la voix de john cameron mitchell est ambiguë à souhait , mais pas maniérée . Les compos de stephen trask qui joue le guitariste dans le film , sont à la fois variées et très musicales ... j'y vois un mix entre celles de lou reed ( première période , avant les muscles ) celles de jim steinman ( pour meat loaf par exemple ) et celles de jayne county ( autrefois wayne county quand il était encore un garçon ) ... B.O remarquable donc , avec un ""origin of love"" platonicien d'enfer , et un ""wig in a box"" à la fois émouvant ( au début ) et déjanté à la fin ! Dans le film , il y a un karaoké pour cette chanson et on peut chanter . Génial !"
2,Que dire devant un album aussi decevant que longtemps espéré. Décidement je crois que les amateurs de nouveautés métal de qualité se tourneront vers la scène française. Les nouveaux sons ou mélodies recherchées sont totalement dénuées de vie et de rage. On est très loin de la qualités des deux premiers albums !
4,"excellent album a mon gout, dans la ligné de Follow The Leader, mais en beaucoup plus sombre . De gros hits comme Falling Away From Me, Make Me Bad et Somebody Someone, avec egalement de bon titres sympas a ecouter .TRes bonne qualité, je n'aime pas trop les interlude qui sont pour moi inutile ."
1,"Il s'agit là d'une grosse production américaine ou le talent du producteur et la thune de la maison de disque priment par rapport au talent des musiciens, qui est d'ailleurs ici quasiment inexistant. Le premier album etait encore assez original, mais là on a vraiment l'impression d'écouter de la variette. Désolé pour les fans mais vous n'avez rien capter: c'est pas de la musique mais de la soupe commerciale."
2,"2 albums métal et 1 rap/métal (très bon)sous le bras, revoilà Korn pour un quatrième opus. Mais si l'enthousiasme était réel avant sa sortie, c'est la déception qui prime à l'écoute de ""Issues"". Après nous avoir fait vibré sur des rythmes hip-hop, Korn propose un retour vers des sources plus métal. Les critiques ont dépeint cet album comme sombre et tranchant, je le trouve pour ma part un peu faiblard. La musique de Korn sur ""Issues"" n'est pas obscure, elle est molle. Où est passée la rage des deux premiers albums ? Qu'est devenu le génie inventif aperçu sur ""Follow The Leader"" ? L'argent et le succès seraient-ils venus à bout de la créativité et de l'énergie de Korn ? L'auditeur que nous sommes tous ne peut qu'être perplexe à l'examen de ""Issues""..."
5,Earthlingonfire Dit l'essentiel dans son commentaire très trsè juste...C'est merveilleux de retrouver cette impression ressentie a Pantin ce fameux soir ou j'ai pris une énorme giffle...La plus belle de toute ma vie.Ce live est sublime...
5,"Après 4 albums studios d'une rare efficacité (Lovedrive / Love At First Sting / Blackout / Animal Magnetism), Scorpions a atteint le sommet de sa popularité : World Wide Live termine le travail en beauté avec une set-list impeccable et une ambiance extraordinaire ! Je pèse mes mots : aucune compilation du groupe ne vaut cet album !"
5,"Après 4 albums studios d'une rare efficacité (Lovedrive / Love At First Sting / Blackout / Animal Magnetism), Scorpions a atteint le sommet de sa popularité : World Wide Live termine le travail en beauté avec une set-list impeccable et une ambiance extraordinaire ! Je pèse mes mots : aucune compilation du groupe ne vaut cet album !"
5,"Alors par quel bout commencer ? L'album, souvent cité comme l'un des plus spectaculaires live de l'histoire du rock, pourrait certainement susciter un commentaire détaillé, morceau par morceau, mais si l'on veut rester dans son esprit rageur et efficace, je ne retiendrais que l'essentiel : cette impression d'énergie qu'on pourrait appeler juvénile encadré par un métier impressionnant. Quelle maîtrise dans une telle furie (tuerie ?) ! Les membres du Blue Oyster Cult ont un jour dans une interview avoué qu'ils avaient commencé avec beaucoup plus de bruit et fureur que de talent. Trop modestes ? La fureur est toujours là, le talent évident. Le soliste, Buck Dharma, est sans aucun doute le guitariste le plus injustement sous-estimé de sa génération. Son style est accrocheur, pour ne pas dire teigneux, tout en restant aérien. Ses phrasés sont caractérisés par une attaque tranchante, très vive et prompte à nous cisailler avec application le nerf auditif. Il arpente le manche avec force fluidité, les gammes blues et mineur harmonique coulent avec une vélocité irrésistible pour l'auditeur, il alterne les plans rock, les appogiatures sur tempi rapides, le bougre ne nous laisse aucun répit. Grande générosité pour un groupe soudé, à la cohésion jamais prise en défaut. Cet album est une traversée dont on ne ressort pas totalement indemne et peut-être la meilleure synthèse de la puissance du BOC."
1,"Robert Plant avec Led Zeppelin c'est le plus grand chanteur que le Hard Rock est connu, en solo c'est navrant, rien à voir avec le Rock c'est plus près des polyphonies Corse qu'autre chose. Bon y en a qui aime ça"
5,"Led Zeppelin a fait beaucoup d'autres bons albums après la sortie de celui-ci; cependant, il n'existe aucun, mais aucun, autre album de ce groupe qui représente mieux la véritable identité de celui-ci.Là on trouve à la fois : du hard, du rock et du blues.....c'est tout. Led Zep fera d'autres expériences avec notamment le ""3"", ""the songs remain the same"", le très controversé ""Phisycal Graffiti"" et le pitoyable ""presence"", mais aucun ne sera à la hauteur du ""vrai"" Led Zeppelin 1""."
5,"Récemment, une pub pour la photo numérique a utilisé la chanson ""People Take Pictures of Each Other"" pour vanter le mérite de ses produits ... sans prêter plus d'attention aux paroles pleines d'ironie de Ray Davies, qui raillent précisément ce tic moderne des gens qui se photographient : ""People take pictures of each other, just to prove that they really existed"". Le cas des Kinks est justement là : des mélodies colorées, à la séduction pop imparable, et des textes presque toujours à double sens, noirs et cinglants. Mais les clichés d'une Angleterre de souvenirs ici rassemblés dans cet album somptueux, n'ont jamais vraiment existé : tout a été fabriqué par l'esprit génial et tordu de son créateur, Ray Davies, alors au sommet de son écriture et saisi soudainement d'une sorte de nostalgie compensatoire car, alors que les temps changent à toute vitesse (on est en 68!), les Kinks au contraire se replient vers ce qu'ils savent faire le mieux : de la Pop avec une majuscule. Et tandis que des révolutionnaires s'agitent en ville, les Kinks prennent le thé au jardin et s'extasient des derniers parfums du soir, des ombres mauves et bleues sur la pelouse, du charme bucolique de la campagne anglaise. Davies se souvient de son pote Walter (""Do You Remember Walter ?"") avec qui il fumait en cachette derrière le préau de l'école, et de Daisy, son premier amour ... mais voilà, Walter n'a plus rien d'un ami et Daisy a finalement épousé l'épicier du Village Vert. Et quand Davies évoque un train à vapeur (dans le rock&amp; roll ""Last of The Steam-Powered Train""), on comprend que cette suite de pop songs nostalgiques est aussi une suite anachronique de sketches, à l'ironie cinglante. Et plutôt désespérée. Ce disque magnifique mais déconnecté de son temps, ne rencontrera guère le succès escompté. Seul le single ""Days"", ici inclus en bonus-track de rêve (avec ""Mr Songbird""), se classera alors dans les charts. C'est d'ailleurs l'une des chansons les plus poignantes de Ray : dédiée à sa femme, qui est alors sur le point de le quitter, elle joue encore plus que l'album sur la corde nostalgique : ""I won't forget a single day, believe me / And though you're gone / You're with me every single day, believe me""."
2,"Queen fut indiscutablement un groupe novateur, en tout point....mais voila, cet qualité finit par se retourner contre eux, avec cet album qui sort de nulle part....A force d'explorer divers horizons, les 4 musiciens se sont un peu fourvoyés...et le résultat fut décevant....pas seulement d'un point de vue commercial....L'ensemble des morceaux lorgnent vers la disco et le funk, ce qui, je pense n'a pas lieu d'être dans la discogrâphie d'un groupe comme Queen.....Voila l'album qui restera toujours d'après moi, l'erreur, la parenthèse, du groupe......"
2,"Je suis fan de Queen avec une tendance a être même un peu indulgent devant certaines de leurs oeuvres. Mais franchement, ici, rien de terrible ! Un son surproduit et sans relief, quelques idées mais pas de réelle inspiration, une évidente tentative de surf sur la génèse de la vague acid house (invisible man) en vogue à l'époque. Ce n'est certes pas, le pire de leur album, mais ils ont fait beaucoup mieux après et surtout avant."
1,"Recommandation express : cet album de Queen est celui que je classerai, dans ma liste de mes preférés, en dernier ! En somme j'ai tous les albums de Queen, soit 15 albums (je n'comte pas les lives et best of), et cet album est un gachi ! C'est l'album qui suit l'enregistrement de la B.O. du film ""FLASH GORDON"", ce qui veut donc dire qu'ils ont utilisés des SYNTHES pour cette B.O., et c'était la première fois pour Queen ! On entre aussi dans les années 80... Le groupe, du coup décide d'incorporer l'instrument à leur composition, et étant leur premier-vrai album avec ce nouveau-venu, ils s'égarent, et ont du mal à trouver l'équilibre qu'ils trouveront un peu plus tard. Le résultat est assez indigeste, je dois bien l'admettre, mais cet album était sans doute utile pour leur évolution et leur permettre de trouver leur marque avec l'apparition du synthé dans leurs chansons. Car rappelons-le, Queen était contre le synthé et mentionnait sur les pochettes des premiers albums qu'ils n'utilisaient pas de synthé !!! Cela dit, on trouve qd même sur cet album ""Under Pressure"" avec DAVID BOWIE (le seul et unique duo de toute la carrière de Queen !) et ""Las Palabras De Amor"", superbe. Mais c'est TOUT !"
1,"A part ""Under pressure"" avec Bowie, le reste est à jeter. Fallait bien manger à l'époque et je ne leur jette pas la pierre; parfois, certains artistes ne devraient quand même pas se compromettre comme cela. ""Queen"" n'est pas doué pour la dance-pop."
5,"Cela nous laisse un gout de Beattles dans la bouche, et pourtant c'est bel et bien Deep Purple. Ce son psychadélique et typiquement 60's de la formation MK1 est pour moi, n'en déplaise à certains, ce que Deep Purple a fait de mieux en matière de composition, les trois albums sont à posséder, non seulement pour les duos fabuleux de Lord et Blackmore (la grande époque de sa pédale wah wah en apothéose), mais aussi pour la voix profonde et envoutante de Evans, pour l'incroyable basse de Simper (que je trouve nettement mieux que Glover) et pour le jeu frais et sans limite du jeune Paice!! Du pur bonheur!"
5,Ce disque est inoui !Une alliance jamais égalée jusqu'à présent entre la musique planante et la guitare électrique. Il n'y a pas de synthés dans ce disque à ma connaissance. Je me souviens les avoir vus sur scène à Lyon et la performance était aussi ahurissante sur scène que sur le disque.
5,"La voix d'Elvis chaude, exceptionnelle est tellement prenante dans ces interprétation de Gospels. La rareté de son timbre vocal est incontournable. Il faut l'entendre et le savourer !!!"
5,"Celui qui deviendra bientôt le Boss possède déjà l'incroyable générosité qui va faire sa réputation. Les thèmes favoris de Springsteen sont déjà là, et sa musique déborde d'énergie. A recommander."
1,"A mon sens, le pire du boss ! Je suis d'accord avec Luc B., c'est plat avec surtout rien qui ne dépasse, pas de guitares cinglantes, plus de caisse claire qui tape, pas de petites notes claires et magiques de piano. C'est déprimant ! sans saveur, inodore. Même la pochette est hideuse ! Quant aux morceaux, il n'y a rien qui surnage. La première écoute m'avait laissé sur ma faim, mais après plusieurs séances, vraiment je ne peux plus l'écouter. Tout se ressemble et la production est une catastrophe. J'en viendrai presque à regretter ""Born in the USA"", c'est dire ! A mon sens, le gachis de l'année..."
2,"Rien d'indigne ici, mais rien de vraiment valable non plus à un The wrestler près. On ne peut se résigner à un tel robinet d'eau tiédasse de la part de l'auteur de Jungleland, Thunder Road, Point Blank, Racing in the street, Downbound train... Et dire que certains dénonçaient le ""remplissage"" de The River : le fan se damnerait aujourd'hui pour un Ramrod, un Little girl I wanna marry you ou un I'm a rocker !!! Et Tunnel of Love à côté des quatre derniers albums, c'est Blonde on blonde ! Soyons clair : au mieux, en studio, Bruce sait encore façonner des chansons pop sympas (type : Girls in their summer clothes)ou reprendre le patrimoine (The Seeger sessions). Pour consoler les grognards, reste l'homme (intègre) et le performer live (inégalable). Et les albums de l'âge d'or. Ce n'est pas rien."
1,"Hormis le très excellent album ""Still got the blues"", on sent que Gary Moore est un peu en panne d'inspiration...  Ses albums ne sont que du gros son qu'on a déjà entendu..."
2,"Cela fait près de 20 ans que Gary Moore n'a pas fait un album qui ""décolle"" réellement, on a l'impression d'avoir écouté ce type de CD déja une centaine de fois. Un de plus sur la pile."
1,Une erreur de parcours dans la carrière de John Fogerty.  A se demander d'ailleurs s'il s'agit bien d'un album de ... John Fogerty!!
1,"Ce live n'est en aucun cas issu de tapes 1st gen comme assuré par les 3 doors restants. Les masters sont en la possession de Peter Abrams, patron du MAtrix et qui a enregistré deux soirs de concert sur trois, lequel n'a pas pu trouver d'arrangement financier avec les Doors (pure cupidité des membres restants ! )  Pour avoir pu comparer des extraits de ces master tapes et écouté ce double live : pas de comparaison possible : le son sur ce live n'est pas digne du pire des bootlegs en circulation, alors que le matériau original est fantastique ! Il ne sera certainement jamais réalisé pour le public... une honte !  Passez votre chemin et souvenez-vous : Money beats soul every time"
1,"PAUVRE MR JOHNSON ! CLAPTON LUI REND UN BIEN MEDIOCRE HOMMAGE. L'AUDITEUR EST ASSOURDI PAR LA BASSE ET ECRASE PAR LA BATTERIE. RIEN A VOIR AVEC LA LEGERETE ET LE DEPOUILLEMENT DES CHANSONS ENREGISTREES PAR ROBERT JOHNSON. POUR RETROUVER CET ESPRIT, IL VAUT MIEUX SE TOURNER VERS PETER GREEN QUI A ENREGISTRE LA TOTALITE DES 29 TITRES QUE NOUS A LAISSES MR JOHNSON, EN ETANT BEAUCOUP PLUS PROCHE DES ORIGINAUX. LA VERSION D'ERIC CLAPTON EST BRUYANTE, ASSOMMANTE, ET J'AI BEAUCOUP DE DIFFICULTES A ECOUTER CE DISQUE DANS SON INTEGRALITE. PERSONNELLEMENT JE DIS ""BEAUCOUP DE BRUIT POUR RIEN""."
5,"Amateur de Carlos Santana depuis toujours, ""MILAGRO"" est sans aucun doute pour moi un des meilleurs album qu'il a produit ces 20 dernières années.A conseiller et à écouter sans modération."
2,"Les musiciens sont peut-être les meilleurs de l'époque, il y a parfois de très bonnes idées. Mais dans l'ensemble, cet album produit une impression pénible. La musique est trop alambiquée et trop démonstrative."
1,"Tant mieux pour eux s'ils ont connu un succès mondial (pas étonnant dans ce monde où la vulgarité est reine), mais pour ma part je trouve leur musique absolument épouvantable. Quels attentats sonores que ces concerts de guitares qu'ils grattent comme des malades, à tel point qu'on se demande combien de fois ils ont dû faire péter les cordes... Je ne qualifierai pas ça de daube, la daube c'est de la musique plate, sans aspérités, un amas de notes qu'on dirait jetées au hasard, et je ne les accuse aucunement de platitude, juste de produire un ensemble de sons désagréables, une cacophonie absolument inécoutable à un point tel qu'à choisir je préfèrerais encore écouter Carla Bruni qui, elle, fait de la daube mais reposante, peut toujours être utile un soir d'insomnie. Messieurs, écoutez donc Nicolas Peyrac dans ""So far away"", vous verrez comment on joue de la guitare en caressant son instrument et non en le martyrisant, et comment on produit ainsi des sons harmonieux."
2,yo Slade ! ça ne fait que crier en jouant sur des casserolles....je préfère Rory Gallagher.... reste la voix phénoménale de Noddy Holder avec son timbre de gnome enragé ! du hard glitter qui est un peu dépassé. avis aux amateurs.
5,"voici, 31 ans après sa sortie, un album qui sonne à sa vraie valeur ! Avec notamment un Entangled dégageant une ambiance magique et un squonk ayant plus de relief. Tous les morceaux semblent différents, et pourtant, rien n'a été modifié, il s'agit simplement d'une histoire de volume sur les différentes pistes des instruments. On se rend compte désormais que les guitares sur ripples et entangled sont beaucoup plus riches que ce qu'on entendait jusqu'à présent, et carrément la présence d'un xylophone sur ce dernier. Des basses et des rythmes de batteries font leur apparition par ci par là et c'est vraiment bien réalisé. Déjà que l'album en stéréo est une merveille, je vous laisse découvrir ce que ça donne en 5.1."
5,"A Night at the Opera est indiscutablement l'album qui en 1975 va propulser Queen au premier rang des groupes de rock Anglo-saxons. Seulement 3 ans après leur premier album, les 4 compères ont pris une assurance certaines et nous déballent encore quelques merveilles : Death on two Legs, un règlement de compte agressif tout en musique avec -selon la rumeur- un de leurs anciens producteurs, I'm in Love with my Car chantée par Roger Taylor une ballade renversante de non-sens et de passion... Sweet lady est un bon morceau bien rock dans la lignée de Now I'm Here (sortie dans l'album précédent), une autre ballade à la guitare acoustique : 39', chantée par Brian May, semble rappeler le souvenir des anciens combattants.  Prophets' Song, comme dirait l'autre, fera lever quelques sourcils! En effet, cet interminable chanson est un surprenant mélange de Rock épique et agressif et de chants en canon et a capela... Il faut être Queen pour faire ça! On passe du style de Enio Morricone à celui de Trio Esperança!!! On enchaîne avec une chanson qui fera un carton dans les stades du monde entier : Love of my Life. Ici interprétée au piano (à la guitare 12 cordes en Live), c'est sans doute une des plus belles chansons d'amour que Queen ait jamais composée! Le dernier morceau marquant est un monument du rock, une oeuvre d'art époustouflante : Bohemian Rhapsody. Ce morceau sera élu morceau rock du siècle en Angleterre : un autre mélange de slow, d'opéra et de heavy metal. Bohemian rhapsody est pour beaucoup dans la qualité de cet album, une merveille. Belle conclusion tout de même que God Save the Queen mais c'est plutôt au groupe Queen qu'il faut faire la révérence!"
4,"Un des meilleur concert de Goldman avec des orchestrations magnifiques, des cuivres et une version de là-bas qui sonne comme un hommage à Sirima."
5,"Encore un excellent album de Paradise Lost , qui revient à ses origines un peu plus brutale, tout en gardant ce sens de la mélodie et la mélancholie qui lui est propre"
5,"Petite intro sur un sample, pour le moment rien de bien spÃ©cial, mais dÃs que l'intro se termine c'est l'apocalypse: un son monstrueux, une avalanche de bruits pour certains, un pur bonheur pour d'autres. Combien de mains a le batteur? Reste-t-il des cordes vocales au chanteurs?"
5,"Ce disque n'est pas à proprement parlé un album mais bien une collection des singles enregistrés par le King du temps de chez Sun. Les plus grands titres sont là (dont bien sûr, 'That's Alright'). Pour beaucoup aujourd'hui, Elvis, c'est d'abord une image avant une musique et pourtant, cette voix inimitable, cette musique qui, remise dans le contexte, allait tout changer et qui sonne encore tellement d'actualité font de ce disque un de ceux à posséder pour qui veut connaître le rock. Car si Presley n'a pas inventé le rock (Chuck Berry?), il l'a popularisé comme aucun autre."
4,"Lorsqu'il enregistre son premier album, en 1968, Randy Newman n'est pas vraiment un débutant : en effet, il est déjà très apprécié en tant que songwriter (interprété par Judy Collins, les Walker Brothers, Peggy Lee, Alan Price, Blood Sweat &amp; Tears, entre autres)."
1,Au regard de certains commentaires il semble évident qu'ils ne peuvent qu'être le reflet d'un manque de maturité voir d'ignorance. Même si le style de Richard Bona ne convient pas il n'en demeure pas moins qu'un excellent musicien et chanteur.
5,"Super music entendu la première fois à New York juillet 2000 Ils représentent le renouveau de la Pop Rock, cet album est très mélodieux, dommage qu'ils ne soient pas commues en France mais ils ne vont pas tarder.  A acheter d'urgence."
5,"Cet album est absolument génial. On y retrouve diverses influences pop rock, avec la sensibilité de l'artiste. Rythmé ou reposant, on ne se lasse pas de l'écouter... Que du bonheur pour les amateurs de pop, A consommer sans modération!!!"
5,"J'ai plusieurs CD d'Henri Dès, et le Beau Tambour est à mon avis l'un des meilleurs. Toutes les chansons sont très agréable à entendre. Rien ne doit être jeter dans ce CD."
1,"Encore plus nombreux que les Marx Brothers mais nettement moins drôles les Jacksons ont tenté avec ce « Victory » le hold-up planétaire. Mais l'honneur (musical) est sauf : ce disque a été un (relatif) échec vu les « objectifs » délirants en terme de chiffre de vente prévus. Il faut dire que surtout, il est loin d'être génial. Tout commence au début des années 70, avec les Jackson 5, devenus plus tard les Jacksons, une famille de frères chanteurs américains à grand succès. Au tournant des années 80, le « groupe » éclate et les carrières solo démarrent. L'une d'entre elles aura un « certain » retentissement, celle du plus jeune frère Jackson, Michael. Pour profiter du succès intergalactique de « Thriller », le groupe de frangins est reconstitué, avec objectif semi-avoué de Epic-Sony la maison de disques, faire aussi bien que « Thriller ». Pour cela, il aurait fallu de bonnes chansons, ce qui n'est pas le cas ici ; tout au long de ces huit titres, on a affaire à un disco-funk comme les studios américains en débitent au kilomètre, avec une paire d'obligatoires ballades gluantes à la Lionel Richie. A noter qu'après un Beatle (McCartney sur « Thriller »), c'est au tour d'un Rolling Stone (Mick Jagger) de venir prêter allégeance au nouveau roi de la pop pour un duo (« State of shock ») qui ne restera pas dans les annales comme une réussite. « Victory ». Ou comment perdre son âme en voulant la victoire à tout prix."
1,"Et pourtant dieu sait mon adoration pour Paul que je considère comme le plus grand artiste du 20ème siècle... mais là, il touchait le fond avec des chansons bâclées, un son épouvantable, et une voix déformée à l'extrême qui ne venait rien arranger... Seules Waterfall et One of These Days sortent du médiocre, mais cela ne sauve pas l'album du naufrage. Sur la pochette, Macca précise qu'il a joué de tous les instruments et produit l'album lui-même à la maison. Ce que l'égocentrisme peut nous faire faire comme inepties... Heureusement, après cette expérience fâcheuse, le meilleur était à venir à peine un an plus tard avec Tug of War..."
5,Klaus avait une voix et un talent tel que personne ne peut y rester indifférent. Un précurseur que je vous invite à découvrir.
5,"Jusqu'à maintenant adepte de Diana Krall, accro. à Norah Jones,  fan de Lisa Ekdahl et aussi fidèle à Marla Glen... je viens de découvrir l'album ""Another Day"" de Molly Johnson et sans aucun doute je l'ajoute à ma play-list des voix qui swinguent. Que du bonheur !"
4,"Cet album est un retour de forme - ainsi que ""Dot Com"" de 1999 - expliqué par une inspiration de bonnes mélodies telles qu'ont les aiment dans des albums comme ""Broasword and the Beast"" ou ""Minstrels in the Gallery 1975"". Les concerts sont plutot réussis (Olympia en france) et sur cet album seule la dernière chanson est un peu faible car trop Dire Strait ( pour certain c'est déjà pas mal ! )."
2,"Ce 'Concert in central park' est évidemment mythique... On trouve (presque) toutes les chansons incontournables du duo plus des succès en solo et une version de ""Wake up little Suzie""... La carrière solos des duettistes déclinant, ils se sont dit qu'un 'Simon &amp; Garfunkel Revival'  leur ferait du bien, ce qui a été le cas... Reste qu'ils se sont (re-) brouillés ensuite... Enfin je n'ai jamais été une fan des lives puisqu'on y retrouve souvent des versions des chansons d'albums qui sont inférieures à celles de studio... Je vais me contredire car, comme d'autres bêtes de scènes, Simon et Garfunkel soit en duo soit en solo ont eu l'art de faire quelques versions live supérieures à celles enregistrées auparavant en studio...   Reste qu'en 81, ils ont suffisamment bourlingué (comprendre 'ils sont vieux') et n'ont plus la voix de leur 25 ans... Alors autant un album 'en concert' de S&amp;G de 1968 ou 1969 serait une véritable pépite autant ce concert nous rend nostalgique... de leurs harmonies vocales d'antan."
5,"Comme d'habitude, j'ai lu les avis des internautes, à la premmière écoute, j'avoue avoir été décu ! J'ai mis le CD de côté pendant de longs mois, en me disant que cela n'était pas possible, qu'autant d'internautes aient pu se tromper autant ! Je l'ai écouté a nouveau avec beaucoup d'attention et là grande surprise !!! C'est moi qui m'étais trompé une belle voix, une bonne orchestration. Un album d'une grande douceur ! Merci a tous les internautes encore une fois pour leurs différents avis"
1,"Le groupe The Servant s'était imposé dans la très surchargée )et donc difficile d'accès) scene pop rock. tout le monde se souvient du titre Orchestra qui a résonné dans nos têtes plusieurs mois durant. Hop hop, vite j'écoute le nouvel opus : les bras m'en tombent...fade, fade, et fade. Rien ne permet de me reveiller, je m'ennuie, et je finis vite par ranger le cd dans sa boite, avec la ferme intention de le laisser. Une deuxieme écoute s'impose cependant, pire que la première. Les textes sont niais, l'instrumentation chaotique...Vers le déclin, the servant?"
5,"Ce troisième album est génial. Les titres Spitting games, chocolate et run sont super. Leurs musiques sont un mélange de mélodies et de sons acérés. L'inspiration et la hargne du chanteur/gitariste Gary (il a composé la plupart des morceaux et chanté sur presque tous les titres) , font de cet album un album excellent. Snow patrol se démarque des autres groupes. Alors pour ceux qui aiment le pop/rock alternatif jettez vous dessus sans retenue, vous ne serez pas décu!"
5,"Dans la foulée de l'Expédition nos amis du Quebec nous font la bonne surprise d'enchaîner avec un deuxième opus qui vaut lui aussi le détour. Les accents sont moins graves que sur l'album précédent. Les textes et les mélodies sont plus joyeux et légers et l'on a le plaisir de découvrir de nouveaux personnages (Titi Tancrède et le Beau-Frère) ou de continuer la saga de certains autres comme Jipi Labrosse et Gina Pinard. Cependant, avec nos ""Cowboys"" il ne faut jamais se fier aux apparences et ils ont placé au milieu de leur titres joyeux des morceaux engagés et sociaux tels que : ""Pittoresque"", ""Au pays des sapins géants"" et ma préférée ""Par chez nous"". En résumé un très bon album qui complète à merveilles leurs productions précédentes et que l'on dégustera avec plaisir en live."
4,"Un album qui revient aux sources de ce qui a fait le succès de Madonna, avec un son toutefois plus moderne, moins pop, plus techno. Une Madonna en pleine forme qui chante sur quelques reprises (la mélodie de ""Hung Up"" me rappelle quelque chose mais je ne sais plus quoi). Avec ""Get Together"" aussi, on a l'impression, à l'intro, de revenir sur un de ses morceaux 20 ans en arrière mais très vite, bascule sur une musique rythmée des années 2000. Vraiment, Madonna est étonnante dans ce mariage de musique/son moderne avec un background parfois rétro. Super !"
5,Je suis plutôt adepte de musique tranquille même si je ne crache pas sur Sinclair ou Daft Punk... Mais là !
5,"En 1983 l'amerique officielle boude Joan Baez qui pourtant triomphe en Europe,illuminant Paris lors d'un gigantesque concert à la Concorde.Elle sort aussi ce superbe live,jumeau d'un autre excellent disque sorti 2 ans auparavant et également enregistré en Europe.Celui ci est supérieur.Les climats sont plus variés,les accompagnements sobres mettent pleinement en valeur la voix critalline et argentée,souple et veloutée.""farewell angelina"" trouve un second soffle,""hard rain""est plus poignant que dans l'original de 66,et elle y imite Dylan de maniere hilarante.Parmi les petits joyaux j'adore""love inside"",bien meilleur que la version de Sreisand.Terminons avec l'hymne ""sacco et vanzetti""  avant un époustouflant spiritual ""land of thousand dansers"" qui met le public en transe.Un disque exemplaire de la Madonne ,qui restitue pleinement l'ambiance des ses meilleurs concerts."
5,"J'ai été très satisfaite, la commande est arrivée en très bon état, neuf... Vendeur sérieux!!"
5,"Un disque référence, une sorte de london calling des annees 80: 19 titres sans faiblesse remplis de rage et d'un veritable talent d'auteurs compositeurs - intrepretes... La reference aux clash est constante mais loin d'etre un plagiat elle demeure une preuve de bon gout. Formidable."
2,"Apres avoir entendu le mythe ""pornography"" je pensais que the cure allé nous sortir un tres grand album . Mais la deception fut grande .Mais je mets quand meme 2 étoiles car certaines chansons sont sympas (caterpillar).Si vous aimez l'ambiance de the cure e vous conseille d'acheter pornography,faith ou disintegration"
5,C'est album est une tuerie de bout en bout !! Jamais une musique ne m'aura autant donné la peche que celle d'Andrew !! PARTY HARD !!!
5,"Après une carrière sans faille, le groupe opère un tournant radical pour se tourner vers quelque chose de plus pop, mais toujours aussi frais et déjanté. Cet album conclue une carrière trop courte certes, mais dont certains préretraités du rock devraient s'inspirer. Ou comment atteindre une certaine forme d'immortalité..."
5,"Grand fan de SY, cet album est mon préféré.  Crissement de guitare, basse enorme,rythmiques presque tribales. Malgré cela la mélodie l'emporte, les paroles sont le plus souvent scandées et cet opus ressemble à un chaos maitrisé. Certains passages de cet album ne quitteront jamais mon esprit, et je conseille vraiment cet album très sous-estimé.  Pour la petite histoire Paul Smith, alors artiste à Londres, a spécialement créé un label (BlastFirst) pour que ce disque puisse être commercialisé. Si je ne vous ai pas convaincu avec ca ..."
5,"Je ne suis pas ""fan"" de Sonyc Youth car je n'aime pas ce terme mais jamais je n'ai écouté un groupe si longtemps, avec cette même curiosité á les écouter et á deviner la prochaine étape de leur évolution. Je suis donc prêt à appuyer sur ""play"", face á un album que je ne connais pas et avec toujours la même appréhension: ce sont- ils désormais envoler définitivement vers les hautes sphéres sans fond du free Jazz, de la musique expérimental, de la balade cowboys aux sons atmosphériques ou des trois á la fois? Est-ce que je vais encore les comprendre et les voir garder cette instinct rock qui m'est si cher ou leur curiosité maladive pour l'original va t'elle enfin les emmener sur des sentiers encore plus lointain? Pas rassuré, j'écoute d'un traite le CD. Premiére impréssion, comme á chaque fois: c'est plus lent que la derniére fois, plus mélancolique..ca y'est!Ils se sont ramolis! Je réecoute et doucement commence á comprendre, á apprécier et .......á réecouter.......comme d'habitude! Il y a plus d'espaces, plus de simplicité apparente et un quelquechose de folk, de plus ""américain"".Mais la mélodie est toujours là, les arpéges toujours aussi originaux et parfaitement structurés, les sons trés calibrés et la rythmique de la plus haute importance.Parler des chansons une par une? Désolé, j'peux pas, chez SY, un album est un tout, rempli de choses différentes, l'humeur d'une année passée á se renouveller, une séance de méditation , exigente et besogneuse. Les SY sont toujours lá avec cette album et vous hypnotiseront encore, sans ennui et sans répétition, toujours sur le fil du rasoir entre rock et musique conceptuelle mais sans jamais choisir un camp.........pas de risque de faire un mauvais achat donc!"
2,"David Bowie signe des albums de plus en plus ""ordinaires"". Reality est du domaine du ""aussitôt écouté, aussitôt oublié"". Provenant d'un artiste lambda, on trouverait ça sympatoche sans plus, mais de la part d'un artiste aussi prestigieux que Bowie, auteur-compositeur-interprête de génie, c'est tout simplement une déchéance!..  Un Bowie sage qui se repose sur une croisière de rock fm plus ou moins digeste."
1,"L'album est bien, les titres sont bons et le DVD est très bien foutu, mais en ce concerne le mix 5.1 SACD, c'est de la vulgaire stéréo élargie, ça marche bien avec les images mais autant acheter le cd normal en stéréo, le 5.1 n'existe pas."
2,"Madonna continue sans lasser puisque elle essaie de changer de style à chaque fois. Pas son style perso, avec ses airs coquins, non !, de style musical ! La prod est toujours soignée, logique la prod est friquée et ça tape toujours juste pour bien vendre. Cela étant, d'autres artistes et d'autres producteurs arrivent à faire des trucs plus innovants que cet album, sans parler d'une couverture médiatique lourde qui fait de Madonna un produit de consommation courante que vous trouverez sans peine dans votre hyper."
1,"Le dernier album de Madonna (Hard Candy) pourrait être qualifié de ""... de gueule"" : une pochette d'un vulgaire rare, des rythmes dignes d'un mauvais synthétiseur et des paroles réduites au minimum. A vouloir s'attaquer à tous les styles, Madonna finit par sombrer dans le médiocre (la pire chanson étant Spanish Lesson où les faux airs de guitare font pitié). Aucune des douzes chansons ne sort de cette mare de médiocrité, et pour cause, Madonna est devenue un produit de consommation bas de gamme. Album très très mauvais. Dommage, j'étais fan."
5,"Inutile de préciser que cet album est au panthéon du rock! et pour cause : une véritable Merveille qui a vu s'épanouir la musique du CLASH! 19 titres fondamentaux! du rock, du jazz, du ska, du reggae...on danse, on S'ECLATE, on rêve, on AIME! Quant à la vidéo, elle contient des images d'archives rares, vous faisant regretter de ne pas posséder de machine à remonter le temps. On dit merci qui ? Merci Guy Stevens! Merci le CLASH! MERCI Joe, MERCI Mick, MERCI Paul, MERCI Nicky!!!"
5,"Gaucher mais pas gauche l'ancien bassiste des scarabées. Ce mélodiste hors paire réussit un album rock intemporel. Entouré de Steve Miller, Richard Starkey (connu sous le sobriquet de Ringo Starr) ""Really love you"", du 5ème Beatles George martin ""Somedays ; Beautiful night"" et de Jeff Lynne (Electric Light Orchestra), Flaming Pie est le fruit d'une intarrissable source d'inspiration et d'un talent indémodable."
1,"Ben oui, c'est leur plus mauvais album, rien a dire, rien a retenir a part peut etre le morceau qui lui donne le titre et encore........................"
2,"j'attendais avec impatience le nouveau ac-dc apres les fabuleux ""highway to hell"",et""back in black"".j'ecoute donc ""for those about to rock""et ca commence tres fort avec le titre de l'album,et arrive ""put the finger on you""superbe,suivie de"" let's get it up"" et la je me dit il nous refons le coup de"" back in black"" que des bombes a chaque titres,et puis patatra!!! le reste ne decolle jamais.Au final un album frustrant."
5,"Eh oui ils sont forts les motley crue,forts d'une carrière emblématique de 25 ans.Et cet album balance sévère avec notamment 2 titres punk-métal fabuleux:""face down in the dirt"" et ""saints of Los angeles"".Après 8 ans d'absence c'est un vrai bonheur de les voir sortir un disque de 1er ordre.Une longevité au premier plan qui en font pour moi un des 5 plus grands groupes de tous les temps"
1,"""Jailbreak"", ""Johnny the Fox"", ""Bad Reputation"" : voila la mince Lizzy lancée à fond dans son époque (enfin). Sa Deuxième époque, en fait. Elle culminera avec ""Live &amp; Dangerous"" avant une apothéose studio en forme de feu(x) d'artifices ad libitum : ""Renegade"", ""Black Rose"", Chinatown"", ""Thunder and Lightning"". Hélas, Je ne sais pas ce qui s'est passé, mais ce live ne rend pas du tout hommage à la formidable force de frappe du gang de Lynott, pourtant capable de nous faire perdre la tête sur un coup de riff lumineux. Quel dommage de sombrer ainsi... Défunitivement."
2,"aprés une intense créativité dans les 70, lynott et sa bande nous propose CHINATOWN, un album trés inégal...  cet album est décevant, on a à faire à du hard (fm) sans saveur, des refrains bateau, le feeling s'en est allé,  cet album est trés mal produit, mais bon c'est surtout l'inspiration qui n'est pas au rendez-vous. les titres (chinatown),(didn't I) et (genocide) sauvent cet album, les titres (sugar blues) et (killer on the loose) sont sympathiques mais pas transcendants. mais le reste est plus que dispensable. heureusement la bande se reprend avec renegade et thunder and lightning (qui sont trés différents de ce qu'ils ont fait dans les 70 mais c'est de qualité). J'ai modifié un peu mon commentaire vu les réactions succités, je n'ai en aucun cas voulu démonté chinatown et encore moins thin lizzy qui est un de mes groupes favoris. j'ai juste donné mon avis, il est peut-être minoritaire mais c'est mon avis, j'ai été déçu par cet album, c'est tout. J'ai malgré tout réécouté l'album et j'ai peut-être été trop vite à chroniquer chinatown.J'ai fait quelques changements (positifs). Mais désolé mon avis général ne change pas, cet album est moyen pour moi (2,5/5).Pour ceux qui ne connaissent pas, je conseille de commencer par un autre album de thin lizzy."
5,"Le meilleur de Cannibal Corpse incontestablement! L'album qui fait prendre un tournant plus technique dans la carrière du groupe de death le plus culte et le plus méritant qui existe.Une perle à découvrir ou redécouvrir en recommandant les excellentes ""Stripped,Raped And Strangled"" ou ""The Pick-Axes Murders"" ou encore une prouesse technique digne de virtuoses ""Return To The Flesh"" mais honnêtement,il serait dur de se prononcer pour la meilleure chanson de cet album,qui est à lui seul LE cd de death-metal à posséder chez soi."
4,"Apres avoir lu ou entendu de nombreuses critiques négatives concernant cet album je ne m'etais jamais décidé à l'acheter, mais voila vu que c'etait le seul album de Mayhem à ne pas avoir j ai décidé de franchir le pas. Et la... je me suis dis ""c est vrai qu il est pas terrible""....Mais en le réécoutant on se mets à  l'apprecier et à dénicher de véritable perles comme ""a grand declaration of war"", ""in the lies where upon you lay"" et surtout oui surtout le magnifique ""completion in science of agony"" rien que pour ce titre le cd vaut le coup d etre acheter, un chef d'oeuvre. Certes la voix claire de Maniac est peut etre trop mise en avant ce qui déroute pour un album de black metal mais on y prend vite gout notemment sur les titres précédement cités. Bon il y a aussi des titres pour boucher les trous, comme un titre un peu électro assez pitoyable, qui n'a absolument rien a faire sur un cd de Mayhem mais bon..... Ce a grand declaration n'est certe pas le meilleur album de Mayhem, il n'a pas l'intensité, la froideur le coté morbide et malsain des autres albums qui ont précédés ou ont suivis mais il reste un bon album dont les avis négatifs ne sont pas pleinement justifiés."
1,"oui la honte du rock français, aucune âme, aucune originalité, rien ne sort de ce disque. Produit formaté par les tendances actuelles et les maisons de disques. Paroles mièvres et naives à souhait, de quoi faire frémir tout ados..."
5,comment faire pour vous procurer un pur son pop - rock ? le CD dont vous ne serez pas deçus d'avoir. si je vous dis kyo vous me ditent...meilleure musique. vous n'aurez pas trouvé mieux. c'est l'album de l' année et en plus ils assurent grave ! ces 4 gars vous prouvent à travers leurs paroles qu'on peut toucher les coeurs des français mais aussi qu'ils savent faire de la musique grâce à leurs guitares. que demander de plus que ça?! ils sont largement à la hauteur de ce qu'on recherchait dans le rock et comptent bien durer encore et encore des années à venir !
4,"...par petites touches, mais le résultat est là et bien là. C'est ici que l'on trouve les premiers vrais tubes de Depeche Mode en France (People are people et surtout Master &amp; servant) et on comprend pourquoi car l'album est presque parfait. Des tubes incontournables que même si vous les mettez à fond la caisse aujourd'hui, nos bambins actuels s'éclateront dessus, faites le test, moi je l'ai fait et ça n'a pas manqué. Même les titres qui n'ont pas été des singles sont dansants et percutants (Something to do, Stories of old) Mais plus rien n'est innocent ici, Depeche Mode s'attaque à la politique (Master &amp; servant, Lie to me), à la religion (Blasphemous Rumours) et s'amuse à intégrer des sous-entendus sexuels un peu partout comme dans tous les prochains albums du groupe.  La pochette montre bien qu'il s'agit ici du bon mariage entre leur pop synthétique habituelle avec quelques touches de contestation, leur style est né ici. Il faut savoir également que l'album devait s'appeler à l'origine Perversions (et ce titre lui va si bien) mais DM avait eu peur à l'époque que les parents refusent d'acheter le disque à leurs enfants s'il portait un titre pareil alors que Some Great Reward (une sacrément bonne récompense) et même la pochette font plus innocent, mais ne vous y trompez pas. Ici commence bel et bien le bon vrai son du meilleur groupe pop des années 80/90 et un de leurs premiers album incontournables."
2,"Ca y est, Genesis est devenu ce monstre à 3 têtes qui remplit d'ores déjà des stades entiers, ce disque n'est surtout pas un album de transition, c'est un document. Un document sur une époque et ses artistes-rois. A ce sujet, ""American psycho"" de Bret Easton Ellis fait un portrait très juste du groupe. Malgré ça, ""That's all"" reste assez écoutable, ""Mama"" garde son côté bizarre. Quant au reste, il est tout à fait correct sur le plan stylistique, mais pou la musique, c'est autre chose."
2,"Pour être crédible il faut éviter de dire que c'est toujours génialissime. Coldplay est un bon groupe de pop, très sympa en concert, et qui a déjà commis 2 albums qui comptent. Mais là il faut avoir l'honnêteté de reconnaître que c'est plutôt râté. D'accord c'est du Coldplay, la voix de Chris Martin est là, mais l'album ne prend aucun risque. Quelques titres (square one, speed of sound, twisted logic) surnagent à peine de la SOUPE générale. On ne retrouve aucun morceau de l'épaisseur de God put a smile upon my face, Clocks ou Politik. Tout se ressemble et rien ne dépasse. Décevant !"
4,"Chaque nouvelle production du duo Autechre est très attendue, puisqu'ils ont créé un langage qui leur est propre, une voie unique dans la musique électronique. Ce cinquième album utilise les mêmes principes que les précédents : rythmes complexes et destructurés - ou accumulation extrèmement bien structurée de rythmes simples ? -, lambeaux de mélodies (de retour dans ce nouvel album), et du son partout, divers, accumulé, concassé, comme du Pierre Schaeffer hip-hop. Quelques curiosités dans ce ""LP5"" : ""Melve"", comptine d'une minute ; ""Fold4, wrap5"" tentative pour un morceau balnéaire qui ne commence jamais ; ""Calliper remote"" : c'est rigolo d'entrechoquer des tôles dans le désert ; ""Arch carrier"", électro lyrique et nostalgique (le premier morceau d'Autechre avec des violons ! Un peu comme le Aphex Twin/Philip Glass) ; ""Drane2"" et ses 23 minutes de tristesse contemporaine (dont 12 silencieuses). Et enfin le génial ""Vose in"", condensé de tout ce qui fait le génie du groupe : l'agonie des machines, c'est la nôtre. Derrière tout cela plane parfois l'ombre de Richard D. James (Aphex Twin), pour un album plus varié que les précédents donc presque inégal : moins percutant que   et plus accessible que  , soleils d'acier de leur discographie irréprochable. La pochette est un peu décevante : les boitiers noirs anonymes, on a déjà vu ça chez d'autres. Mais cela convient bien à leur recherche d'une abstraction toujours plus forte. Autechre : le seul groupe de techno qui plaît aux fans de Luc Ferrari, DMX Krew, Current 93 et Laurent Garnier en même temps. Et à tous ceux qui veulent écouter un truc incroyable."
5,Album deep house par excellence. Incomprehensible qu'il ne soit pas plus connu. La premiere chanson Baghdad Café est sur toutes les compil du monde. Et la fin de l'album est tout simplement prodigieuse. A posseder absolument que vous soyez fan de house ou de lounge.
5,"Un album magnifique , pratiquement aussi fort et beau que ""I am a bird now"" , qu'il annonce : ""twilight"" , ""cripple and the starfish"" , ""river of sorrow"" ""rapture"" ( sublimes ) ou ""blue angel"" ( magnifique ! ) sont vraiment dans la même lignée ... Les revendications ""transgenre"" ne sont pas aussi clairement exprimées que dans l'album suivant , si ce n'est la pochette et l'hommage rendu à Divine qu'il nomme ""Mother of America"" . Cependant , les paroles et la voix angélique de notre Drama Queen révèlent de manière implicite la position ""entre deux"" et la souffrance qui va avec cet état si particulier ( on voit d'ailleurs antony chanter au début du film ""Wild Side"" qui évoque ce sujet de manière très honnête ) ... Un très bel album , vraiment , que j'estime pour ma part supérieur à ""The Crying light"" ."
5,"1968. Françoise Hardy est désormais une femme. Elle l'avait magnifiquement chanté dans son album précédent, Ma Jeunesse fout l'Camp. Illustré par Jean-Paul Goude, ce disque-ci est très éclectique et témoigne du goût sûr de l'artiste, aucune de ces chansons n'ayant vieilli. Au contraire. Qualité des textes, interprétation sensible tout en finesse, sobriété de l'accompagnement musical, subtilité, l'émotion est une fois de plus au rendez-vous. On retiendra particulièrement les titres de Gainsbourg, les reprises de Joan Baez et Leonard Cohen, de Sabia, le poème d'Aragon et l'humour de la chanson de Modiano/Courson (auteurs e.a. de la très rare A cloche-pied sur la grande muraille de Chine). Le sommet de l'album est peut-être Il vaut mieux une petite maison dans la main..., que l'on doit au duo Rivière/Bourgeois (L'Amitié, Rendez-vous d'automne...)."
4,"Les critiques ci et là ont largement dénigré un album qui sort des sentiers battus de Marillion. D'accord, on est loin dans le style de Script, Misplaced et les autres productions de l'ère Fish. Mais on n'est pas si éloigné que ça de Seasons. Disons plutôt que Holidays est dans la logique du virage amorcé par cette première mouture de l'ère Hogart. Alors sacrilège parce que cela sonne trop pop ? Perso, je considère que cet écart est plutôt réussi. Style à part, la majorité des morceaux propose une musique souvent nerveuse, toujours limpide et mélodique avec la voix sublime de H, avec par exemple Splintering heart, Holidays... Et le trio This town/The rakes progress/100 nights - résolument prog - nous rappelle d'où vient Marillion, mais nous indique également où il va. Alors en parcourant les différents sites spécialisés prog, on constate que Holidays est souvent l'album le plus déconsidéré. Tout ça parce que Marillion a fait un pas de côté, a sans doute voulu se rappeler au bon souvenir des charts (sans trop de réussite d'ailleurs)... C'est un peu cher payé. Un bon groupe doit savoir sortir de son pré carré, quitte à troubler son auditoire habituel. Marillion l'a fait et avec brio !"
5,"Cet album est un veritable chef-d'oeuvre à reserver au oreilles avertis et au fan de Marillion, je pense que L'AUDITEUR DE NANTERRE ,n'a pas bien ecouté cet album c'est la referance periode STEVE HOGARTH.Cet album est tres inspiré et tres noir ,  les compos sont magnifiques ,entre autres je pense à ;the great escape ..........quel plaisir."
2,"Comment écouter cet album ? En tant que tel en feignant de se souvenir de ce que le groupe a su produire auparavant ? Difficile, et tout le drame est là, tant les Stones semblent ici rechercher dans divers styles (60', rock, ballades, folk) la grâce et l'étincelle géniale de la fin des années 60 et du début de seventies. Love is Strong est un morceau plutôt bien balancé mais on est très très loin de la fulgurance d'un Bitch ou d'un Brown Sugar... Il illustre à lui seul ce que ne seront plus jamais les Stones : un groupe de rock'n roll dangereux, spontané et provoquant. Un album largement dispensable avec à suivre l'une des tournées les plus catastrophiques des Stones musicalement parlant."
1,"Un album satisfaisant après les catastrophiques Emotional Rescue, Undercover et Dirty Work. Trop long cependant, ce disque aurait mérité d'être allégé de 5 titres. Anybody seen est d'un ennui mortel, on est loin des percutants ""Brow Sugar"" ou même ""Start me up"", dernier bon single des cailloux."
2,"A part Over you rien n'est magique comme ce à quoi le groupe nous avait habitué. Auto dérision de Ferry, mièvreries et pannes d'idées.  Ce n'est pas un bon album, les chansons ne sortent pas de l'anecdotique et ne se distinguent pas, c'est paresseux et vain. tant pis il faudra se contenter des albums précedents. la veine créative de Roxy est épuisée. C'était un grand groupe."
2,"Paroles simplettes, rock de girls band des années 80 à la Pat Benatar, un riff pour les trois quarts de l'album...C'est ça Garbage? En effet."
5,"Testament dans lequel AIC nous expose 1 dernière fois sa vision du rock des 90 : savant mélange de ""grunge"" et de metal tordu où Layne (RIP) chante sublimement sa vision de la vie... culte! (tout comme le reste de la discographie)"
5,"Si ""Facelift"" était fondateur et reste la base du groupe, coup de bol pour les fans : ""Dirt"" remet le couvert et double la mise. On n'a pas 1 album historique, on en a 2... Eh oui, car ""Dirt"" se hisse bel et bien au niveau du génial ""Facelift"" sans aucun souci, toujours à la frontière du métal et du grunge, mais bien plus intéressant que les merdeux hirsutes de Seattle produisant une pseudo-musique négativiste. Certes ici l'ambiance n'est pas à la liesse, mais la qualité musicale est exceptionnelle : ""Dirt"" possède l'aura des véritables albums cultes, des véritables artistes qui ont quelque chose à dire. Moralité : si vous ne devez retenir que 2 cd d'Alice in Chains, ceux-ci ne peuvent être que Dirt et Facelift. Sans conteste..."
2,"Eh oui... avec tout ma bonne volonté, je ne vois qu'une parole me venir à la bouche : ""Quel gâchis !"" En effet, c'est avec l'immense nostalgie de Rage Against The Machine que j'ai écouté cet album terriblement décevant, voire insultant à l'égard des groupes dont sont issus les membres d'Audioslave. RATM, ça c'était un groupe ! L'énorme virtuosité de Tom, Tim et Brad et le chant ""hip-hop / hurlements"" à lourde charge politique de Zack... Zack, où es-tu quand on a besoin de toi ?!..."
1,"je suis un fan de longue date de soundgarden, temple of the dog et de la voix de chris cornell (brillante sur son excellent premier opus solo) et je déplore le virage à 180° que Chris est en train de prendre avec cet album pourrave de merdes pour magasins de fringues. Rendez-nous du grunge, des guitares et de vrais musiciens. Après Timbaland, ce sera quoi la prochaine fois : un album produit par Moby ? Ou un disque de covers de Britney Spears avec tout le gratin des Grammy awards ??? Je suis dégoûté... Le seul avantage d'Internet est d'avoir pu écouter ce truc sur MySpace avant de l'acheter ! Fans inconditionnels, fuyez !"
5,"nirvana, vous pensiez connaitre?? et comme ça à froid, certains d'entres vous disait comme moi, "" je n'aime pas nirvana""....en fait je ne connaissais pas nirvana, enfin, pas tout....et c'est sans compter la mauvaise presse du groupe à une certaine époque qui n'a pas donner envie de connaitre d'avantage....comme quoi, ça me conforte dans mon idée qu'il ne faut pas écouter ce que les gens racontent....il faut toujours se faire sa propre opinion...et la mienne est que cet album est vraiment super, j'y ai découvert des titres que j'aimais entendre , et dont je ne savais que c'était nirvana qui les interprétait...vous savez ces trucs qu'on aime bien à la radio...et dont on dit "" c'est qui ça?""...et bien c'est NIRVANA(entre autre), alors si vous aussi aviez comme moi , des a priori sur ce groupe, donnez vous au moins la peine d'écouter les extraits, et je suis sure que vous allez dire aussi "" waou!! mais? c'est eux qui chantait ça ???"" INCROYABLE NON?"
5,"Si l'Unplug de Nirvana a surtout tourné en boucle pour être présenté comme le testament de Kurt Cobain, c'est surtout l'occasion de se rendre compte à quel point se cachait derrière les guitares saturées du groupe et la voix torturée de Cobain, un sens de la mélodie et de la composition peut-être inédit depuis... les Beatles. Cobain n'y pouvait rien, il composait des magnifiques chansons, porteuses d'une rage d'une folle intensité, qu'elles soient déclinés par ses guitares rock ou, comme on le constate ici, portées par sa simple voix et des instruments dans leur plus grand dénuement. A l'arrivée, c'est surtout cela qui restera du groupe de Seatlle: des titres indémodables pour le meilleur groupe de rock de la décennie 90, parti bien trop tôt."
1,"j'ai tout les opus des Guns, et celui ci est celui que j'ai le moins aimé ... je me demande vraiment l'interet, car apres l'avoir ecouté et réécouté, je n'accroche toujours pas, donc plutot se tourner vers un autre album pour decouvrir le groupe ."
2,"Ah, qu'il est loin, le bon vieux temps du blues des 2 premiers, du rock de Making Movies et du planant de Love over gold"". Maintenant, c'est du son formaté FM (Money for nothing), des (très) grandes longueurs (Why worry), (Ride across the river), ainsi que le ridicule ""Walk of life"" et l'horreur ""One world"". Le morçeau titre est à proprement parler un gâchis: Mark Knopfler montre qu'il est digne héritier de Gilmour, mais il le fait sur un morçeau long, plat et totalement insipide. De toute façon, cela ne vaudra jamais un ""Where do ya think you're going"", du bon vieux temps ou ils etaient 2 grands guitaristes. ""So far away"" passe à la rigueur, mais le seul titre à peu près digne du Grand Dire Straits est ""The man's too strong"". Sinon, le reste et pitoyable et incontestablement le pire de Dire Straits (Avis apparemment peu partagé!) mais ""On every street"" viendra relever le niveau, moins surfait et plus inspiré que cette bouse avant le final en apothéose du live ""On the Night""."
5,"... en 1993, a la sortie de l album, un concours était organisé en France dont le gagnant était le 1er a donner le nombre exact de Spaghetis sur la pochette. Le vainqueur se voyait offrir le prochain album du groupe. Autant dire que le malheureux qui s est usé les yeux (et les illusions ;-) ) a ce petit jeu doit encore attendre.... comme des millions d'autres fans de par le monde."
2,"Grosse déception à la première écoute, qui s'estompe un peu avec le temps, mais la gêne reste : ce nouvel album sonne exactement comme le précédent. La batterie en particulier a exactement le même son, on croit reconnaitre des titres de Brand New Day (et les moins bons à mon goût, de plus) à chaque piste. Mêmes intonnations, mêmes rythmes... Où est le Sting des premiers albums solo ??? Enfin, ça se laisse écouter... malgré tout."
2,"Honnêtement, en tant qu'amateur de la musique de ce groupe, j'ai toujours pensé que ""Close To The Edge"" était un album vraiment surévaluer. Le morceau titre est inutilement tarabiscoté et pas très inspiré, tandis que 'And You And I' verse dans la mièvrerie. Seul 'Siberian Khatru' est un morceau qui tire son épingle du jeu, mais 8mn pour un album de 38mn, ça fait peu, non?  Pour un néophyte qui voudrait découvrir Yes, cet album n'est franchement pas à conseiller en premier! plutôt commencer par ""The Yes Album"", ""Fragile"" ou même ""Relayer"". Les 2 étoiles sont là pour 'Siberian Khatru'."
5,"un tres bon groupes US, le son du (heavy-metal)des années 70 est bien present.bon cd a plus"
2,"après l'impact colossal du premier album, ce deuxième contient beaucoup moins de chansons fortes... Il y a évidemment d'excellents moments (""Light Up The Sky"" ""Outta Love"" ""Dance The Night Away""...) Un album en dents de scie"
5,"Voilà... 4 mots qui résument bien cet album : 1er opus du groupe, et qui reste à ce jour la meilleure de leurs livraisons, cette galette transpire la hargne, la rage de vaincre, l'amour du trash, la furie maîtrisée, l'envie d'en découdre. Car en plus d'être un monument du trash moderne, ""Burn my Eyes"" a établi d'un seul coup un nouveau son, LE son Machine Head, sec, brut, avec ses petits larsens de Flying V, et monstrueusement puissant, renforcé par une section rythmique en éton armé, et possédant qui plus est une aura inexplicable mais certaine. Pour ne rien gâcher, et c'est même la marque des seigneurs, ce disque est ultra-inspiré, composé de titres tous devenus des hymnes en live : les désormais cultes ""Davidian"", ""Thousand Lies"", ""Old"", ""Death Church"", et j'en passe, qui sont tous d'imparrables missiles allant droit au but, instantanément mémorisables, incroyablement percutants. Voilà un disque qui mérite amplement le qualificatif de CHEF D'OEUVRE, sans une seconde d'hésitation ! A ranger aux cotés des meilleurs Slayer, Metallica, Grip Inc, Anthrax, Megadeth... QUELLE CLAQUE !!!"
5,"Lorsque la plupart des punks, en 1978/1979, comprit que leur combat était voué à l'échec, la rage et la colère contenues dans leur musique disparurent peu à peu. A Manchester, ville sinistre et grise d'Angleterre, 4 jeunes punks nommés Warsaw transformèrent leur nom en Joy Division. Ian Curtis, parolier et chanteur, être à la sensibilité extrême, menait le groupe. Leur musique se laissait aller vers la non-énergie, sans le moindre recul ni la moindre once d'humour. Il ne restait que du désespoir, de la terreur face  au ""no future"" dénoncé par les punks. ""Unknown pleasures"" et son cortège de fantômes flirtait allègrement avec la mort, et celle-ci n'allait d'ailleurs pas tarder à se manifester, transformant Joy Division en groupe maudit, au culte macabre. 20 ans après, il est toujours très difficile de s'immerger dans cette musique glaciale, tant les sentiments qu'elle véhicule sont forts. C'est pourquoi, aussi, ""Unknown pleasures"" fait partie des ces rares disques incontournables, car la musique sort de son cadre, elle devient quelque chose de quasi-surnaturel, elle s'adresse directement à quelque chose que chacun porte en soi, au plus profond de son être : l'âme."
4,"Mêlant les ambiances (qu'ils assimilent, le copier-coller n'étant pas,c'est heureux, l'habitude du duo Perry- Gerrard), c'est un album abrupt. Il reste des vestiges de SPLEEN AND IDEAL dans ""Tell me about the forest"" mais pour le morceau ""The carnival is over"", aux paroles, à la musique et à l'interprétation bouleversantes, l'album atteint des sommets. ""Yulunga"", ""Saldek"", ""Ariadne"" montrent le duo faire de l'œil aux musiques mondiales et sortir de la folk-new wave qu'ils avaient poussée à son zénith dans SPLEEN AND IDEAL. ""How fortunate the man with none"" est une balade dans laquelle Brendan Perry démontre son goût et sa maîtrise des chansons folk lyriques. Lisa Gerrard est fidèle à elle-même."
1,"Je crois que je suis l'un des rares fan des Who à ne pas vévéré cet album ! En effet je trouve déjà le concept de ce disque boiteux. En plus c'est sous à disant le premier opéra- rock (mon oeil c'est pas lui ! ) . Il y a bien sur quelques bon morceaux comme ""Go To The Mirror"" et ""1921"", sinon certains morceaux sont baclés comme ""Pinball Wizzard"" ou ""It's A Boy"" voir carrèment nul comme ""Undertune"" ou ""Tommy's Holiday Camp"" !  A éviter !"
1,"Un album de Genesis à nouveau dans la lignée des ""Abacab"",...un ramassis nauséeux de musique en manque d'inspiration avec la voix de chochotte énervante de Collins.  Quand on pense que ce même groupe a sorti des albums tels que ""A trick of the tail"", on en vient à appeler sa ""mama"" et à se demander si ce ne sont pas des ""aliens"" qui ont pris leur place. A  oublier au plus vite."
2,"J'ai toujours bien aimé Whitesnake,la voix de Coverdale,les compositions oscillant entre heavy blues et Hard rock;quelques morceaux rappelant meme le grand Led Zep.C'est pour cela que je me suis interessé à leur dernière galette.Autant le dire tout de suite,le meilleur du produit est la pochette,pour le reste que du dispensable et du formaté.Malgré la présence du duo de guitaristes à fort potentiel Reb Beach et Doug Aldrich.Cet album ne décolle jamais.Alors pour ceux qui veulent aborder le Serpent Blanc par le bon bout, qu'ils aillent du coté de Slide it in,1987, ou du mésestimé Slip of the Tongue avec Steve Vai à la gratte et des soli qui continuent à vous faire décoller 20 ans après.Ici,en guise de décollage,on assiste plutot à un crash,le grand David a perdu sa voie (sa voix?)les guitar-heroes sont vraiment fatigués,quant aux paroles qui parlent presque  toujours de la meme chose (ah les femmes)elles sont là, à la limite de la mièvrerie.Non vraiment si vous aimez ce groupe ou que vous voulez le découvrir passez votre chemin et tournez vous vers les albums cités supra  car ici,vous n'aurez à faire qu'a une vieille couleuvre déssechée par les années."
5,"En achetant le cd, je me suis quand même demandé à quoi pouvait servir un unplugged de Neil Young, une immense partie de son (immense) oeuvre étant déja acoustique. Les titres au verso du cd ne m'ont pas beaucoup aidé, je m'attendais à, disons, 'Sedan delivery' en acoustique, ou aux quelques tornades qui émaillaient le deuxième face de Rust never Sleeps ou Ragged Glory. Rien de tout cela. Je n'ai pas pu me retenir de mettre en premier 'Like a Hurricane' un peu déçu à l'avance qu'il ait décidé de débrancher cet ouragan de force et d'amour. Et là le choc ! Neil Young, avec un orgue à vapeur ou un harmonium je n'arrive pas à reconnaître, offre de ce long délire, la version la plus lyrique et la plus forte qu'il soit possible d'entendre. Débranchée, certes, masi encore plus forte. Cette curieuse voix, haut perchée et pourtant si adulte et si virile qu'elle vrille l'émotion dans le coeur. Et les autres morceaux m'ont tout autant collé au mur: Mr Soul, World on a string, Stringman qui étaient des blues sombres deviennent des monuments méconnaissables. Et Transformer Man que j'ai pris pour un inédit, jusqu'à ce que le repère sur le terrible album Trans (sans doute le plus hermétique des albums de Neil Young) mais j'ai beau l'avoir réecouté, j'ai toujours du mal à croire qu'il s'agit de la même chanson... D'autres plus classiques aportent un peu moins comparées à des versions live déja connues comme 'Pocahontas', ou le grinçant 'Needle and Damage done'. D'ailleurs on reste sur sa faim, un peu plus de chansons n'auraient pas été superflues.  La gloire et la crédibilité de Neil Young sont déjà immenses et s'étalent sur plusieurs générations, ce unplugged grandiose n'y ajoute pas grand chose, mais il est indispensable."
5,Cet album qui est l'un de mes préférés n'avait pas enore de vote. Voila qui est réparé.
1,"J'aime bien Francis Cabrel en studio, car sa voix et son accent son moins... lourd. En live c'est une catastrophe, on entend que les oies qui vont devenir foie gras dans les chansons qui sont si belles en versions originales... En tant qu'amateur, je déconseille."
2,"Enregistré en concert et traité comme un album de studio..... où sont passés les supers solos de guitare offerts lors des concerts... A part le titre ""petite annonce"" le résultat est vraiment pas terrible. Dommage pour l'avoir vu en concert le jour de France Espagne à Paris il y avait de quoi faire un vrai live."
5,"L'un des meilleurs albums des Cramps , bizarrement pas encore chroniqué ( alors je m'y colle ne serait - ce que pour rendre hommage à Lux Interior ) . Les Cramps sont un groupe à part , bien allumé , trop fort pour notre époque , pillé mille fois par d'autres qu'Ivy et Lux ne voudraient même pas comme roadies ...  Dans cet album , les dingos n'ont rien perdu de leur verve folle , de leur radicalité sonore et de leurs thèmes , heu , un peu fétichistes ( rien que la pochette déjà ) . Mais les Cramps ce n'est pas que l'image , c'est aussi et surtout la musique , l'idée qu'ils se font du rock and roll et du blues ( ""stange love"" ) du twist ( ""ultra twist"" : oubliez dick rivers ! ) et du ""surf"" ( ""sado county auto show"" ) : c'est - à - dire âpre ( ""sinners"" ) , méchant ( ""mean machine"" ) , syncopé ( ""how come you do me"" qui rappelle un peu le magnifique ""I can't hardly stand it"" sur Off The Bone ) carrément tout fou ( ""swing the big eyed rabbit"" , ""blues blues blues"" ) ou référentiel ( la reprise de ""route 66"" ) ... Pas de belles ballades bluesy à pleurer comme ""It's just that song"" sur A Date With Elvis , ou ""lonesome town"" sur Off The Bone , mais que du rock and roll et du blues dont ils restituent la pureté d'origine grâce à leurs reprises ""cryptiques"" mais aussi leurs compos originales : bref , ils ont tout compris de cette musique primaire et si essentielle ."
1,"Surestimé, chanté pitoyablement par ce pauvre Eno, non musicien, rappelons-le, beaucoup de bruit et de confusion. Surnage juste parfois la guitare miraculeuse de Philou Manzanera."
5,"Lynyrd Skynyrd a toujours été pour moi La référence du ""rock sudiste"" : de la grosse artillerie, un mur de grattes qui vous balance un boogie percutant mais qui sait aussi donner dans la ballade de haut vol . Ici, point de riffs déferlants, mais de la gratte sèche, un son clair qui donne un reflet supplémentaire à un groupe que certains cataloguent uniquement parmi les formations rednecks faites pour bouseux ! A découvrir les versions dépouillées de Sweet home Alabama, Devil in the bottle, hillbilly blues; Super !!!"
1,"Cet album, c'est la décéption. Un son ultra formaté, aucune recherche en matière de composition, c'est fade, un chant sans conviction, des arrangements bidon, bref on se fait ch... quoi."
5,"Album le plus mal aimé du groupe, le plus incompris aussi, il dévoile pourtant une magie (noire) et une maitrise incroyable pour ce groupe qu'on pensait à jamais perdu dans le rock bubble gum pour teen ager ou du hard disco. Le groupe semble pourtant en pleine capacité de ses moyens et n'a jamais été aussi créatif, (""under the rose"") en employant même en leur sein un grand autre new yorkais : Lou Reed! La production de Bob Ezrin est loin de celle de ""destroyer"", plus enrobée, plus sombre, on déplorera bien sur l'histoire sur les coupures qu'il a faite des solos d'Ace Frehley qui sont pourtant ici, MAGISTRAUX !!! (""dark light"" .. sans commentaires) Cet album préfigure déjà le grand retour de ""creatures of the night"" musicalement, faite de joyau moyen ageux (""just a boy""), de plaintes simmonesques (""mr Blackwell"") tout en gardant un tout petit pied encore dans leur son seventies mais , dans la discographie du groupe, il reste une oeuvre à part, une oeuvre ambitieuse et sérieuse ou il nous dévoile 4 grands musiciens talentueux. Et dernier acte pour Ace qui s'en sort encore une fois, haut la main."
5,Si ce n'est la meilleure en effet le team Stones Throw a en effet encore une fois le chic pour nous en mettre pleins les oreilles pour les amateurs de soul/funk pas de problèmes ils seront servis que du lourds pour ceux qui veulent découvrir sachez que ce label est un des rares a nous faire des réeditions de morceaux de cette facture alors n'hésitez pas trop cette compil' c'est du délire.
5,"de la peche, des mélodies implacables, un touché du saxophone hors du commun, tout ca c'est maceo. dial maceo est son dernier album en date, à mon avis le meilleur, alors en attendant le prochain prenez celui là."
2,"Les Adderley Brothers formaient un socle fondamental dans l'histoire du jazz. On ne peut pas dire que cette 'renaissance' (phenix) soit d'un grand intérêt musical. La période est peu propice à ""l'histoire"" du jazz. C'est l'époque de l'incursion de l'électrique et les 'claviers' de George Duke proposent plus une panoplie de sons plus ou moins datés (maintenant) qu'une exploration musicale des nouvelles possibilités offertes à l'époque. Bref à oublier (malheureusement) mais il y a des dizaines de CDs des Adderley Brothers qui méritent une écoute attentive. On peut donc faire l'impasse sur le dernier 'opus' officiel des Soul brothers."
2,"Groundation nous a habituer à du bon, du très bon même. Ce disque reste un anecdote, surement pas avoir pour un premier achat du groupe. Par contre, TOUT le reste de la discographie est terrible. Si vous voulez acheter un premier disque de Groundation, rabattez vous sur ""Hebron gate"" ou ""we free again""."
4,"Tout le monde le sait bien, maclo aime faire des choses différentes. Flamenco jazz, jazz indien, jazz fusion, bref toutes les formes imaginables de l'ethno jazz dans son sens le plus large.  Cet album est encore différent (si si!) et si il n'est pas le meilleurs qu'il ait fait, on en découvre pas moins des facettes inattendues de l'artiste. Petit coup de coeur pour la musique ""ELECTRIC DREAMS"" qui est un veritable bijou!"
5,"cet album est une pure merveille symphonique mais tres different du premier album (les parties black metal de ""enter"" ont ete remplacé par de formidables choeurs d'hommes). La melancolie est tres presente dans ce cd et l'emotion devient encore plus fort avec la superbe voix de shanon den adel. A conseiller a ceux qui aime tristania et the sins of thy beloved. sinon pour les autres...achetez le aussi rien que pour les frissons d'emois qu'il procure.Pour moi...j'ai craqué!"
2,"Presque 4 années se sont écoulées depuis sa dernière livraison studio, Born In The USA en 1984, lorsque Springsteen publie fin 87, Tunnel Of Love. Cet album marque un double tournant dans la carrière du Boss : il est enregistré sans le légendaire E Street Band et les textes sont moins portés sur les questions de société habituellement chères au Boss que sur ses états d'âme et ses problèmes de coeur du moment. Tunnel Of Love porte bien son titre puisqu'il est constitué d'une succession de chansons parlant... de mal d'amour, d'amour impossible, d'amour compliqué, d'amour incompris, d'amour perdu, bref, on l'aura compris... d'Amour ! Musicalement, l'album est peu convaincant : a quelques rares exceptions (l'excellent Spare Parts, la simpliste mais imparable Tougher Than The Rest, Brillant Disguise et peut-être All That Heaven Will Allow), les mélodies sont pauvres voire incipides et les textes parfois proche de la niaiserie, en tout cas souvent indigne de Springsteen. La production retenue n'arrange rien puisqu'elle est une fois de plus très marquée 80's : comme sur Born In The USA, on est proche de la crise de foie à l'écoute de ces couches superposées de synthé et de ce son de batterie ultra artificiel... Le ponpon revient à l'intro de Tunnel Of Love (le titre) que l'on jurerait composée par je ne sais quel groupe New Wave... Bref, cet album est une réelle déception, peut-être la seule de toute la carrière du Boss et sur 35 ans de carrière c'est finalement assez peu..."
5,"""Oxygène"" était le disque de l'air, ""Equinoxe"" est celui de l'eau... Le premier était lumineux, celui-ci plutôt clair obscur...  Des courants le traversent, comme une rivière qui coule, pour finir par se jeter dans la mer, au loin...  La nuit s'éloigne mais c'est une journée tourmentée qui s'annonce ... le ciel est comme le métal, recouvert par endroits de gros nuages sombres; des gouttes de pluie sur la vitre... un rivage désert, une grande falaise noire, et le ressac incessant des vagues... des arbres dans la tempête... quelques éclaircies percent entre les averses, et puis c'est l'arrivée du crépuscule majestueux, avant que la nuit ne recouvre à nouveau toutes choses, alors que l'on est bien au chaud et qu'on imagine les éléments qui se déchaînent au-dehors......  Jean-Michel Jarre réussit à me faire rêver, planer, me transporte grâce à son génie des synthétiseurs (nombreux et variés), mélange de sons évoquant les éléments naturels (vent, pluie, courant...) et de sonorités plus abstraites, aux airs mémorables et sublimes (comme un Brahms électronique), dans un flux qui m'emporte avec délice... Une densité et une force descriptive musicale étonnantes.  On n'a qu'à mettre le casque sur les oreilles et fermer les yeux: on est transporté sur la planète Equinoxe!  Une oeuvre remarquablement fluide, admirablement équilibrée, construite et interprétée, romantique sans être mélancolique, rythmique aussi, et prenante du début à la fin.  Un pur chef-d'oeuvre de la musique électronique, que le temps qui passe n'a en rien altéré, comme les marées des océans éternels...  Tout simplement l'un de mes trois ou quatre albums préférés, tous genres confondus."
4,"Alors que depeche Mode n'était vaguement connu que pour son tube ""just can' t get enough"" issu du premier album construit par Vince Clarke , le groupe signe ici un opus qui le propulse dans les classements francais avec notamment ""people are people"" . L'amorce de l'experimentation musicale menée avec ""construction time again"",le précédent album prend ici toute son ampleur avec des titres tels que ""blasphemous rumours"" ou ""something to do"" . Sampling, rythmes efficaces et mélodies imparables marquent le véritable tournant de ce groupe unique ."
2,"Quand j'ai découvert ""poison"", le précédent opus de jay-jay, j'ai été fasciné par cette voix sublime, ces rythmiques trip-hop lancinantes et ces arrangements (cordes, piano) très réussis. Un chef-d'oeuvre, sans aucun doute. A l'écoute de ""on the radio"", le nouveau single, j'ai été d'abord surpris puis réjouis que ce brave jay sorte de sa déprime contagieuse pour nous livrer une musique plus électro et plus dansante. Mais quelle déception quand, tout enthousiaste (au début...) , j'ai écouté l'album! Passée la bonne surprise du single, les autres morceaux abusent de synthés 80's et de rythmiques très froides, qui à mon avis ne collent pas du tout avec sa voix exceptionnelle. Le tout vire rapidement dans un trip électro-kitsch plutôt indigeste. Dommage. Bref, heureusement qu'il chante! Mais je ne perds pas l'espoir d'avoir un jour sur ma platine le digne successeur de cette perle rare qu'est ""poison""."
1,"Cet album constitue la charnière dans la carrière du groupe, après la mort de Cliff Burton et l'arrivée de Jason Newsted ! Après 3 albums de grande classe, Metallica nous endort avec un album inaudible. Aucune finesse, du bruit de bout en bout (à l'exception peut-être de « Blackened » et « One »), une baterie omniprésente. Début des années de vache maigre (au niveau musical s'entend !). Amis métalleux, passez votre chemin !"
4,"The warning est le premier véritable album du groupe, paru en 1984. Le premier  , sorti un an plus tôt avait déjà montré les qualités de ce groupe. ""The warning"" est dans la continuité mais enfonce le clou. D'entrée, on est impressionné par le professionnalisme que dégage Queensrÿche. Des musiciens excellents, un chanteur impressionnant (pour le moins !) quand il faut tutoyer les notes les plus hautes et un soliste qui fait des étincelles. Avec leurs têtes de gamins, Geoff Tate et Chris de Garmo apparaissent d'ailleurs comme étant l'ossature du groupe avec le second guitariste, Michael Wilton. Ces trois-là signant toutes les compos de l'album. Les titres, même s'ils manquent encore un peu d'originalité (Iron Maiden n'est pas loin - cf ""Child of fire"") montrent un talent indéniable de composition. Les ""Warning"", ""En Force"" ou encore ""Deliverance"" sont de belles pièces de Heavy mélodique. La ballade mélancolique n'est pas oubliée (""No sanctuary""). Le superbe ""Take hold of the flame"" ainsi que ""Roads to madness"" annoncent le chemin plus progressif que le groupe prendra par la suite.  On sent chez ce groupe une marge de progression énorme, une envie d'innover (""NM 156"") qui se confirmera deux ans plus tard sur l'album suivant, le magnifique ""Rage for order"". Ceux qui connaissent Queensrÿche grâce à leurs derniers albums et ne connaîtraient pas celui-ci pourront tout de même être un peu surpris car c'est bien plus ""direct"" que ce qu'ils ont fait par la suite.  Il s'agit cependant pour moi d'un album essentiel dans la discographie du groupe, en tout cas bien plus que les dernières productions."
1,"Alors Priest nous avait habitué à du bon heavy metal traditionnel pendant la décennie 80, et là ils nous livrent un album frisant le trash metal! C'est Priest ça? On a l'impression que c'est un autre groupe qui joue et Halford chante d'une manière totalement dangereuse pour les tympans. Si vous êtes fan du bon vieux heavy, ne prêtez même pas l'oreille à cet album qui pourrait vous dégoutez de Priest. A tous ceux qui ont découvert Priest par cet album, allez voir plutôt du côté de la période 1978-1982!"
2,"La compil est Bien, si vous ne tombez pas sur la version Remasterisé. Le son de batterie ressemble à une boite à rythmes, des sons de guitares et autres effets ont été rajouté. Quand t on connait l'original, la version remasterisé passe tres mal."
2,"La pochette est éloquente et représentative de l'album : Angus tente (vainement) de rétablir le courant ! Peu ou pas d'étincelle, des compos linéaires et sans véritable génie... Bref un album en demi teinte pour nos kangourous électriques. On lui préférera sans hésitation let There be rock, Highway to hell ou encore back in black... Comme le groupe le dit lui-même sur un des titres, Angus et sa bande est ""deep in the hole"""
2,"je ne comprend pas pourquoi sa maison de disque à p'eu laisser sortir un live pareil,si zazie était enrouée ce soir la, il ne fallait pas l'enregistrée car au final ca donne un album assez médiocre qui est limite irritant pour les oreilles, et qui me fais regretter mon achat, j'y verrai à deux fois lors d'un prochain album live de zazie."
1,"Cela me fait de la peine de le dire, mais le génie de Kate Bush est cruellement absent de cet album. Les mélodies sont plates et sa voix est noyée dans des arrangements conventionnels. On ressent un manque d'énergie du début à la fin. C'est bien dommage."
2,"Avec une belle pochette, Shaman sort en 2002 et, dans la continuation de supernatural, nous présente une musique dansante propre à animer les boites latinos. En effet, si la production est rutilante, le contenu nous laisse sceptique. Où sont les inspirations d'Abraxas ou Amigos ? Certes, les interventions guitaristiques sont resplendissantes, Carlos n'a pas perdu son toucher subtile et aligne des solos étincelants, ce qui sauve quelque peu l'ensemble de cet opus. Beaucoup d'invités pour cet album dont Placido Domingo qui s'amuse à chanter dans ""novus"" bof...aucun intérêt. Bon je retourne vite écouter les premiers albums de notre artiste et l'incontournable ""Lotus"" où Santana se transcende en live !"
2,"Sur la quarantaine de disques que ce grand artiste  a sorti, celui-ci est de loin un de ses plus mauvais. Rien a voir avec les perles de ses debuts (Abraxas, Caravanserai, Moonflower, Marathon,...) ni avec les tres bons disques de annees 90. Si vous voulez avoir un aperçu de son talent, c'est un disque a eviter..."
1,"SANTANA REVIENT AVEC CET ALBUM ET ON AURAIT BIEN AIME SOIT QU'IL RESTE OU IL ETAIT SOIT QU'IL NOUS SORTE UN ALBUM DE QUALITE. CET ALBUM EST NON SEULEMENT NUL MAIS EN PLUS IL CIBLE SUR TOUT CE QUI EST A LA MODE EN CE MOMENT. ON NOUS FAIT CROIRE QUE C'EST DE LA WORLD MUSIQUE, LAISSEZ-MOI RIRE. SI VOUS AIMEZ SANTANA RESSORTEZ VOTRE ALBUM ABRAXAS ET JOUISSEZ DE PUR MOMENT DE VERITABLE MUSIQUE ET JETER CET ALBUM MEDIATHICO-COMMERCIAL."
1,"Impression d'entendre une radio généraliste, inodore et incolore. Santana est-il derrière son robot?"
5,"Ah, Radiohead..."
2,"Au moment de donner un successeur à l'illustre  , Radiohead est attendu au tournant et a une grosse pression sur les épaules. Se pose alors l'habituel dilemme : ""jouer la sécurité"" en poursuivant dans la même voie ou bien surprendre en proposant tout autre chose, quitte à froisser et perdre quelques fans en route ? Ce fût la seconde option qui fût choisie. Et bingo, le public et les critiques, dans leur grande majorité, adhérèrent et les suivirent dans ce changement de cap moins original et courageux qu'il en a l'air. En effet, le coup du groupe de rock qui vire électro n'a rien de nouveau, c'est même un grand classique. New Order, Primal Scream et U2, dans une veine plus dancefloor (l'électronica initiée par le label WARP n'existant pas encore à l'époque), s'y sont risqués avant eux, avec plus ou moins de succès. Certes, la structure couplets/refrain est ici abandonnée, et les guitares bâillonnées. Mais bon, ils n'ont rien inventé pour autant (ils n'en ont d'ailleurs pas la prétention. La musique, au fond, n'est rien d'autre que brassages, ""revivals"" et influences plus ou moins bien digérées). On a donc là un disque disparate et sur-référencé de ""post-prog-rock expérimental"" avec un gros trait d'électronica millésimée WARP (Autechre, Aphex Twin) et une pincée de Mingus. Il contient quelques réussites comme ""The National Anthem"" avec sa basse chamanique et son final free-jazz, ou le bien nommé ""In Limbo"", suite d'accords répétitifs dans une atmosphère psyché bien ""druggy"". Mais aussi des titres anecdotiques tels l'interlude ""Treefingers"" ou ""Motion picture soundtrack"". Quand à l'imagerie du groupe engagé, altermondialiste, écolo et anti-Bush (quelle audace ! Qui soutient encore l'ex-Président U.S si ce n'est le beauf Bruce Willis et quelques illuminatis ? :)), elle est sans doute sincère mais trop ""marketée"" pour être honnête, et n'empêche pas le groupe de demander de sacrés émoluments pour une prestation au festival d'Arras. Par la suite, le quintette d'Oxford sortira trois autres albums ( ,   et  ) de la même trempe, en renouant toutefois progressivement avec le format pop et les guitares. Pour conclure, on dira que Radiohead plaira aux ""branchés"" (contrairement à U2 ou Coldplay, le groupe de Thom Yorke n'est pas ""grand public"". Ouf, pas de nomination aux ""NRJ bidule awards"" en vue : trop dépressif et torturé, pas assez ""glamour"" :)) ainsi qu'aux ados un peu curieux n'ayant pas les oreilles encore complètement formatées par la FM (Radiohead, on aime ou pas mais ça reste de la musique, contrairement aux cochonneries Star-Académiques ou dance/R'n'B). Ils penseront y entendre une musique innovante et merveilleuse. Par contre, les allergiques à l'électronique et/ou ceux ayant une culture musicale plus développée resteront de marbre à l'écoute de ces complaintes déstructurées quasi-autistes."
2,"Voici donc l' album du doute, de la remise en question et du renouveau en forme de laboratoire musical. Le ""Rock Bottom"" des années 2000, la rencontre entre Autechre, Aphex Twin, Alice Coltrane, Charles Mingus, Brian Eno, Scott Walker et Soft Machine sur un même opus...Vous en rêviez les médias l' ont écrit pour le penser à votre place. Le résultat est fade, sans âme, un album où l' aridité règne en maître; en bref Kid A est une tomperie sans nom. Si cet album était sorti en 1979, il aurait fait pâle figure face aux Pop Group, Talking Heads, Wire, Gang of Four ou Joy Division; il aurait  été traîté de la même façon que Genesis ou Rick Wakeman. Pour resentir de vraies émotions écoutez plutôt ""Tilt"", ""Mark Hollis"", ""Dogs Of Sevotion"", ""Feuded"", ""Museum Of Dannys"" ou...""OK Computer""."
4,"C’est après « 1 :00 am » et « (In) visible », deux chefs d’œuvres absolus en matière de rock sombre et mystérieux, que Nihil décide de se fendre d’une sorte d’intermède dans sa carrière. « Pandora’s box » n’étant pas à proprement parlé un nouvel album du groupe. Trop long pour être un EP, ce disque en a pourtant quelque part des allures. Explications. Sur les neuf titres constituant l’album, seulement quatre s’avèrent être de nouvelles compos (« Disfigured », « The pandora’s box », « A dusky waltz » et « Coma »), le reste étant, hormis les interludes (« Do not open » et « San francisco 1978 »), des relectures en version plus « posée » de morceaux du répertoire du groupe. C’est ainsi que « Deus pendulum » tiré de « 1 :00 am » se transforme en « The time machine », et que « Fragile » et « Lies within » extraits de « (In) visible » deviennent « Frailty (thy name is woman) » et « Mensonges ». Et comme Nihil est un grand groupe, le résultat se montre plus que probant. Articulé autour d’un piano et d’une guitare claire, les nouvelles compositions tiennent le haut du pavé. Dans une veine pop que l’on ne saurait trop décrire par peur d’en dénaturer l’essence, le groupe évolue comme un poisson dans l’eau. Des titres calmes, d’une douceur abyssale, quasi atmosphériques, portés par la toujours somptueuses voix d’Yves, voilà ce que renferme l’objet. Le piano a remplacé les guitares saturées et l’exercice s’il aurait pu se révéler désastreux prend ici des allures de tour de force tant une chanson comme « Deus pendulum », sans doute à la base l’une des plus lourde du combo, aurait pu se retrouver massacrée en version soft. Il n’en est rien, « The time machine » est une perle. Rappelant parfois Antimatter de par son ambiance éthérée, ce « Pandora’s box » est un album de grande classe et même s’il est décevant de constater la pauvreté de son packaging, son contenu n’en reste pas moins somptueux de bout en bout. Une preuve supplémentaire de l’immense talent de ces Bordelais."
5,"carrement dans l'exacte meme ligné que kid A et vraiment aussi bon, c plus que du rock psychedelic je trouve ca  meme tripant un peu a la sigur ros, exellant !!!"
1,"Mais là Radiohead devient vraiment exaspérant, déjà parce qu'on nous l'impose pour des raisons très obscures comme ""le meilleur groupe du monde"", parce que leurs poses d'artistes torturés et géniaux sont fausses et calculées, leur musique facile, superficielle et peu courageuse, empruntant grossièrement aux artistes vraiment novateurs . Radiohead est cependant un groupe très doué pour avoir l'air talentueux et pour savoir ce qui sonnera moderne aux oreilles des adolescents et des critiques opportunistes .  ""Amnesiac"" est probablement le disque préféré de Mylene Farmer ."
1,"je dois dire qu'apres m'etre délecté d'opus remarquables tels pablo honey, the bends ou encore ok computer,j'ai tout d'abord pensé à une plaisanterie lorsque j'ai entendu pour la premiere fois Amnesiac ainsi que Kid A qui demontrent que, bien que Radiohead debordait de talents avant ces deux derniers albums (d'une mediocrité absolue tant les chansons sont plates et limités au stricte minimum au niveau de la recherche musicale)ce groupe semble bel et bien essouflé et recherche tant bien que mal à conserver son image honorifique. ce qui m'agace par dessus tout ce sont les critiques qui soit sont de mêche ou bien denuées de goût,pour glorifier ainsi de tels flop.car franchement Kid A et Amnesiac ne cassent pas des briques et j'aurai préféré que Radiohead prenne sa retraite apres le geniallissime OK Computer plutot que de tenter de se raccrocher aux branches et de rester sur une pointe d'amertume."
2,"Après la baffe de Kid A, qui a assomé les foules par sa médiocrité et ses relents nauséabonds d'éléctro dépassée - en clair, une album de bidouillage et de collages de choses déjà vues -, ils nous remette,t ça avec Amnesiac. Album bizarroïde, complètement incohérent, avec des sons à la limite du supportable ( ""pulk-pull revolving doors"" ). Mélange improbable entre des origines lointaines rock et de l'electronique pas très au point. Effectivement, Radiohead avance, radiohead change, radiohead se prend très au sérieux, et ça marche. Expert dans l'art du paraitre et de la manière, le groupe n'a pas de mal à se faire passer pour génial même après 2 albums aussi déplorables. De toutes manières leur album le mieux reste OK Computer, tout le monde est d'accord là dessus. Même The Bends et pablo Honey étant bons sans être géniaux, et avait déjà un côté inégal. Enfin, dans cet ""Amnesiac"", il reste quelques bonnes idées, ""I might be wrong"" est une chanson sympathique, ""Knives Out"" est pas mal aussi ... Le reste est à la limite de l'audible, certains titres comme ""You and whose army"", ou ""Pyramid song"", ressemble à des chansons d'amateurs mal étudiées et mal finalisées, enregistrées avec un dictaphone ... Alors qu ça soit fait exprès on pas, on s'en fiche, quand on achète un CD, on aime bien entendre de la musique ... La palme revient à Pulk-Pull revolving doors qui est tout simplement inaudibles. UNe honte d'oser mettre ça sur un CD !!! Reste Radiohead sur scène, un groupe qui assure et qui sait faire vibrer le public ... Mais enfin entre ce qu'on peut supporter en live et ce qu'on peut supporter chez soit, pour + de 20 euros, il y a une marge !!!!!!!"
2,"Pour l'avoir déjà écouté, j'ai trouvé un timbre de voix qui n'est pas sans rappeler un certain Cobain mélancolique. Le style de l'album n'est pas harmonieux, Radiohead passe de morceaux plutôt calmes à la limite de l'endormissement à d'autres plus saccadés qui donnent un faux rythme à cet album. On aurait pu croire qu'il aurait été mieux réussi que le précédent mais le fait est: on ne peut pas réussir 2 albums en aussi peu de temps (8 mois d'intervalle entre Kid A et ce dernier opus!) à la limite il vaut mieux mettre 5 ans pour sortir un album que l'on pourrait qualifier de chef d'oeuvre (tels ceux des RHCP )plutôt que 8 mois pour faire un coup commercial bien que l'éthique du groupe s'en défende! Avis aux amateurs mais pour moi The Bends fut le plus réussi!"
1,"Y a pas à dire. Radiohead ça restera toujours aussi niais, tarte, fade, avec des textes ""soi-disant"" engagés, alors qu'on sait depuis des décennies que pleurer sur le méchant système est le meilleur moyen de le combler... heu, surtout en vendant son disque sans prix fixe... ce qui ne constitue qu'une publicité indirecte puisqu'à présent le prix s'est aligné. Mais quelle audace! Surtout qu'il y a depuis longtemps sur le net des tas d'artistes qui vendent leurs albums sans prix établi (mais avec un prix recommandé), et de façon permanente...bref. Genre je crache sur le système mais il me le rend tellement bien. Oui, moi aussi je trouve que pour un révolutionnaire Che Guevara fait gagner beaucoup d'argent aux vendeurs de t-shirts capitalistes. Cherchez le rapport..."
4,ce disque est magnifique. son son est exceptionnel et fera sonner merveilleusement votre chaîne hifi. Il rivalise selon moi avec ok computer
1,"Jamais groupe n'a été autant surestimé et disque autant réévalué. Le Velvet Underground n'était rien d'autre qu'un groupe de musicos branchés pensant qu'il était facile de faire passer nos vessies pour des lanternes en proposant des sons de violons électriques inaudibles pendant plus de 10 minutes et en nous faisant croire que c'est génial...pire, on parle même d'oeuvre d'art dans certains milieux et en lisant les interviews de John Cale on se rend compte qu'encore à l'heure actuelle, ces types se prennent pour des créateurs d'avant-garde... Honnêtement, est-ce qu'il y a vraiment des gens qui aiment écouter ce disque et qui trouvent ce machin (à cocher au choix) subversif, urbain, bouleversant, maléfique etc... Bien sûr les goûts et les couleurs...Evidemment je mets 0 étoiles, mais il faut mettre au moins 1 étoile alors tant pis ! Le Velvet, c'est pas bon (surtout ce disque quand même) mais le pire, c'est que l'aura et la réputation du groupe est telle que l'on veut nous faire croire qu'il s'agit là de musique contemporaine américaine."
4,"Ce cd est le temoignage audio de ce que fut l'épopée du plus grand groupe de rock'n'roll de Detroit ( du monde ? ). Le groupe de jeunesse d'Iggy Pop parcouru les salles de concert des USA, reussissant ses grandeurs mais aussi ses decadences. Si la reputation du groupe reste sulfureuse, c'est bien à cause d'evenements tels que ceux gravés sur ce cd. Le chanteur provoque des bikers, insulte le public, joue un vieux tube garage puis finit au sol, touché par des bouteilles de bieres s'ecrasant sur la scene. Ce sera le dernier concert du groupe, en proie à des problemes relationnels ainsi qu'à la terrible addiction heroinomane pour certains des membres ( Iggy, leader fou, James Williamson, guitare malaxe-metal , Ron Asheton, Rock Action derrière sa batterie, Scott Asheton, le bassiste straight et dechu de son premier poste de lead guitar ).  Les Stooges, c'était ce cd, un mélange de beauté intemporelle et de fureur digne de désaxés, à mi-chemin entre les plus grands groupes garage et les futurs punk."
5,"Dans la foulée de son célèbre hit ""A Whiter Shade of Pale"", Procol Harum sort son premier album en 1967. Le groupe interpelle par un mélange de blues, de rock symphonique et psychédélique, des morceaux très sixties avec des chansons style années 30. Une vraie réussite. Des tubes : le morceau-titre et son orgue légendaire ; le rock ""Conquistador"", ""Homburg"" et surtout ""Repent Walpurgis"" et son Prélude de Bach. Une perle."
1,"Ce type de best est l'archétype du ""best of"" inutile puisque ""Frankie Goes To Hollywood"" n'a sortie que deux albums ""Welcome To The Pleasure Dome"" (1984) et ""Liverpool"" (1986). Dans ce cas, il faut mieux acheter le superbe ""Welcome To The Pleasure Dome"" qui se présente comme un ""délirant"" opéra (rock) new wave et le beaucoup moins réussi ""Liverpool"". Jetez vous le ""Welcome To The Pleasure Dome"" et vous comprendrez ce que la new wave (fourre tout musical éclectique) peut avoir de délirant et profondément génial."
2,"Tricky a l'avantage de savoir se remettre en question et évoluer. Cela ne mène pas toujours au meilleur. La preuve par cet album. Malgré quelques bons morceaux, je suis resté sur ma faim. Ils sont bien loin les sommets qu'étaient  , puis   et son autre réalisation sous le nom de  . Pourtant, rien n'est désespéré, son constant renouvellement entretien l'espoir d'un possible renouveau appréciable."
1,"Parmi ces horreurs produites dans les années 80. Hymnes populaires pleins de bonté. Bonne conscience à revendre. Nausée. Epoque dorée du charity business. Aaah les ventes de disques c'était autre chose à l'époque(dixit les maisons de disques). Pour la petite histoire, chanteur ""tête d'oeuf"" écolo à l'époque de son groupe, qui aujourd'hui (2009)a viré à 180°. Le Monsieur devenu Ministre de l'environnement vient d'autoriser l'ouverture à ciel ouvert d'une mine d'uranium géante.1 400 tonnes d'oxyde d'uranium devraient être extraites chaque année à Four Mile, dans le sud du pays. Ce sera l'une des dix plus importantes mines d'uranium de la planète. Grâce à elle, l'Australie entend tripler ses exportations d'uranium. Décision provoquant un tollé chez les défenseurs de l'environnement: ""Les déchets chimiques et radioactifs vont pénétrer la nappe phréatique"" d'après l'Australian Conservation Foundation. Le même Monsieur qui dénonçait dans ses chansons les pollueurs, le nucléaire et les puissantes compagnies minières. Opportuniste ? Mais non  pensez donc .... juste de l'économie réaliste."
5,"Et quel live s'il vous plait ! Hormis peut-etre 2 ou 3 chansons qui sont absentes (comme Whatever, The Masterplan et Up In The Sky) ce disque est un pur bonheur enfin arrivé. Deux reprises dont un excellent Hey Hey, My My et un Supersonic qui atteint sa vitesse de croisiere, tout est bon la-dedans...non ?"
5,"Manquait à Oasis, en-dehors de quelques B-sides live de ci de là, un véritable enregistrement public. Voilà qui est fait, magistralement. L'ambiance est là, on pourrait bien sûr regretter l'absence de certains titres qui firent leur succès, mais les standards du groupe font une fois de plus leur oeuvre, particulièrement sur le CD 2. Les nouveaux membres du groupe font merveille (Rythm guitar &amp; Bass) et donnent au ""mur de son"" Oasis un relief qui inscrit durablement ce Wembley dans l'histoire du rock."
2,"D'abord se rendre à l'évidence : il n'y aura pas d'autre Definitly Maybe à attendre d'Oasis. C'est un crève caeur de l'accepter tant ce digne successeur a été désiré, fantasmé... Un groupe ne produit jamais qu'un seul album de cette trempe dans sa carrière. Il fallait avoir ceci en tête avant de se lancer dans la découverte de Dig Out Your Soul. Cela évite d'emblée la grosse désillusion, celle que tous les fans du groupe ont pris en pleine face à l'écoute de Be Here Now, Standing On the Shoulder Of Giants, Heathen Chemistry et dans une moindre mesure, What's The Story et Don't Believe The Truth. Dig Out your Soul confirme le retour d'Oasis à un niveau plutôt honorable, déjà amorcé avec le précédent album. Avec des titres comme Bag It up qui ouvre l'album, le single The Shock Of the Lightning, I'm Outta Time, très belle ballade écrite par Liam ou Falling Down, les frères Gallagher confirment leurs talents d'auteur/compositeur sans toutefois le forcer. Le reste est en effet à l'avenant, souvent en mid-tempo avec des manques d'inspiration manifestes... Noel s'obstine à chanter sur quelques titres et c'est dommage car sa voix est et restera toujours fade à côté de celle de Liam. Chantées par ce dernier, High Horse Lady et Falling Down auraient pris une tout autre dimension. L'ampoulée To be Where There's Life est fatiguante. The Turning et Ain't Got Nothing auraient pu être de bonnes chansons d'Oasis mais restent fainéantes. Waiting For The Rapture et The Nature Of Reality passent complètement inaperçues. Soldier On sauve cette fin d'album bien fade. Au final, ce nouvel album d'Oasis laisse un goût d'inachevé, la sensation que le potentiel existe encore mais qu'il n'est plus que très rarement exploité. Que les deux frangins Gallagher se rendent à l'évidence : ils ont définitivement perdu le feu sacré de leurs débuts, cette envie d'en découdre avec le monde entier qui leur permettait d'affirmer, le torse bombé, qu'ils étaient le « fucking plus grand groupe du monde ! »."
2,"Même après maintes écoutes, je n'accroche absolument pas à ce nouveau disque d'un groupe qui se veut d'un come back phare, tant a été fait du tabac autour comme c'est souvent le cas avec des ""réssurections"" organisées. Manque d'inspiration et de mélodies qu'on retient. Dommage. Deux étoiles généreuses, parce que les 2 premiers morceaux sont pas mal, après.... on attend une surprise."
5,"Ecrasé par le succès planétaire (et involontaire, il faut bien l'avouer) de ""Nevermind"", Kurt Cobain, aux épaules trop frêles pour porter pareil fardeau, nous offrit avec ""In Utero"" l'album le plus viscéral qui soit. Un son brut, qui pourrait paraître brouillon aux oreilles des profanes, des guitares saturées, une rythmique moins assagie que dans leur précédent opus : tout était réuni pour rendre cet album moins ""facile"" d'accès que le précédent, moins grand public en tout cas. Et pourtant, la touche Nirvana est toujours là, intacte, même après plus de dix ans. On trouve sur ""In Utero"" cette même rage, cette même poésie que dans tous les disques de ce groupe maintenant mythique. Ecorché vif, Cobain, soutenu par ses deux fidèles complices, atteint l'état de grâce dans cet album, au prix qu'on connait désormais. Indispensable, tout simplement."
2,"Disque fait à la va vite et le problème c'est que ça s'entend ! Les compos sont très moyennes, le son est crade et le tout très sombre voir glauque. Cela frémit sur quelques morceaux mais ça ne décolle jamais. Très inférieur à Nevermind"
5,"Grâce aux tourments et à la sincérité de Kurt, à ses talents de compositeur et parolier, à l'énergie de ses deux compères et à la production brute (et pourtant sophistiquée!) de l'incorruptible  Steve Albini, nous avons affaire ici à une véritable œuvre  d'art, ce qui n'est pas fréquent sur les deux décennies 80's - 90's. Merci à ceux qui ont réalisé cette œuvre  et à ceux qui ont rendu cette réalisation possible."
5,"Un monument du mouvemnt grunge qui s'est épanoui au début des années 90. Des chansons tristes et torturées, mais d'une puissance inégalée. Cette musique a ouvert une nouvelle voie à toute une génération, on ne vit pas cela tous les jours... A compléter absolument avec leur album unplugged, qui plaira peut-être plus à ceux qui préfèrent des atmosphères plus intimes."
1,"Prenez un ptit groupe de rock banal : ni mauvais ni bon dans son genre. Pas un talent exceptionnel, mais qu'importe ... L'important est ailleurs (la vérité est ailleurs ??). Des compos à la guitare sèche sur des textes dépressifs, un joli garçon blondinet au beau regard triste (ingrédient CAPITAL)... Une espèce de boy-scout (guitare sèche), mais en négatif. Pas le joyeux drille, pas type castor junior non plus. Plutôt un castor qui ne bosse pas, pas qu'il soit fainéant non, simplement car il n'y a pas de travail dans sa région. Alors notre boy-scout sera plutôt « castor sous tranxene ». De plus fils issu d'une famille décomposée (violence familiale, alcool, viol ..... j'en passe). « Castor bouleversé » donc. Double dose de tranxene donc. Pour devenir un bon rock band il ne reste plus qu'à électrifier le tout. Ensuite peut commencer le matraquage médiatique. Suivra une vie dissolue collant parfaitement à l'image véhiculée. Excellent pour les affaires,  l'Artiste, beaucoup trop pur (avec un peu de poudre dans les narines), vit mal sa surmédiatisation (montage d'une vie amoureuse rock'n'roll « scandaleuse » à la Bonnie &amp; Clyde, pardon à la Sailor et Lula, c'était alors plus dans l'air du temps).  Ces bons ingrédients nous amèneront à en devenir le porte-étendard de toute une génération. Le consommateur, pardon le fan peut désormais pleinement s'identifier à ce qui est entrain de devenir une idole. Sentiment d'appartenance recherché par les ados dévorés de maux ........ Cerise sur le gâteau, notre magnifique beau garçon (fondamental cela), aura l'idée de se suicider et ne se rate pas (pour notre plus grand malheur et pour nos malheureuses oreilles). La machine médiatique s'empare de l'Affaire Rock'n'roll de la décennie : matraquage surabondant. Grâce à cette nouvelle il deviendra l'idole de la décennie 90. Le voilà transporté, malgré lui, aux côtés des James Dean, Jim Morrison, Syd Vicious (autre grand n'importe quoi), Che Guevara (assassin notoire devenu héros de la résistance et de la rébellion petit bourgeois)....... On entendra alors tout et n'importe quoi à son sujet (mort « symbolique » à l'âge de 27 ans, comme étant un signe. Son destin était-il écris à l'avance ? Roulement de tambours ......C'est pas beau ça ?) ........ Mais l'objectif est atteint, le voilà devenu immortel (pour notre plus grand malheur). Du jour au lendemain de sa mort ce sont des légions de nouveaux fans  qui se créées. Entré dans la légende il pourra désormais polluer des générations d'ados mal dans leur peau et amoureux des beaux gosses écorchés vif.  Le monde du rock'n'roll business en fera ses choux gras : outre les ventes de disques, articles de presse vendeurs  (couv' pour appâter le chalant et doper les ventes), biographies nombreuses de pseudos connaisseurs rock, film de « cinéma », pseudos reportages nourris de scandales trouvés au fond des poubelles .... , du marchandising aussi, posters ... (aux côtés de notre assassin préféré le bien nommé Che Guevara)...... Alors, Nirvana, avant tout une affaire/une histoire médiatique ???? Une aubaine pour beaucoup en tout cas. Petit souvenir personnel de l'époque de sa mort, environ 1 mois après son annonce : ma friterie préférée de l'époque avait accroché à ses murs aux côtés de posters de James Dean et Jim Morrison, un magnifique poster de notre ami Kurt (très photogénique il faut l'avouer). Toute une poésie au milieu de l'odeur de fritures (l'anecdote est véridique). Le marchand de frites devait trouver que cela ferait le meilleur effet, du coup il était dans l'air du temps. Une preuve de bon goût sans doute. J'avais alors pensé que le poster aurait pu également trôner chez mon coiffeur. Avec les autres photos de beaux gosses. Le voilà désormais devenu Icône. Un suicidé idole des jeunes. On a les héros qu'on mérite. Bigger than life."
1,"Vraiment, j'ai du chroniquer ce CD et ca a pas été facile, parce que j ai du l'écouter plusieurs fois... En dehors du fait que je considère que c'est de la musique pour ados et que c'est pas mon genre préféré, je déteste le coté politique de l'album: certes ils détestent Chirac et Sarko mais ils font des soirées dans les écoles de commerce... Qu'on soit pour ou contre c pas le pbm, c'est juste qu'il faut être logique...  Donc je mets une étoile, juste pour la chanson qui est une insulte à l'anglais mais qui est à mourir de rire vu l'accent (daïng eulone ...)"
2,"Bon, soyons clairs : il y a 2 bons morceaux, mais déjà sortis sur d'autres disques (bien meilleurs), la moitié du disque est la BO du dessin animé signée George Martin : de qualité, certes, mais c'est plus une musique d'ambiance qu'un tube à la Beatles. Quant aux 4 originaux, disons que Hey Bulldog n'est pas mauvais, sans atteindre des sommets, All together now est très sympa à chanter dans un stade, entre supporters, et It's all too much, son titre part de lui-même. Seule petite chose intéressante, et toujours pour les puristes, la chanson Only a northern song, de George, qui sonne volontairement faux et désaccordée aux oreilles . Ceci étant, le dessin animé vaut peut-être plus le coup d'oeil, si vous aimez le style déjanté."

1,"excellent album!!!!! pour tous ceux qui connaissent vraiment rien aux productions rapologiques de maintenant. lyricalement: il y a tjr des bons passages mais pas de koi vivre une révolution psycholique, musicalement: à part essayer de faire sonner une MPC3000 incolore ( et une SP1200 mal utilisé!) aux rythmes saccadés et indigestes r'n b, il y a aucune originalité la dedans, tout est insipide...aucune nuance dans les samples sélectionnés et joués, techniquement c'est zéro ( c fini de faire tourner juste un sample 5 minutes) bref du travail de retraité. très déçu...mais je m'y attendais. avec toutes les productions en carton que nous sortait AKH, il fallait s'attendre à un album pizza hut. il n'a pas fait l'effet de la canicule... au revoir au printemps? je dirai même adieu fin été."
4,"Superbe cd avec des bons rythmes qu'on pourrait fredonner toute la journée. Des guitares à la Ben Harper, une voix splendide, bref, une reussite."
5,"rien à jeter, tout est génial. song is over est à mon sens 1 peu en dessous, mais tout le reste est de l' or à l' état pur. les chansons apres won't get fooled again ne faisaient pas partie de l' album original, mais certaines sont néammoins excellentes (naked eye et too much of anything)."
2,"J'aime pas le rock progressif. Qui est à la musique classique ce que la Nationale IV est à la Champion's League. Et au rock l'équivalent d'un furoncle sur le nez de Miss France. Déjà, à ce stade du commentaire, les ayatollahs défenseurs de leur chapelle et sûrs de leur bon goût on cliqué sur un vote défavorable, et sont repartis se prosterner devant l'affiche de la tournée Yes de 1971. Pour ceux qui restent, je dirais que ELP est un des très rares (avec King Crimson) à sauver. Parce qu'un des rares groupes de la « tendance » d'être capable d'écrire ... des chansons, tout simplement, ces machins avec des couplets, un refrain, et un petit solo qui ne dure pas dix-huit minutes ...  Oh, certes ELP ne fait pas ça tout le temps. Ils ne peuvent pas s'empêcher de tartiner des plages interminables de leur technique vaine et de leur virtuosité gratuite (« Tarkus » le morceau-titre et ses sept « mouvements »). Il faut dire que le groupe est plombé par Keith Emerson. Jouissant d'une belle réputation quand il martyrisait  (volontairement) son Hammond avec les Nice, il a fini par se prendre pour Mozart et Bach (plagié mais crédité sur « The only way ») réunis. Et à mon humble avis de pas connaisseur, c'est souvent Greg Lake (transfuge de King Crimson) qui sauve la baraque. La seconde moitié du Cd est souvent intéressante et se conclut par un pastiche de rock'n'roll à la Jerry Lee Lewis qui prouve que les ELP avaient (parfois) de l'humour. Edition remastérisée mais sans bonus. Donc pour les remix techno et les versions dub de « Tarkus » il faudra encore patienter."
4,"Enregistré en 1975 à Monté Carlo, ce cd varie entre folk et hard rock. Le son remastérisé met encore plus en avance les solos de  guitares, flute et surtout la voix quasi ""opéra"" de Sir Anderson (l""album précédent War child, étant totalement envouté par cette voix au meilleur de sa puissance). Chaque morceaux ou ""suite"" comme ""Baker st muse"" est une perle."
5,"Ce DVD remémorisee bien le souvenir d'un excellent concert à Lyon ce même mois d'octobre 2008. Ici, c'es en Pologne, avec un public plutôt sage et bien assis : ce n'était pas le cas en France, mais nous on a eu la chance de la ""descente"" du maestro vers son public lors de ""it's only me"".... le frisson assuré bien sür!!! C'est le témoignage de 30 ans de carrière d'un groupe avec des hauts et des bas qui, contemporains de Marillion, n'ont pas eu la chance d'une notoriété immédiate à défaut de n'avoir sorti le disque d'anthologie dans les années 80 (script for a jester's tears pour Marillion) et peut- être de n'avoir pas eu un chanteur du charisme de Fish. Le groupe est éminemment sympathique sur scène et ce d'autant plus avec le nouveau batteur assez extraverti, Scott Higham, mais parfois aussi un peu lourd dans son jeu (Breaking the spell).  On ne peut qu'admirer sans réserves la performance et l'immense talent de compositeur, chanteur, guitariste, âme de Pendragon, Nick Barrett. Une voix unique et un jeu de guitare tout aussi unique, sans esbrouffe, et toujours terriblement poignant : il y a ici foison de solos et la caméra capte bien le doigté de l'artiste. La prise de son est excellente. Avec Pure le groupe a acquis une certaine reconnaissance de la presse prog, au bout de 30 ans quand mëme,et a aussi sûrement élargi voire rajeunit son public avec une touche plus métal. Un choix qui peut-être discutable mais qui leur a réussi."
5,"Todd s'est dépassé sur ce disque, les chansons douces sont certainement les plus tendres qui soient pour l'oreille (d'un mélomane averti ?)"
2,"Version de 1970 en cinq actes de 3 heures et demie avec Domingo et Caballé. Heureusement Domingo est encore jeune (30 ans) mais son interprétation est déjà routinière. Celle de Caballé est impersonnelle, Raimondi rate Philippe II et Giulini n'est pas à la hauteur de son enregistrement en public à Covent Garden en 1958."
2,"Le CD doit-il nécessairement immortaliser toutes les soiréees d'opéra qui sommeillent dans les bandes sonores des radios? C'est la question que l'on est en droit de se poser après l'écoute de ce ""Fidélio"" donné à l'Opéra de Vienne en 1962.Ni Karajan,le maître d'oeuvre,ni la troupe parfaite des""troupiers""(Paskalis,Waechter,Berry,Kmentt-et deux interprêtes féminines d'exception-une Ludwig,terrorisée par le rôle de Léonore,mais qui arrive à le vaincre malgré quelques aigus hurlés et une toute jeunette de même pas 25 ans d'âge qui campe une Marzelline drôlement décidée et délicieuse vocalement-gundula Janowitz!!!),ne sont en cause.C'est Vickers,oui,le grand Vickers qui ce soir là,est défaillant.Le timbre de sa voix dès le ""Gott""qui suit le prélude orchestral du deuxième acte est totalement méconnaissable et il devra lutter jusqu'au final contre un instrument rebelle.Chapeau bas,Monsieur l'immense ténor que vous êtes d'avoir crânement assuré et assumé votre rôle ce soir là,mais ,permettez que l'on continue de vous écouter dans l'enregistrement de studio réalisé cette même année sous la direction d'Otto Klemperer,ou de vous admirer dans le film de Pierre Jourdan  (DVD disponible à l'étanger).Ce 6 août 1977,sous la voûte étoilée provençale,à Orange,vous fûtes tout simplement prodigieux!"
5,"Pour son seul opéra, achevé en 1848, Schumann illustra un sujet médiéval : l'histoire de Geneviève de Brabant telle qu'adaptée dans le drame psychologique qu'en tira Friedrich Hebbel. La passion rabrouée de Golo pour la jeune épouse du Comte Siegfried, parti en guerre auprès de Charles Martel, est victime de ses complots. Bien que son traître amoureux ait voulu la faire accuser d'une calomnieuse infidélité, Geneviève échappera à la vengeance de son mari, d'abord abusé par les subterfuges magiques de la nourrice. Quand celle-ci sera poussée au remords par le spectre de l'intendant du château, assassiné par intrigue, elle préviendra Siegfried de l'innocence de Geneviève, et l'Evêque pourra finalement célébrer leur intacte union. Tel est l'argument que Schumann représenta au Stadttheater de Leipzig en juin 1850. Malgré sa musicalité et ses thèmes typiquement romantiques (ingénuité en proie aux passions humaines, cadre moyenâgeux, intervention du fantastique, forêt comme décor du dénouement...), cette création n'y rencontra qu'un succès d'estime et ne s'est jamais vraiment imposée dans le répertoire lyrique. Grâce à ses qualités de cantate dramatique, l'oeuvre peut se dispenser de la scène sans perdre sa signification, et s'avère très crédible pour une écoute discographique. L'enregistrement que réalisa Kurt Masur en 1976 est longtemps resté sans concurrence. L'excellence de sa distribution vocale (Edda Moser, Peter Schreier, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau !), l'éloquence du Rundfunkchor de Berlin (le choeur qui accompagne le départ de Siegfried est magnifique!), l'implication d'un orchestre de haute tradition (celui du Gewandhaus) : tout cela signe une interprétation rayonnante de sensibilité et d'efficacité dramaturgique. Le Finale de l'Acte I, avec le duo de Golo et Marguerite, est particulièrement flamboyant. Mais c'est tout le spectacle qui s'anime ici sans jamais laisser l'intérêt faiblir, et pourfend l'opinion selon laquelle le compositeur se serait fourvoyé dans cet opéra... La notice de l'album inclut un commentaire de présentation et le synopsis (traduits en Français) ainsi que le texte du livret, en Allemand seulement. A noter que les plages des CD, correspondant aux scènes, bénéficient aussi d'une indexation. Splendide prise de son, comme toujours chez ce label."
2,"Snoop est un peu le Bill Gates du hip hop, peut importe ce qu'il fait bon ou mauvais ça se vend. Cet opus a un contenu assez diverse mais devient vite lassant surtout la prod. des Neptunes, sans aucune inovation! Un hommage a Johnny Cash (Un Blunt de trop peut etre ?)un morceau usurpé a Prince, bref le cd se transforme vite en ramasse poussiere.Cet Album est reservé au inconditionnel du Dogg."
2,"comment lancer sa carriere sur les cendres d'un groupe mythique...voila la question a poser a mr rod stewart et son ami ron wood, la reponse vous la connaissez. steve marriot vient de quitter le groupe pour fonder apple pie, ronnie lane se retrouve bien seul et engage ron wood, qui fait venir son ami rod, chanteur alors du jeff beck band, et la pauvre ronnie c'est le debut de la fin, car la vraie tragedie est que notre ami rod suit 2 carrieres paralleles, les faces et la sienne en solo. ses meilleures chansons, sont dans ses propres albums. les faces ne sont qu'un groupe moyen avec les chansons qui vont avec. ronnie mourra sans le sous...seul...""all or nothing"" telle etait la devise des small faces...achetez les 1ers small faces, de la bombe, par le plus grand groupe rythm &amp; blues blanc...pour steve &amp; ronnie...for the mods..."
2,"La musique de Carla Bley, sur une trame littéraire de l'écrivain Paul Haines, donne une œuvre copieuse de plus de deux heures, sortie à l'origine au travers d'un triple 33 T. Œuvre copieuse mais quelque peu indigeste. Pianiste reconnue de jazz, Carla Bley explore ici beaucoup d'autres horizons : musique contemporaine, classique, baroque, cabaret style Kurt Weill, pop, blues,... .  Une armada éclectique d'invités prestigieux (John McLaughlin, Jack Bruce, Don Cherry, Linda Ronstadt, ... ) est de l'aventure. L'entreprise est ambitieuse, le résultat pas toujours à la hauteur (les longs morceaux au début et à la fin sont particulièrement pénibles) et cette œuvre avant-gardiste aujourd'hui quelque peu datée et dépassée risque fort de ne satisfaire aucun des amateurs des multiples genres abordés."
5,"Des compils comme ça, y a que les Stones pour les pondre, évidemment... Pas un déchet, du blues, du ' n'B, des pépites ""pop"", ce disque tourne depuis des années sans jamais fatiguer! Un must total!!"
5,"En 1965,les beatles commencent vraiment a ecrire des chansons extraordinaires qui peuvent porter le nom de ""chef d'oeuvre"" ,car sur la face consacree au  film eponyme ,john sort le grand jeu avec ""help""qui au passage est une des meilleures chansons  des beatles ""you've got to hide your love away"" et ticket to ride""ne sont pas loins derriere,mac cartneyfait moins fort avec ""the night before"" et ""another girl"",george signe une belle chanson pop destinee a qui l'on sait""i need you"". par contre sur l'autre face d'origine,c'est paul qui met la barre haute avec deux merveilles""i've just seen a face"" et ""yesterday"",les beatles maitrisent plus les techniques de studio et essayent de trouver d'autres sons en utilisant d'autres instruments que guitares basse et batterie d'ou la nouvelle orientation naissante ,il s'agit ici d'un album pivot ,je me demande si le disque aurait ete encore meilleur en remplacant ""it's only love"" par ""yes it  is"" et ""dizzy miss lizzy"" par ""i'm down"" a vous de juger.pascal49"
2,"L'écoute de l'extrait de la chanson ""help"" que vous proposez fait référence à la version courante de cette chanson. Pouvez-vous cependant m'assurer que la version contenu sur le CD est bien l'originale, c'est-à-dire la version COMPLETE avec l'introuction musicale ? Vous en remerciant par avance"
1,"Il n'y a pas grand chose à sauver de ces petites ritournelles d'une banalité affligeante. Yann Tiersen est un musicien limité , ce n'est pas nouveau, et ses plates orchestrations sur des harmonies pauvres ne font que renforcer cette opinion. encore une fois, une BO que le public écoute avec les yeux et pas avec les oreilles..."
2,"Ce film est d'une nullité crasse. A partir de l'histoire de Robin des bois, les scénaristes ont inventé une adaptation qui aurait pu tenir la route en tant que film d'action si deux éléments ne venait pas gâcher tout l'ensemble. Le premier est l'intervention de la sorcellerie venant contaminer l'environnement de l'Eglise, et en particulier le chanoine. Débile, absurde et venant cracher inutilement sur une histoire très dévoyée. Le second, alter-mondialisme aidant, et culpabilisation de l'homme blanc également, l'intervention d'un Maure dans cette histoire, représenté comme celui qui a la sagesse, le calme, la science et tout le folklore que l'on veut bien véhiculer là-dessus. Vous l'avez compris : le Moyen-Age est vu comme une période sombre et obtuse, faisant partir des hommes en croisade injustement alors que ces pauvres Maures sont de gentils petits gars bien comme il faut. Rien n'est plus faux du point de vue historique. Les acteurs jouent honnêtement, reconnaissons-le, bien que dans des pauses trop théâtrales. On peut légitimement recommander d'autres versions de Robin des bois, dont bien sûr celle du grand Errol Flynn ( )."
1,"Je pensais avoir acheté la musique du film mais ce n'est pas du tout cela. Certaines sont effectivement dans le film mais d'autre en sont inspirées. Il faut acheter le CD de Thomas Newman pour vraiment se retrouver plongé dans l'univers de ce merveilleux film ! Si vous pensez y trouver la célèbre musique ""The Rhythm Of The Horse"", ne la cherchez pas, elle n'y est pas !"
1,"traddutore, tradditore...Cher Maxime, améliorez votre diction, votre jeu à la guitare, accompagnez-vous au moins d'une contrebasse, ne parlez point trop vite...les quelques musiques faites par Jean Bertola sonnent rapidement très ""faux"" aux oreilles des amoureux de Georges...qui lui même n'est plus le seigneur, l'astre solaire de naguère, apparaissant soudain sans guère d'imagination...un échec"
4,"tres bel album,mais dommage que l'on ne retrouve pas la fraîcheur du tout premier CD (""tété"").Et surtout,je conseille aux internautes d'aller l'applaudir en concert,c'est 100 fois mieux."
4,"J'ai eu la chance de découvrir Snow Patrol au stade de France, en première partie du concert de U2,j'ai trouvé le groupe très bien, je me suis donc précipitée sur l'album ""Final Straw"", j'ai adoré. Dès que celui-ci est sortie, je me le suis procuré et il suit le précédent. Des mélodies agréables à écouter, bien chantées. Bref un album fort plaisant."
5,"Les avant-guardistes ne jouissent que rarement de la reconaissance qu'ils meritent, et ne s'offrent toujours qu'aux jazzophiles avertis et sensibles. Miles lui meme en a longtemps fais la douloureuse experience."
1,"personnellement je n'aime pas du tout ni la voix, ni les paroles, ni la musique !!!"
5,"Bénies soient les années 90 pour leur richesse musicale... The Young Gods est un de ces groupe qui n'a jamais connu la reconnaissance qu'il méritait.Resté plus ou moins dans l'ombre d'autres ""leaders""  depuis leurs débuts très rock-indus (CF 1er album éponyme, teintés d'influences on ne peut plus variées, écoutez par ex.""Charlotte"" sur ""l'eau Rouge""),la formation n'a cessé de creuser plus profondément dans l'essence de la musique électronique pour peaufiner un style unique, mélange de rythmes explosifs et de samples hypnotiques couplées à des riffs de guitares ascérées, d'un chant aux textes poétiques (en français, anglais et parfois allemand)oscillant entre murmure et envolées sur-vitaminées et de connotations ""folks"" omniprésentes. En clair, une écoute d'ensemble de la discographie s'impose... ""Only Heaven"", déjà dans le titre, invite l'auditeur à pénétrer l'univers hypnotique parallèle de ce combo hors du commun. Cet album est à conseiller à tout ""débutant"" à la langue ""Young Gods"", de par l'aspect percutant de certains morceaux (Speed of night, Kissing the sun!!!) et la beauté innocente d'autres morceaux plus calmes (""Child in a tree""). Fans de rock indus en l'occurence NIN (la musique peut rappeler NIN mais l'esprit est beaucoup moins torturé), plongez dans cet album ou vous découcrirez un univers mélancholico-energico-fusionnel-blablabla aussi passionnant qu'intimement indispensable... Un album qui fait du bien, et permet d'enchainer sur le reste de la discographie notamment l'excellentissime ""TV Sky"" et le très électro ""Second Nature""."
2,"Le 3ème album de Tricky n'est finalement que la suite logique de Pre Millénium Tension. Une chute brutal vers les méandres de la folie. On aurait aimé pouvoir le suivre mais le trip-hopeur ne fait rien pour nous en donner l'envie. Au lieu de cela, les titres se suivent et se ressemblent et l'aspect expérimental apparait comme rebutant. ...Tricky n'aurait-il pas fait exprès de saboter ce disque ?..."
2,"Un savant Trip-Hop de ""Dan the Automator"" avec des samples électro-instrumentaux variés que l'on préfère tout de même écouter avec le Rap de ""Del tha Funky Homosapien"" sur l'album ""State Of The Nation"" et ses 21 pistes. ""Things you can do"" / ""Positive Contact"" / ""Memory Loss"" sont d'un point de vue personnel les hits de l'auteur. On ne regrette pas l'achat."
1,"Ca part un peu dans la gonflette tout ça... Une soi-disant énergie qui reste plate. Bon d'accord la pochette reste originale, ok, si vous voulez. Et après ?"
4,"Dido nous reviens avec un nouvel album frais et agréable a écouter. Mais on se rend compte que les mélodies sont certe très envoutante mais pas assez ""bounce"".  Quelques titres bien calibrés auraient permis une meilleur diversification.  Ca reste du bon du très bon à ecouter sans modérations!!!"
1,"rarement un artiste avec des paroles aussi niaises aura été élevé au rang de poète. Comment avec des telles paroles, une voix aussi faussement travaillée vers la fausse note peut-il être qualifé de talent ? on peut aimer, bien sûr, mais il ne faut surtout pas dire qu'il chante bien, que c'est rock, ou que c'est un pur poète. SVP un peu de bon sens."
5,"J'ai découvert cet album cet été et chaque jour je lui découvre de nouveaux talents. ma soeur me l'a fait connaitre car elle les connait depuis longtemps. On s'accroche a une ou deux chansons au début mais ensuite on peut plus s'en passer. La vie est représentée sous différent angle mais en reste tout aussi véridique. Sublime. Un joyau du genre. J'ai regretté de ne pas avoir connu Third Eye Blind auparavant. Alors ne faites pas mon erreur, mettez-y vous TOUT DE SUITE !"
4,"Textes tranchants parfois durs , faites attention ce ne sont que des textes et ce n'est que son avis sur une situation quelque peu critique .Le rappeur arrive à impressioner par sa technique parolière ( jeux de mots , sonorités redondantes ) et son flow (desormais  plagié ) .La production est interessante , alliée a des featurings aussi enrichissant qu'etonnants parce que les protagonistes sont tous novices ( sauf ALI ) , bonne ecoute ..."
1,"Les thèmes sont les mêmes que d'habitude : d'un côté les jeunes de banlieu, maillots de joueur de basket, casquettes, ils disent qu'ils vivent dans la pauvreté, et de l'autre chaines en or, muscles, voitures, belles maisons et filles, toujours des problèmes.... Comme idée de départ ça peut être intéressant, mais l'utiliser sans la faire évoluer, un peu nul. On retrouve la même chose aux etats-unis. Donc écouter ça uniquement pour vous faire une idée de se qui se fait de plus nul, et vous arriverez enfin à écouter autre chose, plutot que de danser dessus."
5,"Quatrième album très réussi ( après le très bon aussi Dropping the Writ en 2007 ) de ce songwriter américain un peu marginal et en tout cas méconnu ici .  Il a suffi d'une superbe love song , ""Dreams Come True Girl"" , pour qu'on commence à le citer comme un des auteurs qui compte dans le paysage si touffu de la musique folk américaine . Mais Cass McCombs dépasse allègrement les frontières de cet univers balisé : il fait mieux qu'être un élément de renouveau ( comme si cette musique , d'ailleurs éternelle , en avait besoin ! ) il est aussi porteur d'une part de cette ""américanité"" vadrouilleuse et élégante qui le rend immédiatement familier et sympathique à nos oreilles et à nos yeux . Il n'y a qu'à voir sa tête de petite frappe faussement sage sur certaines photos ( un mix de Matt Dillon et de Steve Earle à ses débuts ) pour savoir que ce gars d'un peu plus de trente ans n'est pas là pour n'être qu'un pion de plus dans le circuit de la grande fabrique de chansons américaines : il risque de nous épater encore longtemps .  Les onze titres sont formidables : mes coups de coeur vont à la première déjà citée , ""Dreams Come True Girl"" , très sexy , avec un son un peu caverneux et ancien ( réverb' ! ) qui la fait sonner comme une sorte de petit classique , auréolé ici par la présence de l'actrice ( et chanteuse aussi à ses heures ) Karen Black , ""Harmonia"" ( 6 mn d'élégance et de ""ligne claire"" country pleine de délicatesse ) ""You Saved My Life"" , assez magnifique , et le très beau aussi ""My Sister , My Spouse"" ..."
5,"Beaucoup plus conforme que les versions transcrites pour violoncelle et piano ou pour flûte et piano, cette présente interprétation de la Sonate en la mineur de Franck ainsi que son complément, nous valent d'assister à un parfait échange entre deux artistes assujettis par deux incontestables chef-d’œuvres. Cette relation fusionnelle est magnifiée par une prise de son d’une pureté, d’une dynamique et d’une richesse de timbres inégalées. Elle inventorie tout le potentiel harmonique de l’alto et démontre aisément de ses particularités sonores au sein de la famille des cordes. Un idéal rapport de puissance est conservé avec le piano. La dimension des instruments et leur placement sont perçus sans difficulté et les enceintes ont disparu pour laisser le champ libre aux musiciens. Cette performance technique parachève l’indéniable réussite artistique de ce disque."
4,"Wolfgang Rihm composa sa pièce pour ensemble instrumental ""Jagden und Formen"" à partir d'autres de ses compositions (""Gejagte Forme"", ""Gedrängte Form"" &amp; ""Verbrogene Formen"". Rihm écrit ses partitions selon un procédé assez complexe. En effet, il peut revenir sur une oeuvre composée quelqes années auparavant pour la modifier, l'imbriquer dans une autre, pour avoir un résultat tout neuf ; il peut commencer par la fin de sa nouvelle oeuvre pour finir avec le matériau du début. ""Jagden und Formen"" (""Chasses et Formes"") peut être assimilée à une poursuite haletante, une cavalcade très rythmée. Chaque instrument ou groupe d'instrument est traité avec la plus grande science : cor anglais pour les passages lyriques, marimba obsessionnels rappelant Steve Reich, cuivres pour arrondir les angles sonores, harpe pour colorer la mélodie... L'oeuvre est d'une virtuosité rythmique incroyable. L'Ensemble Modern, commanditaire de cette oeuvre, et rompu à ce style de répertoire, donne le meilleur de lui-même sous la houlette de Dominique My et du compositeur (qui participa à l'enregistrement). Mention spéciale au cor anglais de Catherine Milliken très virtuose et aux autres vents qui, dans leurs passages, semblent au bord de l'apnée !!"
5,"Le succès de ""La Création"" et ses ""Saisons"" a éclipsé le premier oratorio de Joseph Haydn, d'une belle variété de climats et très théâtral : on a davantage affaire à l'opéra qu'à un oratorio au sens premier du terme. Andreas Spering, à la tête d'un effectif modeste, lui donne un souffle épique. Il bénéficie d'un plateau vocal jeune qui fait preuve d'un véritable engagement.  Merci à Naxos de nous révéler une oeuvre splendide tant sur le plan vocal qu'instrumental."
2,"Premièrement le support est du 24/96. Et pour la petite particularité historique, ""Antar"" fut le premier enregistrement stéréophonique de la société DECCA. A bientot pour un commentaire sur l'écoute."
2,"Depuis Reinhardt Goebel, il est devenu de bon ton de faire parcourir la musique dite baroque d'un bon coup de vent hystérique. Cette hystérie est devenue une mode et comme toutes les modes, elles passera, seuls les très grands resteront. Je crois depuis longtemps que Pierre Hantaï fait partie des grands, j'espère que ce ferraillage outrancier qui n'apporte rien à Scarlatti n'est qu'un faux pas. Ce disque me semble réservé aux inconditionnels de Pierre Hantaï ou ceux qui veulent à tout prix se faire secouer les oreilles. Bien sûr, ce disque a reçu des tonnes d'éloges, il s'agit en fait du syndrome René Martin, l'éditeur de ce disque et initiateur de magnifiques manifestations devenues incontournables. Que la profession salue René Marin, ce n'est que justice, qu'elle salue par deux fois ses deux premiers et très quelconques disques, cela devient douteux et ne risque pas de relancer une industrie du disque fort mal en point ... (Le premier disque était celui du contre-ténor Carlos Mena dont la plupart des mêmes critiques jugeait la voix et les prestations quelconques voire mauvaises avant d'enregistrer chez Mirare, étonnant, non ?)"
2,"On peut affubler les technologies modernes d'enregistrement de certains sigles (DSD, SBM, 24 bit stream etc...)mais le present enregistrement est terne, brouillon, le son des cordes diffus, filtré....On peut se demander pourquoi avoir dénaturé la prise de son à ce point? Le resultat est mediocre, ce qui est encore plus dommageable si on considere que l'interpretation de Perahia etait bonne, alerte et bien menée! Quel gachis! Sony devrait revoir et surtout mieux controler leur production sinon c'est au détriment de l'interprete et du consomateur. Si je note bien, je ne suis pas le seul a avoir remarqué cette anomalie!"
5,"Manon Lescaut est souvent considéré comme une oeuvre ""de jeunesse"", encore inabouti, de Puccini. La durée et la complication du travail du compositeur et de ses librettistes en serait une preuve. C'est oublier que les mêmes difficultés à trouver des librettistes qui satisfassent Puccini et à aboutir à la continuité dramatique et musicale qu'il ambitionnait se sont reproduites jusqu'à ses derniers ouvrages, ainsi que les repentirs dictés par la réaction du public. Madama Butterfly a-t-elle d'ailleurs jamais atteint cet idéal néo-wagnérien que poursuivait Puccini ? Certaines transitions restent passablement arbitraires dans le deuxième acte. De ce point de vue, le découpage de l'action de Manon Lescaut en quatre actes entre lesquels subsistent des ellipses abyssales est à mon avis une réussite plus qu'un échec, chaque acte étant parfaitement unitaire. Les coq-à-l'âne d'acte en acte sont également une force plus qu'une faiblesse, car par eux l'opéra de Puccini nous parle dans le langage des rêves : des épisodes ayant disparu, on a ainsi l'impression que des Grieux et Manon ne se retrouvent pas au milieu du désert par une suite accidentelle de leur punition, mais que c'est leur punition elle-même. La musique, enfin, est d'une puissance eceptionnelle, remarquablement graduée jusqu'au dernier acte, et qui échappe par son expressivité radicale à l'aspect conventionnel que les autres opéras de Puccini n'évitent pas toujours. Ce coffret mérite sans doute d'être considéré à la fois comme une des grandes réussites de Sinopoli au disque et comme un des très grands enregistrements d'un opéra de Puccini, le seul peut-être avec la fameuse Tosca de De Sabata à n'encourir absolument aucun reproche. Sinopoli assume pleinement la structure de Manon Lescaut dans sa force onirique à laquelle je faisais référence. Cela implique à la fois une caractérisation très différenciée des actes, depuis le marivaudage du premier jusqu'à la noirceur époustouflante des deux derniers, et de semer assez tôt les graines de la tragédie finale. C'est exactement ce que fait Sinopoli, qui fait entrer du ton parfois rêveur du deuxième acte une mélancolie prémonitoire et trouve dans les 3° et 4° actes des couleurs orchestrales saisissantes et surtout des tempi et des phrasés indiscutables, évidents. Toute l'équipe vocale est assez idéale, essentiellement Domingo et Freni, et chante préisément dans les phrasés du chef. C'est cette union du chant vocal et du chant orchestral, en plus de l'adéquation des chanteurs et de la justesse de la conception du chef, qui fait les très grandes réussites à l'opéra."
5,"Cela fait maintenant des décennies que l'industrie du disque a vendu son âme au diable des distributions internationales où tout le monde chante n'importe quoi pourvu que des noms ronflants fleurissent sur les pochettes. L'opéra français demeurant mondialement marginal, notre école nationale de chant s'en est retrouvé de facto étouffée et nous sommes régulièrement confrontés à des interprètes peut-être illustres, mais dont le français nous échappe. Faut-il être bon public pour ne pas s'esclaffer quand tel ténor avoue non pas avoir 'tué' mais 'touyé' (qui s'écrit 'touillé' dans la langue de Molière) Carmen: 'C'est moi qui l'ai touillée' entend-on couramment... Tout ceci pour vous faire comprendre la valeur de cet enregistrement idiomatique qui bénéficie de surcroît d'une prise de son stéréo correcte. La diction est pour une fois irréprochable, au point que l'on s'étonnerait presque, vu le contexte, que les protagonistes n'aient point l'accent provençal; et comme la voix de Renée Doria fait merveille dans le rôle titre, que Robert Massard est impressionnant en Ourrias, que Solange Michel nous offre une Taven proprement idéale, que les autres personnages sont parfaitement incarnés et que les choeurs et l'orchestre symphonique de Paris sont présents au rendez-vous sous la baguette attentive de Jésus Etcheverry, je ne regretterai que le timbre à mes yeux fort ingrat de Michel Sénéchal; mais vous pouvez en juger autrement sur ce point, d'autant que notre ténor connaît lui aussi parfaitement les ressources de la langue dans laquelle il chante."
2,"J'ai écouté le Cid de Massent; qu'el dommage qu'il n'y ai pas eut de Verdi chez lui- Des passages d'une beautée géniale dans certaines scène Mais qu'elle gachie pour le reste - Massent était imcappable de composer des scène de masses , aucune inspiration pour les choeurs et les voies de basses, si bien que la plupart des opéras de Massenet sont inégales- Ce qui aurait put etre un chef d'oeuvre comme aurait put l'etre Esclamonde en est réduit a une écoute d'un opéra ou l'on doit beaucoup sauter de plages, de passages entier- Bref Massent était fait pour composer des airs pour voie de femme ' c'est tout- Dans tout le reste on peut dire qu'il était vraiment mais alors vraiment pas doué- A retenie ""noble lame étincelante avec choeur et une continuation dans cet air qui est une trouvaille spectaculaire(du fin génie)- Il y a encore l'air de Chimène , ici chanté par Grace Bunbry d'une manière miraculeuse puis quelques autres airs mais sans plus , d'ailleurs comme tous les opéras de ce compositeur qui plait mais qui comme Saint-Saens le disait ""sans profondeur- vraiment qu'l dommage...qu'el saccage...meme pas savoir composer des scènes de masse ou meme ne serait ce d'un choeur - Christophan"
5,Un très très grand ténor qu'on ne se lasse pas d'entendre... CD à acheter sans se poser de questions.
2,"René Jacobs opte une nouvelle fois pour une version ouvertement théâtrale de l'opéra mozartien qu'il justifie dans le livret qui accompagne les deux CD. 1. Il faut reconnaître sa volonté de revenir à la partition et l'importance accordée au texte (les chanteurs ""chantent bien"" et soignent leur élocution mais ne peuvent prétendre à aucune séduction vocale). 2. L'exhubérance de la direction, les contastes outranciers des timbres et cette manie du ""détail qui tue"" qui caractérisent la direction du chef allemand rendent pénible l'écoute de cette ultime oeuvre de Mozart. Il est difficile de faire preuve de clémence envers cette Clemenza mal aîmée du répertoire mozartien.  Heureusement, les interprétations de qualité ne manquent pas : Istvan Kertesz en 1968 avec une sublime Tereza Berganza (Decca), John Eliot Gardiner en 1990 (Archiv) et Christopher Hogwood en 1991 avec Cecilia Bartoli bouleversante d'émotion (L'Oiseau Lyre)."
5,"Il y aura bientôt trente ans que le quatuor de Prague enregistrait la première véritable intégrale des quatuors de Dvorak, avec en prime les Cyprès, mélodies de jeunesse renversantes de fraîcheur et de spontaneité bohémiennes, réorchestrées pour les quatre instruments, qui traduisent à merveille les tendres et mélancoliques réminiscences du compositeur.Si les versions du corpus pour quatuor du grand Tchèque sont maitenant légion, on reste pantois de bonheur à l'audition du Quatuor de Prague, dont l'enregistrement n'a pas pris une ride, si ce n'est celles , volontaires, qu'y a inscrite le compositeur lui même à l'approche d'une vieillesse  que n'épargnèrent point les épreuves. Les récents enregistrements des Prazak sont parmi les seuls à pouvoir se confronter à cette somme, plus tranchants peut être,en même temps plus immédiatements ""boisés"", eux aussi terriblement tchèques, avec ce léger surcroit de souci du détail sonore qui signe parfois presque négativement l'approche de certains quatuors modernes finissant par trop oblitérer le flux rhapsodique  de cette musique. Les Janacek, en leur temps, les Vlach ,les Talich, pour en rester aux formations tchèques, ne déméritent pas mais se cantonnent le plus souvent aux derniers quatuors( 12, 13, 14),comme on se cantonne encore trop souvent aujourd'hui aux trois dernières symphonies. Les Stamitz, seuls véritables concurrents pour une intégrale, sont trop loin du compte: ils ne trouvent pas l'équilibre miraculeux du Quatuor de Prague dans les quatuors de jeunesse, gorgés d'une sève mélodique que Dvorak saura un peu plus tard encore mieux maîtriser.Conscient de ce trop plein, ils édulcorent par souci analytique une musique qui s'adresse en tout premier lieu au coeur de celui qui l'écoute...A ce ""petit jeu"", le Quatuor de Prague demeure à jamais irremplaçable."
2,Quel dommage que le report ait été fait de manière si mauvaise. Il est bien regrettable qu'une maison comme EMI n'ait pas fait appel à de meilleurs ingénieurs du son.  Beaucoup de ces enregistrements ont déjà fait l'objet de reports de bien meilleure qualité.
2,"Bartoli a tout intérêt à choisir ce genre d'orchestre car elle ne dépasserait pas le 3eme rang avec un orchestre dit traditionnel. Quant à ces choix de rôle récents, ils lorgnent de plus en plus vers des emplois de soprano lyrico-colorature hors de sa portée sur scène. Ce sont des créations de studio, artificelles. On est loin des magnifiques disques qu'elle avait produits il y a quelques années (Vivaldi, Salieri...). Il y a d'autres somnanbules au disques beaucoup plus passionantes (Callas, Sutherland, Dessay)."
5,"Si l'Acis et Galathée de Haendel n'est pas comparable à celui de Lully, il faut reconnaître que sous la direction de W. Christie il prend une tonalité toute différente de celle à laquelle on c'était (malheureusement ?) habitué. En donnant priorité à la musique et aux subtiltés des sentiments que recéle l'écriture de Haendel, les Arts Florissant poursuivent une ""re-visitation"" des oeuvres baroques à ne manquer pour rien au monde. En plus quand il s'agit de Haendel il n'y à rien de plus à dire..."
5,"Un jeune homme à couper le souffle. Ces airs de Rossini sont un vrai régal, une telle précision vocale, une technique parfaite : trilles, arpèges, staccatos, une aisance dans tout le registre. Un chant fluide et tout en rondeur, aucunes aspirations ou coups de glotte généralement utilisés pour se faciliter la tâche. Son interprétation de l'air du comte dans le Barbier de Séville ""Cessa di più resistere"" est un pur moment de virtuosité.  Un disque indispensable pour tous les amoureux du Bel Canto et des airs de ténors rossinien."
2,"Qu'il est beau, le jeune péruvien ! On voudrait bien l'inviter chez soi après une première, histoire de réviser un peu son solfège... En tout cas c'est l'effet qu'il m'a fait quand je l'ai vu la première fois sur scène. En passant j'avais apprécié tout de même la belle rondeur de son timbre et sa rayonnante aisance dans les registres les plus périlleux. Au disque l'effet n'est, hélas, pas le même. Dépourvu d'une palette de couleurs suffisante, prononçant assez mal l'italien (avec des ""s"" et des ""c"" durs qui dénoncent ses origines hispano-américaines) le ténor tant admiré ne fait pas mouche. C'est la fantaisie qui lui manque, et Dieu sait si elle est indispensable dans ce répertoire fait de trois notes qui se courent après, et dans le même ordre. Franchement je trouve cette performance très décevante, par rapport à ce que le très, peut-être trop, jeune artiste arrive à donner ""sur le vif"". La faute en revient peut-être à sa projection vocale, très généreuse, et à l'éloignement excessif du micro, qui met en valeur le vibrato excessivement serré du chanteur. En somme : Florez est l'inverse de Bartoli. Alors que cette dernière est inaudible ou presque au théâtre, le chanteur péruvien trébuche au disque sur sa limite majeure : l'incapacité de calibrer une voix de diamant encore à l'état brut."
5,"Vingt-trois ans après la monumentale ""Turangalîla-Symphonie"" (1948), ""Des canyons aux étoiles"" renoua avec l'idée d'une vaste fresque mystique pour orchestre et piano, ce dernier se voyant en outre ici confié d'exigeants passages solistes. Commandée pour commémorer le bicentenaire de la fondation des Etats-Unis, cette partition extatique s'inspire des édifiantes beautés du paysage américain pour célébrer l'amour divin via les mystères de la Création. La contemplation du gigantesque amphithéâtre sédimentaire de Cedar Breaks, des surprenantes pointes rocheuses qui hérissent le Bryce Canyon et des falaises de Zion Park ont puissamment stimulé l'imaginaire du compositeur qui avait pour l'occasion effectué le voyage dans l'Utah. Divers chants d'oiseaux stylisés (les orioles, la grive des bois, et d'autres espèces hawaïennes...) furent entremêlés à ces visions géologiques pour former une allégorie musicale en douze tableaux chatoyants, qui regardent le ciel et interrogent le cosmos théologique (écoutez l'inquiétant « appel interstellaire » confié au cor solo !) L'inspiration ornithologique de Messiaen s'était déjà manifestée dans le plumage multicolore des ""Oiseaux exotiques"" (1955) pour piano, vents et percussions. Les ""Couleurs de la Cité céleste"" (1963) sont une autre mosaïque sonore qui médite sur les images associées à l'Apocalypse. Enregistrées en 1988 sous la baguette de Esa-Pekka Salonen dont l'on connaît les affinités avec le répertoire moderne, ces trois oeuvres bénéficient ici d'une interprétation superlative grâce aux instrumentistes virtuoses du London Sinfonietta. L'érudit texte de présentation est signé de Paul Crossley lui-même, dont le clavier atteste également d'une clairvoyante compréhension de l'univers messianesque. Voilà un superbe album, que l'on pourra comparer aux autres versions de référence gravées par Myung-Whun Chung (DG) et Pierre Boulez (Erato, Montaigne, Sony)."
5,"Enfin, après 3 ans d'attente le second album est sorti! Fan de la première heure depuis l'album ""A beautiful world"" , je suis heureuse de pouvoir à nouveau entendre la fabuleuse musique de Robin. On peut sentir tout l'ame qu'il a mis dans chacune de ces chansons, qui j'en suis sure vous toucheront vous aussi. C'est un artiste incroyablement talentueux. Quel dommage qu'il ne soit pas connu en France!"
5,"Dans la lignée de son premier album, Bill Fay nous livre avec ""Time of Last Persecution"" un album empreint à nouveau de poésie mélancolique, avec toutefois quelques titres plus enjoués. Avec des chansons comme ""Dust filled room"", ""Plan D"", et en apothéose ""I hear you calling"" (attention drogue dure), vous ne pourrez que succomber à ce deuxième opus."
4,"Belle affaire pour qui souhaite un substantiel aperçu de la musique de Jacques Ibert (1890-1962) ! Voilà ici réédités deux piliers de sa discographie, provenant du catalogue Emi. En 1973/75, Louis Fremaux faisait resplendir des partitions associées à l'esprit narquois et à l'écriture naïve du Groupe des Six : la trépidante ""Bacchanale"", le ""Louisville Concerto"".  Ecrit en 1930 pour illustrer ""Un Chapeau de paille d'Italie"" de Labiche, le grasseyant ""Divertissement"" est vigoureusement défendu par l'orchestre anglais qui y souligne un humour à froid. Nullement impressionniste : cette ""Symphonie marine"" dont les dernières mesures semblent pourtant s'inspirer (parodie ?) des ""Jeux de vagues"" debussystes... Déjà reparus dans la collection ""L'Esprit Français"", les enregistrements (1974) de Jean Martinon avec l'Orchestre de l'ORTF présentent des oeuvres moins légères, plus sérieuses : l'ample et solennelle ""Ouverture de Fête"", les poétiques ""Tropismes pour des amours imaginaires"". Ainsi que le triptyque méditerranéen des ""Escales"", où la baguette inspirée de Martinon (malgré un orchestre pas toujours agile) ne démérite pas face aux versions gravées par Paul Paray (Mercury), Charles Munch (RCA) et Leopold Stokowski (Emi). Ce double-album propose aussi le ""Concerto pour flûte"" défendu par Emmanuel Pahud, accompagné par David Zinman à la Tonhalle de Zurich (2002). Ainsi que les ""Quatre Chansons de Don Quichotte"" où s'illustre José van Dam. A titre documentaire, Emi aurait pu compléter le programme par les historiques extraits chantés par Feodor Chaliapine, dirigés par le compositeur lui-même. Mais ne chipotons pas : ces deux disques sont déjà bien remplis..."
4,"Clairement, Stratovarius revient en forme avec cet album très réussi dans l'ensemble et permettant d'oublier leur album éponyme (2005) de triste mémoire. Malgré tout, on n'est pas au niveau de la recherche mélodique d'un Infinite. Mais on découvre de nouveaux sons, de nouvelles mélodies accrocheuses comme seul le groupe sais en sortir, et une énergie qui fait plaisir à entendre. Le départ de Timo Tolkki semble donc avoir été une bonne chose pour un groupe en perte de vitesse (même si Elements part 1 et 2 étaient loin d'être aussi mauvais que le disent certains). On notera aussi l'arrivée d'un nouveau guitariste (Matias Kupiainen remplaçant Tolkki) plutôt très bon dans l'ensemble et donnant un nouveau souffle aux titres de l'album avec des solos parfois vraiment étonnants; un nouveau bassiste aussi fait son apparition en la personne de Lauri Porra. La voix de Kotipelto n'a pas changé d'un iota, et c'est tant mieux. L'ensemble est donc très réussi il faut bien le reconnaitre. Je pense personnellement qu'il manque à Stratovarius pour passer au stade supérieur l'utilisation d'instruments classiques à la place, ou du moins en renfort des nappes de claviers comme le font déjà pas mal de groupes comme Epica, Rhapsody, Dark Moor, Nightwish..."
5,"totalement different de the gift ( autre music romance)ce zorn n'en est pas moins excellent, plus proche de certains filmworks et avec la meme bande baron,cohen,patton,shaft etc...les artistes du label tzadik...un très très bon john zorn"
4,Comme promis Supercharger renoue avec le style que l'on aime tant chez Machine Head. Après un Burning Red Décevant voici un Supercharger exaltant. La force et la rythmique impeccable du quatuor est de retour. Ils nous signent là un album qui ne décoit pas.
5,"Mr Bungle est l'un des meilleurs groupe de la planete mais aussi l'un des plus etranges . Ce Discovolante (quel merveilleux titre) en est la preuve la plus indiscutable . Quand on a l'album dans les mains on remarque que la jaquette et le livret est tout simplement magnifique (le plus beau que j'ai jamais vu). On voit deja que le groupe a decidé de s'inspirer du mouvement surréaliste. Mais lorsqu'on ecoute l'album c'est encore autre chose : c'est une vraie expérience fantastique à vivre , il est tres special et ne plaira pas à tout le monde. Mais il faut ecouter cela au moins une fois dans sa vie pour se rendre compte qu'il existe autre chose en musique. Je ne revelerais rien de l'album car il faut l'ecouter pour y croire . Pour indication , apres ma premiere ecoute , j'ai eu du mal à trouver le sommeil. Je n'avais jamais ressenti ca en ecouter un disque . Maintenant c'est vous qui voyez si vous voulez vivre une expérience unique en musique ou si vous voulez juste vous divertir ."
4,"Après avoir écouté les différents extraits du skeud via youtube, je me faisait une joie de retrouver les frères cavalera à nouveau réunis comme au bon vieux temps!!!!! Après de nombreuses écoutes, on a affaire à un très bon cru, dans la continuité des excellents prophecy et dark ages de soulfly. Et c'est là qu'est ma petite déception: ça ressemble plus à un disque de soulfly featuring iggor aux fûts qu'à un réel retour à l'alchimie et aux sonorités du sepultura de la première époque: dommage!!! Cependant les ziks sont suffisamment pêchues et bien écrites pour faire headbanger n'importe quel fan de cavalera!!!Et c'est le principal!!!! Vivement les lives et le prochain soulfly!!!!"
2,Difficile d'écouter cet album. C'est une suite de sketches musicaux qui mélangent des recherches sonores et mélodies dissonnantes avec des dicussions philosophiques douteuses dans un anglais californien difficile à saisir. Pour inconditionnels seulement.
2,"Toujours difficile de faire un choix dans Zappa et bon; il faut bien avouer que vous pouvez vous passer de cet album, même si je l'écoute de temps en temps... en entier il est assez intenable... Truck Driver Divorce, sort un peu du lot... sinon si vous êtes fan des solo de Steve Vaï allez-y... (mais préférez quand même Apostrophe!)"
5,"Autant le dire de suite je n'apprécie pas trop le côté très commercial de Diam's, ce style de rap ""vendu"" qui m'exaspère. Pourtant avec cet album j'ai été agréablement surprise, même si on est pas au niveau de Keny Arkana ( vous aurez compris mes préférences ;) ), les paroles s'enchainent et s'écoutent bien, un peu américaines par moment ( Rien à foutre, Royality, Jal-uzi   ), elles m'ont plusieurs fois fait sourire ( une des meilleures intro que j'ai entendue ), mais ne sont pas dénuées d'intelligence, et certains messages passent très bien ( C'est toi qui m'gêne, Le fléau, Tu t'imagine ). Au niveau de la musique, elle n'est pas transcendante mais les instrus sont bonnes, et surtout, restes brutes. Associé à la voix chaude et rythmée de Diam's, le style atteint son point d'excellence dans Rimer ou ramer. Certains titres sont plus légers ( Eternel, Drôle de bizz, Premier mandat ), et peuvent déplaire, mais globalement je considère cet album comme le meilleur, et dans mon étagère il est fièrement rangé à côté de Freeman, de Keny Arkana et des Fugees, entre autres. En résumé, on est loin de La boulette et des Confessions nocturnes, et c'est tant mieux. Tout ça a dû commencer avec Dj, j'ai entendue dire que Diam's avait été surprise ( limite dégoutée ) que ce titre ait eu ce tel succès, dommage qu'elle soit tout de même partie dans cette voie... Dommage."
1,"Je dessine sur les nappes des restaurants, sur des bouts de papier (oui, je sais, j'ai une vie passionnante ^^), et mes neveux sont toujours éblouis par mes dessins. Je suis incapable de réussir les mains, suis nul pour la perspective, les visages sont approximatifs, mais tant que ce que je dessine ressemble, qu'on arrive à reconnaître, on me trouve doué. Grand Corps Malade, c'est un peu pareil. Le gars est sympathique, et en dîner de famille, je trouverais probablement ses textes formidables. Seulement, il n'est pas plus poète que je ne suis dessinateur.  Là où un Renaud manie un argot compréhensible par tous, réinvente la langue chantée, GCM est scotché à sa banlieue et n'en décolle jamais. C'est le petit phénomème de son quartier, plus doué que la moyenne, certes, assez pour éblouir ses petits copains, mais pas suffisamment pour enregistrer un disque, ni pour qu'on se déplace pour aller le voir sur scène. Sa poésie n'est pas celle de la rue, mais celle du trottoir, et voir combien on l'apprécie, c'est constater à quel point nous avons perdu le contact avec la poésie de Victor Hugo, Baudelaire et Rimbaud."
1,"Ce disque semble faire l'unanimité? Désolé, moi, je n'ai pas aimé le Slam! Les textes sont certes assez intéressants mais je préfère la musique, la vraie, celle avec des instruments tout autour, tout bêtement..."
5,"C'est le disque avec lequel j'ai découvert le groupe en 1989. Depuis mon approche de la musique n'a plus été la même...  De plus la langue allemende n'a jamais été aussi belle qu'ici; jetez une oreille sur ""Ein Stuhl In der Hölle"", c'est tout simplement magnifique. On est loin des horribles Rammstein... Tout est parfait dans cet album. Einstürzende Neubauten est un groupe fascinant à plus d'un titre."
2,"Et oui, je n'en reviens pas, Blind Guardian déçoit. Le groupe qui nous a habitué à des albums de haute volée (""Somewhere Far Beyond"", ""Imaginations From The Other Side"" ou ""Nightfall In Middle Earth"" pour n'en citer que quelques uns), nous livre un ""Twist in the Myth"" assez quelconque.   Je n'ai pas envie de me défouler sur Blind Guardian que je respecte énormément, et considère comme le groupe de speed metal le plus essentiel de son temps (aux côtés d'Helloween, bien entendu), mais il faut bien reconnaitre qu'à part les 2 premières chansons fort réussies, l'album passe sans que l'on ne s'arrête sur grand chose. On ne retient pas de morceaux forts; où sont passés les hymnes incroyables dont le groupe avait le secret? Ce disque n'est pas ridicule, il n'est même pas mauvais, il n'a juste pas beaucoup de saveur. C'est le premier CD du groupe que je n'achète pas, et cela fait tout drôle...  Pour ceux qui découvrent Blind Guardian, ne vous fiez pas à ce ""Twist"" peu représentatif de leur talent, et jetez-vous sur le reste de leur discographie à la qualité remarquable! De ""Tales From The Twilight World"" (3e album sorti en 1990) jusqu'à ""A Night at the Opera"" (2002), vous ne risquez rien..."
5,"Metallica récidive tout juste un an après Kill'em all avec un second album qui se devait d'atteindre la qualité du premier.  Réussite extraordinaire, évolution mélodique exemplaire. Metallica invente sur cet album tout ce qui fait sa spéficité et est peut-être le premier artiste au monde ayant réussi à allier avec succès la puissance et la violence de la musique avec la mélodie et l'émotion qu'elle peut dégager en même temps. Remercions Cliff Burton pour avoir su apporter tant de richesse à ce groupe de part son ouverture musicale et sa clairvoyance. Les four horsemen signent sur cet album trois de leurs meilleurs titres : Fade to Black, For whom the bell tolls, Creeping Death. Trois morceaux qui symbolisent à la perfection le groupe : la mélodie de fade to black, la lourdeur de For Whom the Bell Tolls, et le thrash de Creeping Death."
5,"Kill'em'all réunissait les compos de leurs demos de 81 et 82.Les morceaux avaient surtout été  écrits par Jamz et Lars. Changement de bassiste et de guitariste ... le 1er veritable album de Metallica en tant que groupe à part entière c'est ""Ride"" ! Quel album, quelle fraicheur (à l'époque bien sûr...) : l'intro trompeuse en a surpris plus d'un. Tous les morceaux sont bons, rien à jeter. Tous les membres sont crédités sur les compos ( et même les anciens membres...) la preuve que tout le monde s'est impliqué. For du succés de ""Kill'em"", Metallica part en tournée avec Venom en Europe (1ère venue en France) et leur volent la vedette. L'album qui m'a fait aimé le thrash US !"
5,"""Sabotage"" est le sixième album de Black Sabbath et succède au génial ""Sabbath Bloody Sabbath"", considéré par beaucoup comme l'album le plus abouti du groupe. Il est étonnant de voir à quel point ""Sabotage"" succède dignement à ""Sabbath Bloody Sabbath"". Sans doute parce que le groupe, après avoir (légèrement) adouci son style sur ""Sabbath Bloody Sabbath"", est revenu à un son plus proche du Heavy Metal.  L'album démarre en fanfare avec ""Hole In The Sky"", une véritable démonstration dans le genre (écoutez le riff).  ""Don't Start (Too Late)"" est un de ces courts interludes acoustiques auxquels Tony Iommi nous a habitués depuis ""Master Of Reality"". Le riff de ""Symptom Of The Universe"" tue (ah, la section rythmique !) et rappelle à tous ceux qui en douteraient encore que Black Sabbath est le premier vrai groupe de Heavy Metal (la conclusion de ce morceau est plutôt décalée).  ""Megalomania"" commence comme une belle balade planante et mélancolique aux effets de guitare ""slide"" et aux arrangements délicats avant d'enchaîner sur une seconde partie au rythme endiablé et au riff en acier trempé (le meilleur titre de l'album ! Et du groupe ?).  Sur ""Thrill Of It All"", Tony Iommi nous assène encore une fois un excellent riff en béton qu'Ozzy Osbourne accompagne à la perfection avant un enchaînement surprenant qui donne au titre toute son originalité.  Avec ses choeurs, l'instrumental ""Supertzar"" a été conçu comme une ouverture d'opéra majestueuse.  ""Am I Going Insane (Radio)"" est un rock hypnotique  aux refrains plutôt ""pop"" (les ricanements finaux trouvent leur explication dans le titre).  ""Sabotage"" se conclut sur ""The Writ"", un rock puissant et lent, à la fois rageur et désespéré.  Certains disent de ""Sabotage"" qu'il s'agit du meilleur album du groupe. Il est en effet plus abouti que ""Paranoid"" et moins sophistiqué que ""Sabbath Bloody Sabbath"". Mais les trois albums sont fabuleux de toute façon et les départager me semble difficile. Au final, ""Sabotage"", comme les deux autres, est un disque qu'il faut se procurer sans attendre !"
5,"On peut dire que la carrière d'Yngwie se divise en plusieurs époques. Des deux premiers albums principalement instrumentaux (marching out) en passant par les albums nettement plus ""commerciaux"" (odyssey, eclipse) et de nos jours aux albums ""baroque and roll"", YJM nous a montré toutes les cordes qu'il a sa guitare. Trilogy est un album à part. D'une part parce qu'il se situe entre deux époques fort différentes (époque instrumentale et époque commerciale) et que de nombreux fans considèrent cet album comme le plus proche de l'intégrité artistique du virtuose suèdois. On peut en cela dire que Trilogy demeure ""l'église"" des malmsteeniens, initiateur avant l'heure de ""7th sign"" et de ""Magnum Opus"". A posséder absolument, donc, pour tout fan digne de ce nom."
5,"C'est un excellent album, qui a juste eu le tort de sortir alors que la popularité d'Yngwie tombait définitivement dans l'oubli quasi-général. Hormis deux titres plus faibles (""Meant To Be"" et la sirupeuse ballade ""Prisoner Of Your Love""), il n'y a que des morceaux de premier ordre sur cet opus, certains devenant des classiques en concert (""Never Die"", ""Seventh Sign""), signe de réussite artistique. La production est également excellente et les performances des musiciens agréables, dont celle de Michael Vescera qui est un chanteur de premier ordre. En plus des douze morcaux, il y a un inédit qui, s'il n'a pas la possibilité d'être un classique, à la mérite d'être sympathique et d'être un instrumental réussi. Au final, ""Seventh Sign"" fera toujours parti de mon top 5 du guitariste."
1,"Ah... Manowar, tout ou presque a été dit sur ce groupe. Les auto proclamés Kings Of Metal, adulés par certains pour leur côté true metal et détestés par (beaucoup) d'autres pour leur côté... ridicule. Enfin, quoi qu'on en pense, Manowar ne laisse pas indifférent et a sa place dans l'histoire du metal. Et puis, si on excepte les paroles à la `warrior of steel and fire of blood', musicalement, c'est loin d'être si ridicule. Le groupe a tout de même sorti quelques classiques tels que Hail To England, Kings Of Metal ou Triumph Of Steel et puis Louder Than Hell était quand même excellent. Mais c'était avant Warriors Of The World, le dernier album du groupe sorti il y a déjà 6 ans. Gods Of War est encore plus mauvais... L'album commence par une intro interminable et si pompeuse qu'on la croirait tirée d'un morceau de Rhapsody (mais on va y revenir). C'est long, 6 minutes... Surtout que le second titre est aussi une intro, narrative cette fois, avec en guest le (de moins en moins) grand Christopher Lee. En fait, on va quand même attendre plus de 8 minutes avant que l'album ne débute vraiment. Et ce ""King Of Kings"", plutôt pas mal, mais qu'on connaissait donc déjà puisque sorti il y a quelques temps déjà. Evoquons tout de même le phénomène qui a poussé Manowar à sortir 5 produits (dont 3 DVD) depuis le dernier album et prendre ses fans pour des vaches à lait tout en tentant de cacher la misère. Mais revenons sur le disque avec un petit interlude inutile puis ""Sleipnir"" et sa petite intro avec ce cher Christopher Lee, toujours aussi saoulant. Un bon morceau cependant, dans la pure tradition du combo. En fait, les quelques vrais morceaux sont plutôt bons mais enfouis sous trop d'immondices. Après ""Loki God Of Fire"", qui malgré son absence d'introduction, semble vraiment anecdotique, arrive ""Blood Brothers"", une belle ballade, mélodique, qui permet de profiter enfin des capacités vocales d'Eric Adams, qui est quand même un des plus grands chanteurs de l'histoire du heavy metal. Histoire de tout gâcher, Manowar nous balance un nouvel interlude symphonique de près de 4 minutes sur lequel il ne se passe rien (sauf la fin qui ressemble à ""The Crown And The Ring"") qui enchaîne sur un autre acte narratif (insupportable) de 4 minutes. Ah oui au fait, Gods of War est un album conceptuel qui traite de la mythologie nordique. C'est sûrement super intéressant (non, en fait, même pas...) mais à écouter, c'est vraiment écoeurant. Et tout l'album est ainsi, les quelques bons morceaux étant noyés sous une masse indigeste de narrations et d'interludes insipides. En fait, il n'y a que 8 vrais titres sur 15 sur Gods Of War, dont seuls trois ou quatre sont dignes du groupe. Quant au bonus ""Die For Metal"" (qui est aussi un single!?!) et dont le riff principal plagie ""Kashmir"", il révèle un manque d'inspiration évident et inquiétant.  Choeurs pompeux, intermèdes symphoniques interminables, en lorgnant sur Rhapsody (""Hymn Of The Immortal Warrior"" et ""Gods Of War"" en premier lieu), Manowar a sorti, après 6 ans d'attente, son pire album. Pire encore que Warriors Of The World, qu'on avait presque réussi à pardonner en pensant qu'il ne s'agissait que d'un égarement. Il n'en est rien. La question qui se pose est comment le groupe va encore pouvoir se targuer d'être le groupe le plus heavy de l'univers avec deux albums (en 10 ans) aussi minables. Et quand on sait que cet album est le premier volet d'une trilogie, on peut vraiment craindre le pire sur l'avenir du groupe. Un groupe dont l'imagerie true metal a tant représenté et qui sombre de manière incompréhensible dans un `style' qui risque de le perdre à jamais. Au fait, en réponse à une déclaration de ce bon (vieux) Joey DiMaio, principal investigateur de ce fiasco, Wagner n'est pas l'inventeur du heavy metal, sa musique était d'ailleurs beaucoup plus... intense."
2,Le pire de Manowar ! Juste 3 morceaux de valable sur tout l'album et le reste n'est que de la ... Domage au vu des précédent album et de l'image que véhicule le groupe. Bientôt la chute ? Je ne leur souhaite pas mais en attendant je garde mes Euros pour acheter d'autres albums plus convaincant.
5,"Une des plus belles versions des sonates de Beethoven, précise mais jamais glaciale, formidablement simple et musicale, du grand art."
5,"cet album de swans est clairement le plus abouti. les  accords de guitares sont  aériens, les percussions soutenues et puissantes. la voie de michael gira est vraimment génial, et les air sublimes.."
5,"Encore un groupe talentueux superbement et injustement ignoré par la critique (et le public). Ce trio anglais mené par Luke Haines (leader de The Auteurs - cf. le classique   de 1993 -) accouche d'une petite merveille de pop raffinée aux charmantes mélodies. Plusieurs écoutes minutieuses sont indispensables pour bien apprécier les infinies subtilités que recèle ce disque. Atmosphère délicieusement vaporeuse (nappes de synthétiseurs, caractère évanescent des voix), rythmes alanguis, la dominante onirique transparaît aussi dans le parti pris instrumental adopté par le trio : emploi fréquent du glockenspiel et du xylophone, pratique constante de la réverbération, prédilection pour les sons planants. C'est parce qu'il s'adresse avant tout à nos sens que l'album évite l'écueil habituel du formalisme pop (froideur, artificialité)."
2,"La BOF ne comporte pas toutes les musiques du film, notamment pas celles de la première ni de la dernière danse : un comble ! Bien sûr, on retrouve qqs unes des chansons qu'on aime bien, notamment les 2 très bons titres de Missy Elliot, mais c'est une déception dans l'ensemble, quand même."
1,"Quelle tristesse! Comment supporter ces interminables lamentations!? Voilà un disque d'une platitude inconcevable, c'est le désert des Tartares! Vraiment album parmi les plus glauques...si c'est cela le lyrisme..."
5,"Les critiques visent toujours les meilleurs , et la vérité c'est que Madonna est une artiste internationale de divertissement et dans ce rang elle est au top , sur cette album elle se régale sur les production de Timberland , The Neptunes et autres et montre sa polyvalence quelquesoit les styles et les époques , moi qui écoute plutôt du rap , j'ai toujours respecté Madonna et aujourd'hui encore plus , mon morceau préféré "" beat goes on "" et puis le tube "" give it to me "" ... les commentaires négatifs sur cette artivle viennent de personnes qui n'ont pas compris qu'ils sont une minorité sur terre , et que la musique pour la plupart des gens est un loisir , un plaisir pas forcement une passion ... Très bon album !!!!! Achetez le"
5,"Après le succès de son premier album solo ""Northern star"" et l'échec commercial cuisant de ""reason"", l'ex-spice girl revient avec un troisième album. Melanie C est coauteur de 11 de ces 12 nouvelles chanson, elle a également produit ce disque grâce à sa propre maison de disque, aucun major ne souhaitant renouveller son contrat. Elle aurait pu se ruiner mais a finalement réussi l'exploit de faire un bon album à succès (pas encore très entendu en France...) Son single ""first day of my life"" est une vraie réussite. A conseiller également les titres: ""better alone"" et ""next best superstar"""
2,"ça sonne parfois dans les choeurs comme Michael J qui, d'ailleurs, le citait dans le journal Ebony. Mais on s'ennuye vraiment tant tout cela manque d'âme et les mélodies assez pauvres. Cela montre bien que tout le monde ne peut pas sonner R'nB ou Funk comme ça... 2 étoiles car au moins certains tentent ce créneau de la composition sans sampler les autres."
1,Un jolie mélange ou les chansons rythmer ce croise avec des balades a pleurer. Ce petit latin lover risque de faire craquer la france entiere.
4,"Un album de plus pour Mr. R&amp;B qui reste fidèle à Elektra Records. Album très réussi et très varié d'ailleurs. Beaucoup de fans reprochent à Keith de ne plus être au summum comme auparavant, mais personne ne pourra nier que ses albums sont toujours très largement au dessus de la moyenne de ce qui a été édité la même année. Keith nous publie une oeuvre plutôt diversifiée par rapport à ces précédents travaux. Trois morceaux à la mode par rapport au contexte du moment. Ils sont moins bons que les autres pistes de l'album mais demeurent quand même sympathiques du fait qu'il y ait des invités de renom : « He say she say » avec T-Boz de TLC, « Things » avec deux membres du Flipmode Squad, à savoir Rah Digga et Busta Rhymes, et « I put U on », une production Rodney Jerkins. A part ces trois titres moins réussis que les autres, l'opus de Keith est un quasi sans faute. Il est essentiellement constitué de ballades purement R&amp;B, non pas avec des mélodies à l'eau de rose, mais des mélodies arrangées « classic R&amp;B ». Parmi ces morceaux on retrouve « Don't have me » avec le grand Dave Hollister pour un duo explosif et une démonstration parfaite sur l'art de chanter et de faire des chaeurs « dynamiques ». On retrouve également « Only wanna please you », « Games » avec son instru sur un fond de guitare très mélodieux, et bien sûr « I'll trade (a million bucks) », le tube phare en duo avec Lil' Mo où le vétéran de la Newjack nous montre une fois de plus qu'il sait très bien maximiser le talent des femmes avec lesquelles il collabore pour un duo mixte en conformité avec les espérances des fans. Le remix de « I'll trade » est également agréable à l'écoute. Le piano a été moins mis en valeur pour mettre plus en évidence le talkbox et les portions de guitare, ce qui donne un charme différent au titre. Si on veut trouver une chanson où la manière de chanter de l'artiste ressemble plus à celle des albums précédents, c'est vers les excellents mid tempos « Whatcha like » et « Real men » qu'il faut se diriger. Il est d'ailleurs accompagné par une charmante demoiselle dans ces deux titres. Sans sombrer dans la banalité, Keith nous offre un bon album qui concorde parfaitement avec l'air du temps. Je l'ai vraiment adoré et je le conseille à tout le monde."
1,"Avec un titre pareil, la midinette Britney va tout faire exploser ! Non contente de s'être laissée offrir un troublant ""french kiss"" par la Madonne elle même (qui en rêvait depuis longtemps à en juger par les t-shirts ""Britney"" qu'elle arbore depuis ""Music"")lors d'une ""Award"" ceremony dont les américains ont le secret, la voilà qui enregistre tout naturellement un duo avec cette scandaleuse et naturelle maitresse : les deux ont beaucoup à y gagner ... abandonner son image d'adolescente-bubblegum et s'encanailler pour l'une, retrouver le chemin des charts et du public jeune pour l'autre. Une opération Marketing remarquable. A noter sur la pochette que ses vêtements ont l'air de la gêner de plus en plus : vivement le prochain single, donc !"
1,"J'ai pas écouté ""ça"", encore moins je ne l'ai acheté... donc qu'est ce que je viens faire là ? Ben juste dire à ""benjaminlabarthepiol"" qu'on n'a pas le droit de mettre dans le même paragraphe Rage Against The Machine et ça là. Comme on n'a pas le droit de comparer mozart à andré rieu, ou encore l'autre blaireau qui avait gagné la nouvelle ya 2 ou 3 ans à kurt cobain comme ça avait été fait. La liberté c'est bien, mais faut pas en faire n'importe quoi, quand même. Merci."
1,"heureusement que j'ai hésité avant de l'acheter, après uneécoute avec mon meilleur ami, la messe était dîte lol : c'est un album banale ou chacun des musiciens essaient d'être bons, mais il n'y arrive à aucun moment dommage pr eux"
1,"Jennifer Lopez ne nous offre rien de très intéressant, rien de nouveau. Que du réchauffé, et à travers ses chansons elle nous prouve encore une fois qu'elle ne sait pas chanté, et que sa voix est vraiment horrible...De plus elle a encore fait ce qu'elle sait faire le mieux : voler la musique d'autres artistes. Après avoir volé des chansons à Mariah Carey en 2001, elle a cette fois volé la chanson ""Ride"" d'Usher pour en faire son single ""Get right"" et elle a également volé une chanson de Brandy pour en faire sa chanson ""Ryde or Die"". C'est vraiment pathétique. Je vous le déconseille donc vivement et je vous conseille plutôt justement les CD de Mariah Carey, qui elle, au moins sait chanter, a une voix magnifique et sait faire de la musique plutôt que de la voler..."
2,"Je suis tombé sous l'emprise de l'artiste il y a une dizaine d'années, dès son premier album «Plantation lullabies». Hallucinante musicienne, certainement la plus talentueuse et la plus douée de la scène black'n soul actuelle, j'avoue être très franchement déçu par ce dernier opus. Où sont passés la créativité et l'éclectisme qui la caractérisaient? On reprend vaguement un «Call me» des débuts, on assaisonne d'un peu de raggae nouvelle cuisine et le tour est joué... Certes, la basse est là et frappe toujours aussi fort. Mais tout ceci me laisse un petit goût de revenez-y, surtout après l'énôôôrme et fabuleux «Cookie» précédent... Vivement son prochain projet, qui s'annonce d'ores et déjà très prometteur. On y attend notamment Cassandra Wilson, Kenny Garrett ou encore Joshua Redman. J'en salive d'avance..."
2,"Voilà, donc, l'album pour lequel (mystère) les gens s'emballent. Curieux, pour un album hautement surestimé. L'ensemble est désuet et un peu niais.Les textes n'évitent pas la facilité et musicalement c'est charmant mais sans relief."
2,"Le titre principal ""La femme chocolat"" est intéressant, contrairement aux autres.  En effet, se dégage du disque un rythme hispanique sans aucun rapport avec le tempo du titre phare. Il faut donc aimer ce genre de musique. Globalement, je m'attendais à mieux après avoir écouté des extraits. Bref, un produit que je ne recommanderai pas. Je suggère que le site diffuse des extraits de plusieurs morceaux, afin que l'acheteur soit mieux informé."
2,"Si ce disque sortait ""anonyme"" sans tout le battage médiatique comme malheureusement des centaines de vrais auteurs méconnus mais autrement talentueux, il serait noyé dans la masse. De plus une ""chanteuse"" qui annonce par avance qu'elle ne va pas chanter.... C'est juste un ""hobby"" d'une riche et belle femme, certainement intelligente et ayant plein d'amis talentueux... Il vaut mieux écouter ceux qui n'ont que leur passion pour bouffer!"
2,"bon cd à l'epoque mais il est vite devenu le contraire de ce qui chanter....pour moi c mec vaut rien et merite q'on lui crache dessus...si les gens qui ont acheté ces cd a l'epoque auraient su comment il a viré maintenant,y serait à la rue le pti doc sarkoziste.....nul"
5,"Michael Bublé a la voix parfaite pour ces chansons! Un timbre très sensuel et à la fois doux et lisse, il vous transporte dans de purs moments de détentes en reprenant ces quelques chansons à sa manière. Superbe reprise de ""The way you look tonight"" à sa sauce."
5,"Cet album de Nas est a classe dans les historiques, un flow incomparable qui a influence pleins de rappeurs...achetez tout simplement"
5,"Paramore rocks, écoutez juste Hallelujah ou Let The Flames Begins et vous aurez compris le new alternatif. Misery Business est aussi présent sur Guitar Hero World Tour ! Ca change du rock style green day ou phoenix d'où le nom RIOT !"
1,"Ya bien les idées, le matériel, le look, mais rien à faire cet album ne décolle pas, et reste après ces années de recul d'une platitude déconcertante. Et en plus ils ne reprennent pas BREAKOUT (du premier album), seul morceau digne de ce nom écrit par ces garçons. Totalement inutile."
2,"Outre les véritables qualités artistiques de la diva et si votre système hi-fi est un minimum décent, oubliez ce disque ! Une overdose de graves (même pas du vrai grave, du bas-médium pour flatter les mini chaînes ...) au mixage et à la production étouffe les qualités vocales de Alicia et trame une agressivité sonore intolérable au bout de 5 minutes ! Achetez sans hésitations ses 2 premiers albums, oubliez celui-ci à peine meilleur qu'un bootleg. D'ailleurs, je propose mon exemplaire à la vente ... Un amateur ? ..."
2,"Helas loin d'atteindre les qualités des prochains opus, les chansons sont sympas mais vraiment sans plus, a part l'excellent No No No part2 avec Wyclef Jean des Fugees . A posseder si vous etes fan comme moi des Destiny's Child, sinon passez votre chemin, les prochains albums sont plus interessant ."
5,"Réellement un excellent album, varié (rap, r'n'b, gospel...) et qui est d'ailleurs ,pour moi, de loin leur meilleur album. honnetement, si vous aimez bien ce genre de zic, il faut foncer l'acheter!"
5,"Une osmose entre Charlotte Gainsbourg et AIR s'opère sur ce CD.  Je la redécouvre. C'est un album pour se détendre et apprécier.  Pour les amateurs, cet album me fait penser à celui de son père ""Mélody Nelson"". En tout cas,[...]vous ne serez pas déçu !!!"
1,"Il ya quelques mois Depeche Mode lançait l'opération ""Depeche Mode Digital Street team"" (dont je fais partie) une vaste campagne de diffusion sur tous les supports (dont FB, amazon, Myspace, etc...) de ""toute la beauté"" de leur dernier album, ceci afin de réviser à la hausse les notes moyennes et les commentaires déposés sur l'ensemble des bases de données et sites en ligne amenés à présenter leur dernier Opus. Je constate que ce ""marketing viral"" est un succés complet, je n'ai jamais entendu autant de louanges pour un album aussi insipide. Fan de toujours, et n'ayant jamais raté une seule tournée depuis 88, je suis hyper déçu par cet album pourtant tant attendu, surtout aprés le brillantissime ""Playing the Angel"" et la fabuleuse tournée qui s'en est suivie. Rien. Pas de mélodies (je ne parle pas que de ""mélodies accrocheuses"" pour en faire de bons singles, moi j'ai toujours aimé tous les styles de DM, du plus vif au plus lent), c'est à dire que l'on perd complètement la ""ligne"" des thèmes comme si Martin ou Dave eux mêmes les avaient perdu à trop jouer au baby (voir vidéos du coffret Deluxe). Refrain mous, voire franchement naïfs (Peace...), paroles puisées dans d'anciens textes (I'll be waiting patiently...), mots répétés inlassablement (Wrong...) comme un exercice... Ou est la poésie. Au final il nous semble que l'album de démos, c'est celui-là, et qu'il a manqué PAS MAL d'approfondissement au fond et la forme qui jusqu'ici laisse un arrière gout d'ensemebles de mauvaises Face B. ""Corrupt"" sort un peu plus du lot (hélas ...la dernière !) mais sans non plus briller comme on aurait tant voulu espérer !!! Le coffret Deluxe n'est pas justifié (pièces inintéressantes quoique trés bien présentées, mais c'est l'apanage des as en Design de packaging, ça), encore moins le titre de l'album qui semblait faire échoàu ""Music For The Masses"" de 87. Rien n'est moins vrai, ces sons n'ont rien d'universels... En gros, je suis vraiment écoeuré, mais je ne pense pas qu'il sera facile de trouver des commentaires réelellement objectifs, pour les raisons précedemment citées. Admettons que l'album est raté, et faisons tout de même confiance aux Mode pour savoir une fois de plus et comme toujours, rebondir sur une nouvelle pépite d'ici 4 ans..."
1,"J'ai écouté l'album en avant première sur le site des fans belges de dépèche mode. Quelle mauvaise surprise! Utilisation de synthés au son très vintage années 80,voix de dave Gahan absolument pas mise en valeur. Un retour dans le passé, tout le contraire que ce que dépèche mode avait fait auparavant. Bref,mieux vaut écouter avant d'acheter!"
4,Seul et unique album d'un des meileurs combos de fusion US.Une grande claque et une detestable sensation d'inachevé. Un album kollector...
5,"Ce coffret DVD sorti juste après l'époque Black album illustre a merveille le potentiel de Metallica en concert!Du début jusqu'à la fin, ils donnent tout ce qu'ils ont dans les tripes en interprétant des must comme One, Master of Puppets ou Seek &amp; Destroy.Je vous le dis a tous: ce coffret est ABSOLUMENT a avoir pour tout fan de Metallica qui se respecte. Même si vous hésitez, jettez-vous a corps perdu dans cette achat en vous disant que sinon vous le regretterez peut-être un jour.Longue vie à Metallica et a tous leurs fans!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"Contrairement à quelques autres groupes de Rock, ACDC a toujours réussi à traverser les époques en restant fidèle à ce son si mythique! Cet album est vraiment grandiose et ACDC est bien de retour ! La plupart des morceaux me donnent la chair de poule, plutôt rare ces derniers temps... P... que c'est bon !!!! Le Rock a de belles années devant lui, merci Angus, tu es comme un bon vin qui se bonifie au fil des années ! Vivement un concert..."
1,"Retenons nous en effet... d'acheter ce pitoyable produit de marketing parfaitement calibré pour faire un maximum de bénéfices ! Risible est ce groupe, indigente est leur ""musique"" ! A ranger entre Britney Spears et autres ^""Star academy""."
1,"je ne pense pas qu'il existe de mauvais albums contrairement à certains,tout dépend de quel point de vue on se place(celui de l'adolescent,ou celui de l'artiste expérimenté). Le plus objectivement possible,on ne peut pas dire que cet album soit une perle,d'ailleurs comment serait-ce possible quand il a été enregistré en si peu de temps? Ensuite quand je vois certains dire que ça change de Goldman,ou d'autres grands de la chanson française!!!Mon dieu! Comment peuvent-ils oser?Ces gens-là ont-ils oublier les 2Be3?non ça ne change de rien du tout,c'est toujours pareil.Toujours la même musique,et ceux qui ne sont pas d'accord n'ont qu'à s'acheter d'anciens cd des 2be3 ou des spice girls,et ils verront si ça change... Mais que peut-on faire?ça fait de l'argent et c'est comme ça.Les jeunes ne voudront pas comprendre parce que c'est leur style de musique. Sachez tout de meme,s'il y en a qui me lisent,que je suis aussi jeune(18 ans quand meme),que j'ai déjà écouté cette sorte de musique,et je pense que la vraie musique,celle qui vous plait ne peut pas etre celle là,parce qu'elle est trop impersonnelle,on ne ressent pas grand chose avec. Le mieux c'est de trouver des styles plus précis, le reggae ,la techno,le metal,tout ce que vous voulez tant que ça vous fait frissonner de plaisir! Oui moi je frissonne de plaisir quand j'écoute mes solos de metal,vous vous frissonnerez de plaisir pour d'autres styles de musique, mais vous ne frissonnerez jamais pour popstars je vous le dis."
1,Faut-il que la musique soit tombée bien-bas pour en arriver là ! Quand la jeunesse est manipulée par les médias...à éviter absolument !!!
1,"Et voilà encore de la musique de bulles dans nos backs ! C'est incroyable ! on va finir par croire que le public a oublié qu'une musique était faite d'une voix (désolé les filles, mais ça, ça vous manque cruellement !), une composition (la musique, l'air, les trucs qui font que la musique est belle ; ici, quand on a le malheur d'écouter la chanson le matin, on retient l'air toute la journée, et on découvre à quel point elle est nase. Désolé, les gars !), et des paroles (là, je préfère ne rien dire, c'est l'association de quelques mots en vrac. Tout est plat, plat, plat et plat... les auteurs ont sans doute oublié que le public pouvait aussi faire attention aux mots...). En bref, un disque fait de vide et de rien du tout. L'émission de télé les a boostées ? Tant mieux,mais une fois arrivées au top, les L5 ont encore beaucoup trop à prouver..."
1,"Johnny ! adulé par tant de personnes, m'interroge véritablement. Pourquoi 2 cd quand un seul suffisait amplement...Un besoin d'argent urgent peut être, facile à extirper de fans et donc d'inconditionnels !!! Les textes sont d'une richesse incroyable, au point de me demander si mon cd n'était pas rayé.... ""je veux te garder, apprendre à t'aimer, d'amour..."""
1,"Mais qu'arrive-t-il à Rammstein ? Il m'avait certes fallu plusieurs écoutes pour totalement adhérer au précédent, mais là, l'audition répétée de ce ""disque"" me plonge dans un ennui indescriptible, j'en ressors hébété, et très inquiet quant à la suite, car il suffit de lire les interviews du groupe pour comprendre que cet album est le cadet de leurs soucis... Les trois-quatre titres rentre-dedans sont pas mal, mais indignes de leurs illustres prédécesseurs, Rammstein se contentant de répéter une formule qui nous a explosé les esgourdes, mais visiblement sans se casser le c.. pour nous pondre de nouveaux  classiques... Le reste n'est que remplissage vaudevillesque qui dérangerait à peine l'auditrice hystérique de Frank Michael ! Y'a le feuer dans la baraque, et ça sent pas bon ! Moi, j'retourne écouter Mutter et revoir Live aus Berlin, en priant pour que ce groupe incroyable se réveille..."
2,"J ai bien ecouté l'album plusieurs fois et je suis vraiment decu. je trouve ce cd trés moyen. pour moi il ya 3-4 chansons qui sont plutot pas mal, mai le reste je n adhere vraiment pas. mes preférés: benzin ,spring ,feuer und wasser.  Wo bist du aurait pu etre un tres bon morceau mais malheureusement les paroles sont vraiment ridicules, limites risibles.pour le reste je trouve que dans l ensemble le son des guitares est tro etouffé, pas assez strident, et la voix de till est certes belles sur stirbt nicht vor mir, mais je n' accroche pas a cette chanson a la bon jovi. le morceau qui conclu cet album n'est vraiment pas a la hauteur d'un nebel.. pour moi il s'agit du plus mauvais ou diront nous du moins bon rammstein."
4,Enfin le concert complet avec le retour de Gary au chant qui s'en tire plutôt pas mal en remplacement de Graham Bonnet. Un live qui est en plus brut de décoffrage avec une rhytmique lourde et toujours le beau jeu de Michael tout en technique et finesse.
2,"J'aime beaucoup Céline et aussi Fabrice Lucchini dont je possède déjà plusieurs interprétations sur CD (Fables de la Fontaine ....). J'ai assisté à l'interprétation de l'extrait du ""Voyage au bout de la Nuit"" interprété dans le CD que je viens d'acheter il y a quelques années à Tourcoing - J'ai été conquis par la maîtrise et la passion de Lucchini. Par contre, dans le CD les différences de niveau de voix de F. Lucchini (d'un ton confidentiel à un ton passionné) gâchent complètement l'écoute de ce chef d'oeuvre. Parfois on entend quasi rien (phase confidentielle), parfois on est assourdi (phase passionnée) ; En résumé, un espoir de plaisir gâché par un enregistrement mal réalisé."
5,"En apprenant la sortie imminente de cet album, je me suis dit : mouais... encore une compilation des Fab Four. J'ai changé mon fusil d'épaule : - d'abord le son : whaouh! Comme dans le cas du remix du dessin animé le son est pro-di-gieux! Les albums originaux qui avaient fait l'objet d'un lifting dans les années 80 pour la sortie en CD ont pris un bon coup de vieux - le mixage de plusieurs chansons (ex Strawberry Fields forever) peux paraitre hasardeux, certes! On se rappelle le mixage très limite de la série des Antology (ex : la première prise avec des choeurs de la version finale) Mais d'un autre côté, il faut se rappleler que dans les années 60, jusqu'en 1968, les fab four devaient travailler avec un 4 pistes. Avec la technologie actuelle, on peut penser que le résultat de ce disque se rapproche de ce qu'il ne souhaitent réaliser alors (je me rappelle par exemple le souhait de John Lennon de mixer ""Tomorrow never knows"" avec un choeur de moines tibétains. Ensuite, les mixages sont pour certains vraiment opportuns : par exemple les deux morceaux qui n'ont qu'un seul accord (Tomorrow never knows et ""within you without you"") fonctionnent à merceille quand ils sont mélangés. - Enfin je trouve que cette compile ouvre une grand porte, celle de bénéficier à l'avenir d'un mixage en 5.1 pour tous les albums originaux."
2,"En 2006, le résultat consolidé d'EMI (maison de disques historique des Beatles et donc distributeur de « Love ») est en baisse de 10 % par rapport à 2005. Alors pour limiter la casse en fin d'année et pour que les actionnaires entament 2007 sur de bonnes bases, on sort un « nouveau » disque des Beatles. Lesquels roulent désormais sur les traces de Hendrix pour le nombre de disques et compilations posthumes parus. Ce coup-ci, Sir George Martin et son fils ont remixé, coupé, collé, mélangé et passé à la moulinette Pro-Tools un gros paquet de titres (tous ne sont pas cités dans le tracklisting) des Fab Four. Le divorce de McCartney lui coûte t-il plus cher que prévu ? Yoko Ono a-t-elle envie de diversifier ses placements ? Pourquoi ont-ils autorisé cette chose sans intérêt ? La magie des morceaux originaux permet certes dobtenir un résultat écoutable mais sans aucun but, sinon se faire un gros paquet d'euros. Dans le livret, le fiston de George Martin déclare qu'il avait l'impression au début des séances de peindre des moustaches sur le tableau de La Joconde. Heu ... non garçon, tu étais juste en train de charcuter des chansons des Beatles. Non pas que les morceaux des Beatles soient intouchables. Joe Cocker (« With a little help from my friends »), Grandaddy (""Revolution"") sont de bons exemples que l'on peut faire mieux que les originaux. Mais sur « Love » les retouches (quelquefois minimes) ne relèvent pas le niveau de départ, loin de là. Pour le prochain Noël, filez les bandes master à Rick Rubin ou Trent Reznor, au moins le résultat final aura des chances d'être intéressant. Ce qui n'est pas le cas ici."
5,"Pour prolonger le plaisir du plus grand film de l'histoire du cinéma, écoutez la plus formidable des B.O, inégalée à ce jour, de par son exceptionnelle intégration aux séquences du film, qui nous reviennent en mémoire lors de l'écoute. La perfection des instrumentations avec les mélodies à jamais gravées dans la mémoire, la chanson de Céline Dion, choix judicieux pour l'interpréter, font de ce CD un indispensable !"
4,"Je vois déjà certains faire la fine bouche, penser que 'Chaos ...' était meilleur. OK ! OK ! D'autres écriront même que c'est de la daube, que d'autres dinosaures font mieux. Alors là je dis Stop ! Laissez-nous apprécier notre Paulo préféré quand il nous joue du Macca ! Peu nous importe que cette production soit hors du temps, manque d'esprit rock and roll (?). C'est bien du Macca et ça nous ravit, avec quelques bijoux comme les très Wings 'Only Mother Knows' et 'Mr Bellamy' (ça ne vous rappelle pas 'London Town' ?), l'envoûtant 'House of Wax' et le hit 'Dance Tonight' (qui se réfère au 'I've Got a Feeling' de 'Let it Be' ?). Merci, Paul, pour cet opus charmant que je classe dans ton Top 10, sans hésiter."
1,"Un bon disque mais certainement pas un chef-d'oeuvre... Comparé hativement aux Stooges, au Velvet Underground ou à Television, ce groupe n'en a certainement pas la hargne et l'inventivité. Si vous cherchez un successeur aux Stooges, allez plutot voir du coté de ""At the Drive-In"". NB: The Strokes valent plus que la misérable étoile que je leur ai donné, mais c'était pour faire baisser leur moyenne trop élevée ;)"
5,"Je l'ai acheté sur un coup de tête lors de sa sortie. Calé sur la platine du magasin de disques, il a immédiatement retenu mon attention et depuis c'est moi qui ne le lâche plus. C'est un des cd que j'ai le plus écouté (je suis quand même passé à d'autres choses depuis !) et je m'inscris dans ce qui a été dit auparavant. Je rajouterais que cet album bénéficie d'une production et d'une qualité sonore ENORMISSIMES qui servent toutes les ambiances qu'il recèle sur un plateau d'argent. Variété et impression d'homogénéité sur tout l'album (fait suffisamment rare pour le signaler), équilibres entre les morceaux, peu (rien ?!) de choses à jeter. Buy and listen to the music ..."
1,"Très bon cd, groupe fantastique, mais cependant j'ai reçu le cd nom emballé, c'est à dire, pas de scellé en plastique au dessus du boîtier, de plus il était fortement âbimé, le cd n'a rien mais je suis surpris de la part d'amazon. Comme il n'était pas scellé ça amène à penser que le cd n'était pas neuf, étrange."
4,"Les Zutons de Liverpool déboulaient en 2004 avec cet ovni sonore extrêmement séduisant et entraînant et surtout imaginatif, où rock, folk, pop, psyché, jazz et ska et même titres à rallonge presque (j'ai dit: presque!) prog, se mêlent ou se mélangent dans un joyeux - parfois mélancolique - patchwork sonore qui réussit à être tout de même étonnamment homogène et cohérent. Viennent à l'esprit The Coral (en plus direct), Madness (en plus rock), Electric Soft Parade (en plus dépouillé) ou encore Supergrass (en plus bizzaroïde), mais sans la moindre impression de copiage ou d'influences particulièrement marquées, car ce groupe (qui comprends un saxophone volubile, des guitares très habiles et une voix à l'aise dans tous les registres) fait montre dès ce premier album d'une personnalité, d'une fraîcheur, d'une originalité et d'un son déjà bien à lui. C'est cela, le génie (pop) anglais... A la suite de cet album à la fois sympathique et brillant, le groupe en a sorti deux autres (différents à en croire les critiques), respectivement en 2006 et 2008... Liverpool plus que jamais vivant!!!"
5,"""red earth"" une journée au Mali, tantôt pur folklore, tantôt jazz, notre belle Dee Dee nous invite à vivre avec Elle ses origines africaines. Toujours aussi généreuse, notre chanteuse, pour chacun de ses albums, apporte sa chaleur et sa touche personnelle. Chanteuse ""jazz"", chanteuse ""Musique du Monde"", Dee Dee est tout à la fois. J'ai eu le plaisir de la rencontrer et d'assister à plusieurs de ses concerts ; c'est une artiste qui vit sa passion et qui la partage avec son Public en toute simplicité, complicité et talent."
2,"AH LE VOILA LE BEST OF TANT ATTENDU DE LA MADONNE! ET BIEN ON S'ARRETE, ON REGARDE ET ON PASSE SON CHEMIN. RIEN DE BIEN ORIGINAL! JE M'ATTENDAIS A UN DOUBLE CD AU MOINS, MEME PAS. OU SONT DONC PASSES LES ""RAIN"", ""THIS USED TO BE MY PLAYGROUND"", ""AMERICAN PIE"": Y'EN A PAS! ET LES INEDITS, ON PEUT TOUJOURS LES CHERCHER... UN BEST OF, OUI, MAIS RIEN DE PLUS!"
2,"Certes, ce GHV2 est l'occasion de réecouter des chansons devenues classiques et de faire le point sur une décennie 90's marquante et pleine de renouvellement pour Madonna. Contrairement à ""The Immaculate Collection"", le seul et gros problème de cette collection est qu'elle n'apporte RIEN de nouveau aux fans qui, comme moi, possedent dèja la totalité des albums.  Aucun nouveau titre ou inédit. Une compilation faite à la hâte pour les fêtes de nöel. Une question s'impose: Aura-t-on un jour l'occasion de posséder les fantastiques remixes de ""Impressive Instant"" par Peter Rauhofer et de ""What It Feels Like For A Girl"" par Thunderpuss?"
2,"Il est indispensable d'avoir un best of de Dalida, chanteuse exceptionnelle dans sa collection personnelle... mais pas celui là qui est franchement décevant! Le boîtier est beau mais fragile et salissant. Les chansons sont variées mais ne rendent pas vraiment compte de l'immense talent de la star. A revoir!"
4,"Sur le groupe, rien à dire, les musiciens sont tout le temps aussi extras ! Mais parlons un peu du public, je trouve que l'ambiance est un peu mauvaise, je m'attendais à voir une meilleur ambiance ! Sinon un dvd assez bon dans l'ensemble !"
5,"J'ai toujours beaucoup aimé la voix de Nolwenn Leroy mais j'avais été très déçu par son premier album. Je n'ai pourtant pas pu m'empêcher d'acheter ce nouveau. Et j'ai vraiment bien fait! Une très belle surprise. Des chansons très mélodieuses, travaillées jusqu'à la perfection. La voix de Nolwenn est posée de manière très juste sans forcer et avec beaucoup de douceur. Les textes sont très recherchés, il y a un vrai travail d'écriture, avec de très beaux textes comme, ""Reste Encore"" ou ""Mon Ange"" ou ""Mystère"" et plein d'autres. Je conseille vraiment à tout le monde d'acheter cet album vous ne serez pas déçu, il est très beau et on ne se lasse jamais de l'écouter."
5,"L'achat de ce CD c'est vraiment bien passé et m'a rassuré. En effet, je craignais la qualité du produit ( rayures, mauvais état ... ) et les conditions d'envoi. En fait, tout c'est bien passé, et même si le CD est d'occasion, il n'y a pas de rayure, il ne saute pas, le prix est avantageux et l'envoi a été rapide et soigné. Disons que ce premier achat m'a beaucoup rassuré sur l'achat de CD par Internet. En même temps, tout dépend du vendeur, et là, particulièrement, je tire mon chapeau à ma vendeuse !"
1,J.J. Goldman parle d'hommage... Parlons plutôt de dommages tant la qualité des arangements et des compositions est douteuse. Quelle déception pour un projet qui paraissait ambitieux et passionant.
5,"Les poèmes de l'album sont de très jolis textes, bien mis en valeur par le piano et les instruments à cordes et magnifiquement interprétés par Nolwenn. Quelle pureté et quelle belle amplitude de voix!!! Enfin, une grande voix française! Tous les morceaux sont superbes. Le succès est assuré pour un certain nombre de ces mélodies. On sent un très grand professionnalisme dans la conception de cet album malgré le peu de temps pour le sortir (un mois et demi) C'est le début d'une longue et belle carrière pour Nolwenn. Un CD à posséder absolument"
4,"Cet énième album de Johnny, c'est celui des rencontres et des retrouvailles. Rencontres avec son fils et avec la romancière Françoise Sagan. Retrouvailles avec Philippe Labro. Johnny, à près de 60 ans, joue toujours du rock'n'roll. Et il en joue fort bien.Qui peut y trouver à redire ?"
1,"Après le moyen ""Sevas Tra"", voici le mauvais ""House of Secrets"". Cet album est un véritable carnage. Point de ""tuerie"" à l'horizon, visez plutôt les cachets d'aspirine. La voix (si on peut appeler ça comme ça) de la miss est exaspérante. Quant à la musique, c'est une éternelle répétition. Mais qu'ont-ils cherché à faire? On écoutant cet album, j'ai eu l'impression de réentendre ""Sevas Tra"" mais on moins bon. Pas de ""Blood Pig"" en vue. Deux chansons et j'ai compris... NAVRANT! Franchement, je ne me souviens pas avoir écouté un si mauvais album depuis bien longtemps. Aucune chanson ne sort véritablement du lot. Certaines parties musicales sont pas mal mais se répètent bien trop souvent!!! Dommage! Une grande déception pour ce groupe que je voulais apprécier. Un conseil, gardez votre argent pour un autre album. Quand je pense que certains comparaient cette fille à un Jonathan Davis au féminin. Sacrilège. Elle ne lui arrive même pas à la cheville (si on pouvait comprendre ce qu'elle beugle). FF"
2,"Il est vrai que cet album comporte vraiment tous les ingrédients pour plaire... mais je ne peux pas m'empêcher de penser à radiohead. Je trouve qu'on force le trait de la sensibilité (blackout, apocalypse please) l'âme qu'ils veulent nous retranscrire dans leurs mélodies ne me convint pas. Que nous ammènent-ils de plus? on peut s'inspirer mais pas plagier."
1,Un album vraiment loin des commentaires que j'ai pu lire et entendre à son sujet. Muse en fait tellement que ça en devient lassant. On a l'impression que tout est fait pour épater la galerie (en particulier le son du groupe) et pour masquer des compositions finalement assez pauvres et pas très originales (cela rappelle beaucoup du Queen période commerciale et du Radiohead). Mais Bellamy est loin d'avoir la voix de Mercury ou de Thom Yorke.
5,Showbiz est un album extraordinairement...beau...!!
5,"Au delà de la New wave, des cure, et tutti quanti, s'est trouvé un groupe bien au dessus des autres dans leur création, leur originalité, et surtout dans leur travail. Démarant avec la vague punk en 1976 au coté des sex pistols, ils ont su construire au fur et à mesure de leurs albums une musique incroyables aux très multiples influences sur laquelle se pose la voix de Siouxsie Sioux et là c'est du grand art. Cette compilation regroupe les neuf premiers singles enregistrés en studio (et 1 faces b) du groupe. inoubliable!! Siouxsie &amp; the banshees est le seul (et absolument le seul) groupe pop que j'écoute régulièrement sans un brun de lassitude..."
5,"Voila une compilation de James Brown à la hauteur,une selection de quelques unes de ce qu'il a fait de mieux sur la musique qui l'a lui même crée la funk.l'époque 1970 à 1975, comme beaucoup le savent,est la plus prolifique artistiquement,le génie de James s'exprime totalement,et l'histoire va en être marquée à jamais.tous les titres sont de pures chefs d'oeuvres sans exceptions,certainement à l'écoute de ce double cd,beaucoup iront à la recherche d'autres oeuvres majeures de cette période du parrain de la soul."
5,"Cet album était attendu comme le loup blanc par les fans. Nouveau groupe, nouveau son, et les quenottes qui gigotent après avoir vu le CD dans ma boîte aux lettres. CD chargé.... cages à miel grande ouvertes.... here we go. Le son a changé, plus péchu, plus brut. Le batteur est un grand malade (surtout en concert à la Cigale, où il a reçu une ovation méritée de 2 ou 3 min). Le guitariste fait bien le boulot, idem pour le bassiste. Et monsieur Ben est toujours aussi inspiré. Adieu donc le gospel, le blues et les sons épurés (rhâââ « Like a king », où es-tu ?). Malgré tout, ceux qui connaissent un peu Ben Harper ne seront pas perdus, loin de là, on retrouve la signature de maître Ben. Pas de révolution, donc. Mention spéciale au calme « The word suicide », magnifique mélodie où la guitare se distingue particulièrement (sobriété, quand tu nous tiens). Idem pour « Lay There And Hate Me », excellentissime, ainsi que « Boots Like These » et son rythme endiablé ! Bref, en trois mots : Merci monsieur Ben !"
5,"découvert lors d'une décentralisation du NJP (Nancy Jazz Pulsation) j'ai été transportée par ce trio .ambiance africaine, urbaine,indienne, ... pour tous ceux qui aiment les voyages."
5,Musique à consonnance Dub magnifiquement diriger par une chanteuse à la voie de velours Dhikrayat est un bijou pour toute les oreilles avertis Voyage garantie De koi être fièr car c 'est un groupe français!!!!! A possèder d'urgence
5,"Je n'ai pas écouté ce disque depuis des années et pourtant je chante encore, de temps à autres, Sally Free And Easy, l'excellente traduction (je suis né...) de ce texte Y-B Kalloc'h (Me zo ganet et kreiz ar mor), Silvestrig, et puis ce Broceliande (""pom pom pom"" et refrain en breton compris). Meme si cet albumn'est  pas vraiment rock (comparé à Live à l'Olympia, Chemins de terre ou Live à Dublin), on reconnait néanmoins dans Broceliande, une sorte d'acte de naissance du rock celtique, tant la faconqu'a Stivell d'interpréter ce morceau est imprégné de ce type de musique."
5,"le commentaire de hubert deshouse est très judicieux. c'est un album musicalement excellent. peter erskine à la batterie, entre autre, donne une leçon de simplicité et d'éfficacité dans le groove. batteur, à vos platines cd ! pour ceux qui sont chrétiens, ils retrouveront dans cet album une expression de foi très réconfortante, surtout dans le morceau what can i do for you. Dylan parle au Seigneur, et ça nous parle. merci dylan !"
2,"Bob est dans sa grande période chrétien-illuminé. Ne m'en veuillez pas si je préfère sa phase poète-juif. Regardez la pochette et vous aurez tout compris... Une production maladroite, surchargée en chœurs féminins, lorgnant vers du mauvais gospel, accompagne le chanteur my(s)thique dans des compositions souvent plates, à une ou deux exceptions près.  En fait, le titre phare - car il y a bien une perle sur « Saved » -  se nomme « Solid' Rock » : un régal ! Pour le reste, soit l'on s'en accommode, soit l'on s'ennuie profondément, mais une chose et sûre cependant : il y a de quoi regretter de n'avoir pas acheter « Blonde on Blonde » ou « Desire » à la place !"
5,"c'est un éblouissant parcours que nous offre Vanessa, des Cd qui correcpondent à son âge, sa maturité naissante et la femme assurée. Ses premiers titres n'ont pas vieilli et sont encore sur nos ondes, on aime les fredonner. Lorsuqe Vanessa sortira son dernier album ""bliss"", ce ne sera pas une surprise, mais l'évidence même, la suite logique, le complément. Ces trois premiers Cd de Vanessa resteront très longtemps dans nos mémoires. Ce jour-là, une artiste passionnée et qui se découvre peu à peu, était née."
5,"Pour ceux qui ne connaissent pas la discographie de Tom Jones (ce qui était mon cas avant de faire l'acquisition de ce disque), cet album va furieusement leur donner envie de découvrir les chansons qui ont jalonné la carrière de l'artiste. La puissance de la voix de Tom Jones vous électrise , tantôt soutenue tantôt mise en relief par les voix de ses invités. La rythmique est extraordinaire et la diversité des morceaux fait passer l'album à une vitesse incroyable."
1,"Le prix des disques de la Platinum Collection de Warner en fait a priori des produits attrayants sur un écran d'ordinateur mais, croyez moi, il s'agit d'une petite arnaque. Je ne remets pas en cause la qualité de la musique que contiennent ces compilations, ni même la selection des titres, mais les pochettes sont extrêmement peu fournies. Il n'y a pas de liner notes, à moins d'une bio en cinq lignes des artistes en question, pas de photo, pas de credits détaillés, bref, rien qui ne vous permettra d'apprécier le disque au delà de la musique. Si les artistes R&amp;B d'Atlantic vous intéressent, jetez vous plutôt sur les Best of d'Atlantic (exemples: ""Snatching it back"" de Clarence Carter  ou ""Home in your heart"" de Solomon Burke), bien mieux garnis et guère plus chers. L'intérets de ce type de sélections, c'est de nous offrir une introduction à un artiste, sa musique, mais aussi sa carrière, son univers, ses connections avec d'autres artistes, etc... Cette Platinum Collection, c'est une invitation au téléchargement. Ils devraient inscrire sur leurs pochettes: ""pour plus d'infos sur l'artiste, rendez-vous sur Wikipedia""."
5,"ca r'commence, le svink c'est chic! Une pure bombe slip-hop lancée dans le rap français, plutôt morose ces derniers temps. Comme à leur habitude, les 3 joyeux lurons nous propose un mix de bon son, de bonne bitures, et sourtout de bonne humeur. Si vous avez aimé ""Tapis rouge"" et ""Juste fais la"", pas de souci, ""Bon pour l'asile"" est fait pour vous."
1,superbe galette d'une music spatio intemporelle avec des images qui font voyager loin. ENCORE BRAVO aux musiciens et à leur subtil humour La Jamaique est toute petite sur le globe mais rares sont les pingouins qui ignorent qu'elle est grande dans notre coeur.
5,"Douceur des mélodies, pertinence des cordes: de grands moments de sensualité en l'hommage des femmes libanaises. Laissez-vous happer, fermez les yeux et rêvez! Un nouvel opus tout en grâce. gilles"
1,niéseux et repetitif attention c'est pas du jazz recomandé pour ceux qui aime la musique de pub pour les saussices
2,"Après le déception des ""Elements part 1 &amp; 2"", j'attendais avec quelques inquiétudes ce nouveau STRATOVARIUS... Ayant personnellement adoré Episode et Infinite, je reste là encore sur ma faim. On trouve certes quelques bons titres aux riffs accrocheurs mais l'ensemble reste très moyen, ça manque d'inspiration &amp; le groupe semble s'essouffler. Pour inconditionnels seulement. Dommage."
2,"waie aie-aie. Je m'étais arrété à ce groupe à l'album ""infinite"" donc j'en ai loupé pas mal. Mais je trouve ce nouvel album 2005 complèmement plat!!! Où sont donc ces superbes mélodies et ces refrains enchanteurs inoubliables,presque des hymnes? C'est franchement décevant. je mettrai tout çà sur le compte des problèmes internes qui ont éclaté au saint du groupe,oui,voilà c'est çà.... Enfin j'espère... Un album donc à réserver aux fans du groupe."
4,"c'est frais, ça fais vraiment un bien fou, les paroles sont profondes mais pas besoin d'avoir fais de longues études pour comprendre, c'est tous simplement de LA BONNE MUSIQUE !"
2,"Je ne met que 2 étoiles parce ke étant fan de sinse j'ai eu une petite déception. En effet, dans cet opus, ils nous souhaitent tout le bonheur du monde mais ne nous le procur plus. C'est domage. Un cruel manque d'imagination les pousses a reprendre une chanson de leurs ancien album ""Résistance"" mais rien a fair ce n'est pas ""Résistance"". Je note quand même une belle version de ""Marlène"" de noir désir. Cet album est plus que moyen en CD mais est plutôt bien en Live. La morale de cette histoire est que malgré un album pas terrible, les sinse restes des bêtes de scène qui merrites quand même le succè qu'on leurs conai !!! On oubli sa et on attend le prochain (2007)."
1,"Vraiment, j'ai du chroniquer ce CD et ca a pas été facile, parce que j ai du l'écouter plusieurs fois... En dehors du fait que je considère que c'est de la musique pour ados et que c'est pas mon genre préféré, je déteste le coté politique de l'album: certes ils détestent Chirac et Sarko mais ils font des soirées dans les écoles de commerce... Qu'on soit pour ou contre c pas le pbm, c'est juste qu'il faut être logique...  Donc je mets une étoile, juste pour la chanson qui est une insulte à l'anglais mais qui est à mourir de rire vu l'accent (daïng eulone ...)"
4,"Ce disque est plein de charme. La rencontre de ces deux artistes met en évidence leur richesse personnelle... Sans être absolu, ce CD est très agréable à écouter, pour celui qui aime la musique. Pour exemple, je choisirai la deuxième partie de ""Blues sur seine""; de l'accordéon et de la contrabasse au sommet. Un plaisir..."
1,Vraiment déçu à l'écoute de cette compilation :
5,Je pensais Passi vendu au rap-variété. Je me trompais. Ce disque est revendicatif à souhait tout en amenant des musiques entre Afrique et rap classique du meilleur effet. Passi est vraiment un grand artiste.
2,"Franchement le Hip hop français se porte très mal et c'est pas rohff qui va inverser la tendance ! On le considère comme l'un des meilleurs mc actuel : certes il enchaine bien les mots et les instrus de son album sont de bonne qualité mais ça s'arrète là ! Sur 28 pistes rohff passe son temps en Ego tripe c'est a dire a expliquer qu'il est le meilleur des rappeurs, au bout de la troisieme ecoute ça soule, pour moi c' est un rappeur qui n'a pas grand choses a dire ni a revendiquer( a par que c'est lui le meilleur ) et ça donne des lyrics repetitives et sans impacte sur  l'auditeur, il en ressort un album faiblard que l'on ecoute uniquement pour la qualité de la production . On est en droit d'attendre mieu d'un MC considéré comme le meilleur de sa génération !"
1,"Entre les versions ""45 tours"" qui n'ont rien à voir avec les versions qui sont sur les albums et les clips en version live, que reste-t'il ? Vaut mieux reprendre la collection complète de ses cd et les réécouter en boucle !"
1,"Certainement l'une des pires choses que les années 80 dans leur plus horrible configuration (synthé pourri, son abominable, romantisme niais...) ont dû nous donner!! Musicalement, The Human League avait dû se fixer comme objectif de faire pire que Giorgio Moroder!! Pas une mince affaire... Dare, cependant, réussi deux exploits. En effet, il contient la chanson la plus minable de la pop (""Do or Die"") et les paroles les plus nullissimes jamais écrite par un individu en pleine possession de ses capacités intellectuelles (""The Things That Dreams Are Made Of""). En d'autres termes, un bel exemple de synthé-pop ratée des trés dichotomiques années 80. Pour le bon côté, se tourner vers Depeche Mode ou Joy Division (côté synthé), Sonic Youth, Killing Joke ou The Smiths (versant guitare)."
2,"Premier opus des NIAGARA. Un album gentillet rempli de chansons acidulées représentant bien la pop des années 80. A écouter pour les 4 tubes : ""Tchiki boum"", ""L'amour à la plage"", ""Je dois m'en aller"" et ""Quand la ville dort""."
1,Il ne s'agit pas de l'édition limitée avec livret de 94 pages [...]
5,"Bien sûr, on a fait beaucoup + de louanges à ""Diesel &amp; Dust"", ""Blue Sky Mining"" ou encore ""10 to 1"" et pourtant, beaucoup moins connu, cet album est probablement le plus abouti de la carrière de Midnight Oil. ""E&amp;S&amp;M"" est un mélange original de rock, pop, folk, surf music et d'une petite dose de psychédélisme bien sentie. Les titres s'enchainent sans temps mort. Garrett et ses musiciens atteignent des sommets de créativité. Bien que pas très technique, il module sa voix avec intelligence. Les guitares cristallines s'entrecroisent dans une complémentarité d'effets sans faille, des arrangements déroutants de synthé d'un autre âge ainsi que bien autres instruments enrichissent l'ensemble, la basse est chaude et virevoltante et le talentueux batteur abuse de contretemps d'une précision chirurgicale. On ne peut surtout pas éviter ces fabuleuses harmonies vocales, que n'auraient pas renié les Beach Boys et les Beatles, qui explosent à chaque refrain. La sincérité et la force des textes du groupe n'est plus à démontrer. Ici ils se font toutefois plus posés, dépeignant l'Australie avec une certaine poésie sans pour autant délaisser les sujets récurrents. ""E&amp;S&amp;M"" est d'une énergie et d'une fraîcheur désarmantes qui ravira n'importe quel auditeur à la recherche d'un album de rock peu conventionnel et indémodable."
5,"Ah quelle belle bouffée d'oxygène dans le monde du Blues qui avait eu tendance ces derniers temps à s'endormir un peu sur ses fondamentaux (on adore mais on attend un peu de sang neuf tout de même)!! Si vous aimez un Blues péchu, incisif, sachant s'inspirer autant de l'esprit de Stevie Ray Vaughan que de la rage de vivre des meilleurs albums de Jonny Lang vous ne serez pas déçu par ce magnifique album de Albert Cummings.  D'ailleurs, pour vous en convaincre il suffit d'entendre le premier morceau de l'album : dès le premier riff le ton est donné qui vous scotch sur votre fauteuil et vous redonne cette énergie explosive qui fait du blues la ""musique du diable"". Après quelques minutes on comprend bien là qu'une nouvelle étoile est née.  Et cette impression ne se dément pas au fil de l'écoute des morceaux qui suivent : ça vous réveille, vous ébouriffe et vous secoue comme si l'on montait, en écoutant les riffs de guitare de Albert Cummings, dans une montagne russe aux sensations grisantes. Voilà longtemps que l'on attendait ce type d'album et l'on se surprend déjà à attendre avec impatience une suite aussi excitante.  Voilà un album qu'il FAUT acheter absolument pour peu que l'on se réclame du blues de SRV... un must en cette fin d'année 2004 !!"
5,"Albert Cummings est né en 1968 aux U.S.A dans l'état du Massachusetts, il commence à jouer du banjo à 12 ans et devient fan de bluegras. Puis il écoute Stevie Ray Vaughan et est émerveillé par la virtuosité du musicien, du coup, à 27 ans, il se met à la guitare électrique et s'avère très doué. 'True to yourself' est son 3ème album et sort en 2004. C'est une petite bombe ! Une guitare mordante, un son charnu (produit par Jim Gaines) un feeling évident, une ryhtmique percutante avec Tommy Shannon (S.R.V) à la basse font que des titres comme ""man on tour mind"" ou ""separately"" sont imparables ! Un excellent blues lent ""lonely bed"" permet au guitariste de délivrer des solos trainants de toute beauté et des effets de son (wha-wha) enrichissent une guitare inspirée dans ""your sweet love"". Un remarquable album qui, en 10 titres, nous sidère pendant près de 45mn."
5,"Formé en 1968 dans le sillage des Byrds et du Buffalo Springsfield, Poco propose depuis quatre décennies un mélange de rock, de country et de pop avec de superbes harmonies vocales. Sans jamais avoir eu le succés des Eagles, Poco est un groupe qui propose un ""country-rock"" de grande qualité. Cette compilation regroupe de superbes titres comme ""pickin'up the pieces"",""rose of Cimarron"", ""crazy love"" ou ""heat of the night"". Les années passent et l'étalon aux yeux rouges galope toujours...... A plus de soixante printemps, Paul Cotton et Rusty Young, les deux piliers du groupe, sont toujours en activité, faisant des tournées aux États-Unis, Canada et en Europe et enregistrant toujours des albums.  Si vous aimez les Eagles,America,Jackson Browne,James Taylor,Crosby &amp; Nash....tous les artistes emblématiques du soft rock californien, this record is for you....."
1,"Peut-on être sérieux deux petites minutes? On reproche à cet album de ne pas ressembler à du Helloween... OK, c'est vrai, Chameleon ne ressemble absolument pas à ce que le groupe a pu offrir auparavant (ni à ce qu'il offrira par la suite), MAIS le problème est plus grave que cela: c'est juste un album très médiocre, quelque soit le style de musique auquel il se réfère.  Certains fans tentent de le ""remonter"" en disant que c'est un bon album, juste pas un bon album de métal. FAUX. Il n'est juste... pas bon! J'écoute beaucoup de pop ou de rock, et les piètres compositions de nos amis teutons (pour qui j'ai pourtant une grande admiration) ne pourraient figurer sur un bon album, même de pop. Quel manque d'inspiration! Que de mélodies enfantines! Que d'arrangements de mauvais goût! Franchement, ""Windmill""... Autant de mièvrerie en cinq minutes, quelle indigestion! ""I don't wanna cry no more"", ""In the night"": pareil.  Alors, c'est vrai, quelques chansons sont sympathiques, comme ""First Time"", ""Giants"" ou ""I believe"", et l'album est extrêmement bien produit (un des meilleurs sons de leur carrière probablement). Cela suffit-il à faire passer la gêne ou l'ennui que l'on ressent à l'écoute de ce très long disque? Malheureusement, non! Allez, il faut l'avouer et arrêter de chercher des excuses à cet album parce qu'on aime le groupe, ou parce que l'on cherche à démontrer qu'on est ""ouvert"": Helloween s'est égaré, ça arrive... mais depuis, ils ont bien retrouvé leur chemin."
4,"c'est en 1979 que parait ""angel station"", cette periode marque la fin des groupes progressifs produisant souvent des morceaux de 10 minutes . l'earth band ,tout comme genesis avec ""and then there were three"" reussit completement sa reconversion avec ce superbe album .pour les fan de ""school"" de supertramp ou ""tormato"" de yes .a posseder absoluement!!!!!!!!"
2,"Bof, vraiment trés Bof ..... Un album a mon goût trés plat, trés calme : TROP calme .... Trés peu de diversité dans les morceaux, un opus plus orienté ""world music"" et pop que reggae, ragga &amp; funk comme sur les anciens albums ... Trés peu de cuivres dans les instrumentaux, beaucoup de ballades un peu mievres...(Franchement pas + de 3 ou 4 morceaux ""interressants"") Il me semble d'ailleurs que ses musiciens ont changé et que ce n'est plus l'excellent ""Shashamani Band"" qui l'accompagne ... Patrice suit désormais sa route en solo et l'orientation musicale qu'il a choisi ne me plait pas vraiment .... Mais bon chacun ses goûts comme on dit ... Bref, vraiment pas emballé du tout par ce dernier album ..."
2,"Je suis la carrière de Papa Roach depuis Infest et avant. les rois des cancrelas ont choisi une orientation musicale que je comprends de moins en moins. de rap, aux puissantes ballades en passant par les passages hurlés de ""love hate tragedy"", les 4 lascars avaient fourni un travail de remises en questions impressionnants. avec paramour sessions très peu de titres se démarquent (peu être ""What do you do"") tous se ressemblent plus médiocres les uns que les autres et ne laissent pas un souvenir impérissable. où est passé la fougue nihiste et naive de ""Between angels and insects"" ou le blues de ""Scars""? déçu."
5,"Le meilleur du Rock Américain (même s'il est Canadien). Ca sent bon les années 80, Huey Lewis et quelques autres. On se regarderait bien Mad Max et Retour vers le Futur. Quant à l'autre commentaire, il est un peu injuste : essayez On A Day Like Today pour voir. Et pour découvrir Bryan ADAMS, un très bon best-of : So Far So Good."
2,"Bizarrement je dois être le seul à ne pas avoir succombé aux onze pépites de ce disque! Chef d'oeuvre indispensable selon certains, je serai beaucoup plus réservé sur ce deuxième opus des cinq new-yorkais. Certes on retrouve toujours la (même) ligne conductrice basse-batterie plus ou moins rapide, que sur ""Is this it"" (que j'avais particulièrement apprécié) seulement les riff et les mélodies sont moins accrocheuses, l'inventivité n'est pas, non plus, l'adjectif auquel on pense en premier ce qui a pour conséquence une suite de titres beaucoup trop évidents. L'exemple typique est le single ""The end has no end"" que vous avez pu entendre dans une pub: Trés efficace à là première écoute mais au bout de la troisième on zappe! C'est malheureusement le cas pour les autres titres de ""Room on fire"" à l'exception de ""Reptilia"" et ""Automatic stop"". La réussite du successeur ""First impressions of earth"" démontrera qu'il s'agissait d'un accident de parcours. Ouf!"
5,"Rock expérimental, planant et sensuel. Parfois bruyant, parfois minimaliste, on est trainé par le va-et-vient des vagues de guitares et pour finalement se laisse emporter dans un voyage intérieur unique. Excellents sur scène également (je ne sais pas s'ils jouent encore...)"
2,"Fan(e) de Delpech et de Readymade FC, je ne vois pas très bien l'intérêt de ces reprises arrangées de manière vieillotte, mal chantées et lestées de choeurs inélégants. Mieux vaut revenir à Delpech, à readymade FC et acheter le dernier Higelin qui, lui, ne sonne pas creux !"
1,"J'aime Saxon, ou plutôt J'ADORE Saxon. Aussi, quand nouvel album il y a, je choisi inmanquablement l'édition Digipack: Pour l'objet bien sûr, pour son contenu surtout. Sauf que pour une fois, la partie bonus est une pure arnaque: Un film de 20 mn du genre médiéval,  réalisé par un Espagnol quelquonque, qui n'a pour seul particularité (originalité) que le fait de mettre en scène Biff lui même. S'en suit un long documentaire sur les derniers ""Joujoux technologiques"" employés par le staff du Waken, entrecoupé de quelques images Live filmées lors de la tournée ""Inner sanctum"" de qui vous savez... Et rideau ! Une dernière plage, uniquement audio (???) laisse s'exprimer Biff sur la réalisation du nouvel album. En Anglais bien sûr et non sous titré. Autant dire que pour une première mise en appétit... sa commence très mal.  Venons en au principal, l'album lui même: Premier constat, la production a été reconfié à Charlie Bauerfeind. Et de ce côté là nous sommes rassuré, le gars s'y connait: Sa sonne.  Arrive le premier morceau. L'intro laisse de suite augurer du meilleur. Malheureusement, le soufflé retombe aussitôt. Saxon pompe. Et ici, la relique est à chercher du côté des Nightwish (beurk !), Within machin chose et tout l'tralala ""Symphonitico Metalo"" pompeux; Pas ma tasse de thé vous l'aurez compris.  Le deuxième morceau se veut tout de suite beaucoup plus rassurant. ""Live to Rock"" est du pur Saxon (estampillé Accept et/ou AC/DC) hyper efficasse à défaut d'être original.  Ensuite le groupe s'enlise de nouveau dans tout (absolument tous) les clichés que peut revêtir parfois ce type de heavy Metal: Alternance de Speed Metal (tagadagadagada ...), de lourdeur pachidermique, de duel de solis en rafale...... Stoooooooop !!  Mais p..... ! Qu'est ce que vous avez foutu ? J'y serais volontier resté, moi, dans ce labyrinth. Encore aurait-il fallut que je puisse y trouver l'entrée. Mais ce disque est un vrai ""fourre tout"" . Un peu plus de simplicité, de vraies mélodies, je n'en demandais pas plus.  Ca joue... Oui ! Mais n'importe quoi et n'importe comment. Alors cette fois ci, désolé messieurs, se sera sans moi. 05/20"
5,"Le calme et la sérénité de cet album font un bien fou. De sa voix tranquille et sans manières (ce qui devient rare), Voulzy nous gâte avec cette collection de chansons idéales pour l'été. Sur des rythmes bossa nova ou simplement accompagné d'une guitare, Voulzy s'approprie chaque chanson jusqu'à en détourner certaines de leurs origines (cf. SANTIANO). Les arrangements sont simples mais efficaces. On a l'impression    que Voulzy chante chaque chanson pour vous seulement tellement l'ambiance de l'album est intimiste. Cependant, il ne faut pas douter que le perfectionniste Voulzy aura travailler chaque chanson pendant des heures. C'est là la magie de Voulzy, des mélodies simples sur des arrangements simples mais le tout est le résultat d'un travail d'orfèvre. C'est sans doute l'un des meilleurs albums de l'année, et il ne faut pas forcément être un fan de Voulzy pour apprécier cet album. Il vous caresse les oreilles comme la vague vous caresse les pieds quand vous marchez le long de la mer."
2,"Bon, je dois dire que honnêtement, mettre quatre ans pour sortir des titres mille fois entendus ailleurs (et avec plus de brio), non, ce n'est pas du Voulzy tel qu'on nous le présente habituellement (Simon and Garfunkel... massacrés par exemple). On nous disait que la Septième vague serait l'albulm de l'été. Peut-être, mais il ne restera pas dans les annales.  2 étoiles pour la présence d'une chanson bonus après light the fire, mais  je ne me rappelle plus du titre."
4,"Eric Serra n'est pas né de la dernière pluie, et en tous les cas pas avec la musique du ""Grand Bleu"". Avant cela, il y a eu notamment la musique de ""Subway"". Et c'est là qu'on comprend le talent du compositeur car autant ""Le Grand Bleu"" invitait à l'évasion, autant la musique de ""Subway"" est diablement urbaine, presque noire. Bravo Eric pour ce talent à multiples facettes."
2,"Sleeping With Ghosts est surprenant. Oui surprenant... mais dans un sens vraiment imprévu.  Tout au début, l'attente d'un chef-d'oeuvre semblait justifiée. Rien que le titre nous laissait présager un album aux tonalités romantiques à l'image du magnifique ""Without You I'm Nothing"". Brian Molko était sensé avoir revêti sa cicatrice d'amoureux meurtri et transi, laissé dans la solitude après l'extase du couple -cicatrice qui exacerbait sa créativité. Le concept de ""fantôme"" était très bien choisi pour décrire la fin d'un coupe -ce ""nous"" qui n'est plus et ce ""je"" qui a du mal à reprendre sa place dans la vie quotidienne."
2,"C'est encore du ""vieux"" que Mylène nous propose.Après un best of, on s'attendait à avoir un nouvel album studio. Que nenni, on nous sort une compil de remixes (aussi inutiles les uns que les autres) pour se mettre de l'argent plein les poches en cette période de fin d'annnée. Quelle deception !!!"
5,"Voici le Best Of des Beatles de la partie de leur carrière où ils sont au sommet de leur Art. Alors oui, ce 'Blue Album' est vraiment un disque formidable. Sont compilées ici leurs chansons des années 1967-1968-1969. On va ainsi d'abord retrouver les grands succès de leur période psychédélique comme ""Lucy in the sky with diamonds"", ""Penny Lane"" ou encore ""All you need is love"". Viennent ensuite les morceaux de 68, avec par exemple le phénoménale ""Hey Jude"" de Mc Cartney ou l'excellentissime ""While my guitar gently weeps"" de Harrison. Puis, on termine en beauté avec 69 et les hits de l'album 'Abbey Road' tels que ""Something"", ""Here come's the sun"" ou encore le fantastique ""Come together"" de Lennon. Pour clore ce super 'Best Of', des petits bijoux de ballades dont le merveilleux ""Let it be"". Un album indispensable pour ceux qui veulent découvrir ou faire découvrir les Beatles. Ca mérite au moins 6 étoiles."
5,"Après la tournée promotionnelle d' « Iron Fist », Fast Eddie Clarke quitta Motörhead pour, avec l'aide de Pete Way en rupture d'UFO (d'où le patronyme Fast + Way), s'adonner à un Heavy-rock millésimé 1ère moitiée des 70's baignant dans le Blues, à l'instar et principalement d'Humble Pie et de Led Zep, en gommant soigneusement leur côté folk, pour ne garder que leur essence Rock et Blues (voire Soul). D'ailleurs ce n'est pas par hasard que la batterie sera assurée par Jerry Shirley, ex-Humble Pie, et le chant par un nouveau talent qui marche sans complexe, et avec honneur, sur les contrées de Robert Plant (mais aussi en filigrane sur Steve Marriott et Janis Joplin). 	Way abandonnera le projet (pour Ozzy), et sera remplacé par un bassiste de studio pour l'enregistrement du 1er opus. Charlie McCraken (ex-Taste, fleuron du Blues rock irlandais à la fin des 60's avec Rory Gallagher) prendra la relève pour la scène et l'album suivant (où la basse sera en toute logique plus présente). 	Eddie troquera sa Strato contre une Les Paul, mais restera fidèle au jeu qu'il développa au sein de Motörhead, notamment sur « Overkill » &amp; « Bomber », tout en ralentissant le tempo. Des riffs concis, résumant l'idiome des groupes mentionnés, mais aussi du « Boogie Brothers » de Savoy Brown, de l' « Imagination Lady » de Chiken Shack » avec parfois un petit quelque chose de Foghat sans la slide de feu ; et des soli incandescents, gorgés de feeling, souvent travaillés par une Wah-Wah épaisse et fumante. 	Il en résultera deux disques faramineux, deux brûlots hors du temps (produits par Eddie Kramer), débordants d'un Hard-Blues transcendant, vivant, puissant, dégageant une énergie brute palpable, et enrichi de rythmes saisissants presque hypnotiques. Une véritable bouffée d'air pur qui aura un accueil retentissant, notamment aux USA où le single « Say what you will » cartonnera. P.S. : les quelques rares parties acoustiques étaient jouées par Dave King, car Clarke, suivant ses propres dires, n'a pas le feeling nécessaire sur cet instrument. Pour Fast Eddie, c'est électrique sinon rien !"
1,"Le nouvel album de Françis Lalanne est bien loin de la qualité de l'album précédent "" reptile "" ou même de l'album "" d'une vie à l'autre "". Autant "" reptile "" était dynamique, avec une musique forte, celui ci est lassant. Françis Lalanne reprend son combat entre le bien et le mal, certes, avec des sujets actuels, mais que c'est fatiguant. Dommage, vraiment dommage."
1,"Nous connaissions Sandrine actrice moyenne de films moyens, nous la retrouvons une fois de plus chanteuse affligeante ; elle l'avoue elle-même en faisant constamment référence à 2 autres désastres de la chanson (sic!)Carla et Vanessa. Qui l'aurait éditée si elle n'était pas connue ? Déprimant."
1,What went wrong? Are these the B-Sides from the first album?  Je n'ai même pas envie de l'écouter une deuxième fois!
5,"Nous connaissions Laurent Garnier comme un DJ hors pair, mais comme compositeur pur, moins. Apres des albums excellents comme ""Shot in the dark"" et ""30"", il nous apporte un bijou de perfection, un album techno comme jamais nous n'en avions entendue. C'est de la ""BOMBE"", achetez-le si ce n'est pas fait. The ""French Touch"" exsiste, Laurent en est la preuve vivante."
1,"Il y a des groupes qui passent toujours inaperçus en France. Année après année, ils continuent à sortir des albums que personne (ou presque) n'écoute. Bon an mal an, ils survivent en agrandissant légèrement leur cercle de fans mais comparés à certains de leurs compagnons de pépinière qui remplissent les Zenith de province, ils sont cantonnés aux seuls Bataclan et Cigale parisiens. The Raveonettes fait partie de ces groupes maudits par le public français et ce n'est pas ce ""Lust, Lust, Lust"" qui leur permettra de sortir de l'ornière d' indifférence où ils sont semble-t-il bien engoncés. Car ce nouvel album de Raveonnettes a toutes les caractéristiques du suicide commercial : Options artistiques (autistiques ?) hyper tranchées, production qui nivelle tout, voix atones, guitares inaudibles, accords similaires sur tous les morceaux. ""Lust Lust Lust"" est une longue errance sonique où My Bloody Valentine ferait des reprises des Animals dans un hall de gare. Intrigants au début, les morceaux du duo danois deviennent vite lassants avant de finir pénibles et irritants. Inaudible plus d'une fois, donc."

5,"Musique inclassable, transcendente, qui touche et vibre au plus profond de soi. A ne pas manquer !"
5,"Délaissant le côté death, Opeth se livre à l'exercice accoustisque tout le long de cet album, exercice qu'il maîtrise parfaitement si l'on juge la qualité des  morceaux de ce style figurant sur les albums précédents  Ici point de guitare saturé, ni de chants gutturaux, simplement des chansons à l'atmosphère planante et intime teinté de mélancolie, à l'arrivée le résultat est superbe"
1,"Le son 'original' des Louise n'a malheureusement pas évolué. Le violon fait grincer les dents, les arrangements sont d'un monotone (tout comme les mélodies, d'ailleurs) et le chant est lassant. L'heure est peut-être venue de ranger les instruments et postuler pour des jobs au Monoprix du coin. Un fan déçu."
2,"Je trouve moi aussi que le ""Green Album"" n'a pas de quoi fouetter un chat, ok ""Hash Pipe"" et ""Island In The Sun"" sont 2 singles sympas mais loins derrière les très bons ""Buddy Holly"" ou ""Say It Ain't So"" (pour ne citer qu'eux) du premier album ! Pinkerton m'avait déjà un peu déçu mais je suis là je suis carrément dégoûté d'avoir acheter un CD d'à peine 29 minutes pour un tel résultat ! Repassez-vous plutôt ""The Blue Album"" !"
5,"Décidemment je ne comprend pas ceux qui arrivent à critiquer cet album. Du rythme, du rock, des tubes...cet album à véritablement tout pour séduire les amateurs de Weezer. Et pour ceux qui aiment le Punk en général. Indispensable dans toutes bonnes cdthèques. Un must."

5,"Et oui, nostalgie... Le début des annéees 90 est une période fertile qui voit l'émergence du death metal sur la scène internationale. Il y a bien sur différentes écoles, dont l école scandinave... OK Amorphis vient de Finlande et non pas de Suède, mais leur Death Metal mélodique tient bien de ce courant, comme en témoigne la production de thomas skorsberg. Bref, allons à l essentiel: si vous aimez le death metal mélodique, vous adorerez. On a vraiment l'impression d etre dans les forets au milieu des 1000 lacs, et la voie death (avec qques exceptions où la voix claire fait une apparition réussie) se marie à merveille avec la musique à la fois très lourde et mélodique. A noter que la production est plus léchée que sur le 1er album, le non moins excellent Karelian Isthmus, et que un claviériste rejoint le groupe, ce qui renforce l'aspect mélodique (notamment sur l'instrumentale du titre, tout simplement magnifique) Ce disque est un chef d'oeuvre absolu reconnu comme tel par tout expert de metal qui se respecte ... :) A posséder absolument."
2,"Encore un album que j'ai mis quelques siècles à me procurer ! La raison est simple, le dernier album de Leaves'Eyes n'est sorti que fin mai, et il m'a tellement enchanté que c'est seulement après que je me suis destiné à me procurer ce premier effort de Midnattsol (en Anglais: Midnight Sun). Quel rapport, me demanderez-vous ? Hé bien, il s'avère que la chanteuse de ce groupe, Carmen Espanaes, n'est autre que la petite soeur de... Liv Kristine, chanteuse de Leaves'Eyes ! Vous comprenez mieux maintenant ?  Bref, la petite soeur fait-elle au moins aussi bien que la grande ? Après de nombreuses écoutes, la réponse est... non, malheureusement. Mais rien de dramatique pour autant, c'est quand même le tout premier album du groupe et il est normal qu'il n'ait pas encore la carrure de ceux qui ont une carrière bien remplie. La première surprise, de taille, c'est la voix de la chanteuse: quand on connait le timbre de voix délicat de Liv, on peut légitimement penser à entendre plus ou moins la même chose de la part de la jeune chanteuse, en plus fluet encore vu qu'elle a quand même dix ans de moins. Hé bien, tout faux ! Non seulement la voix de Carmen est d'un naturel confondant, mais elle est également bien plus mature que celle de Liv, même si elle manque encore un poil d'assurance. Certains morceaux sont particulièrement réussis: ""Lament"", aux forts relents Misanthropiques dans son intro, est un excellent titre, tout comme les très bons ""Tårefall"", ""Infinite Fairytale"", ""På Leting"" ou encore le très beau ""Tapt Ao Håp"", qui conclut l'album. Malheureusement, le disque bénéficie d'une production un peu quelconque qui ne met pas suffisamment en valeur les nombreux très bons moments qui le parsèment, le rendant même par trop homogène dans l'ensemble, donnant l'impression que chaque morceau ressemble plus ou moins à celui qui l'a précédé, et surtout renforçant le côté ""premier jet"" de l'ensemble. C'est vraiment dommage, car il est évident que ce groupe dispose d'un potentiel énorme qu'il ne peut pas concrétiser à l'heure actuelle. Souhaitons franchement que le groupe se voit gratifié d'un meilleur son à l'avenir, car, avec une telle personnalité,  il a les moyens de devenir un grand groupe !"
1,"Pas grand chose à dire de cet album raté d'un groupe monté par le leader-chanteur de Tool... on a l'impression de voir un clone de ce groupe justement, façon commerciale, sans le talent et l'originalité qui les caractérisent. Jettez vous plutôt sur les opus de Tool, sans hésiter..."
2,"Avec Sing The Sorrow, on avait bien compris que c'en était fini le hardcore du début pour les américans d'AFI. Si l'album précédent était tout de même excellent, ce Decemberunderground a peu de saveur. Le ""concept"" pouvait pourtant paraître intéressant: une touche d'électro/cold wave derrière ces riffs punk-rock mais non, cet album est tout à fait manqué! Après une intro presque hip/hop et un ""Kill Caustic"" censé nous rappeler qu'ils en ont quand même encore entre les jambes, cette nouvelle livraison s'avoue être réellement fade. AFI s'est transformé en groupe de power-pop-punk à midinette et certaines chansons comme ""The Missing Frame"" ou ""The Interview"" sont vraiment désagréables! A défaut d'abvoir perdu leur âme, AFI gagne en coupe de cheveux emo ce qui ravira sûrement bon nombre de nouveaux fans, avides d'émotion et d'""originalité""...Affligeant!"
1,"A la mémoire de leur premier album, je ne comprend décidemment pas ce qui a bien pu arriver à ces génies arméno-newyorkais. C'était fluide, beau, racé et péchu, c'est devenu outrancier, brouillon, commercial, voire pathétique (holywood baseball?) Réécoutez ""War"" en boucle, un peu de ""spider"" en infusion et du ""shop suey"" en dessert, ça devrait vous faire oublier ce vilain album!"
1,"Fan depuis leurs debuts,j'ai été très déçu par cet album!!Mais que c'est-il passé dans leurs têtes!Je ne reconnais plus JUDAS!!Rob parti,on fait n'importe quoi??Rien à voir avec le HEAVY,avec le HEAVY de JUDAS!!En conclusion,un album moche comme la pochette!!!Le moins bon de PRIEST!!"
1,"où sont les boys de metallica? le son est affreux, james htfield a perdu sa voix et la batterie de lars ulrich a été remplaçée par des casseroles... cet album qui semble plaire aux fans de load et reload decevra les fans de la premiere heure comme moi, qui n'apprécient pas que metallica fasse du nu-metal"
2,"« La Liberté guidant le Peuple ». C'est le nom du tableau de Delacroix qui sert de visuel à ce Cd de Coldplay. Un tableau à la gloire des révolutionnaires français de 1830. Et c'est bien tout ce qu'il y a de révolutionnaire dans ce « Viva la Vida ». Qui est un Cd parfait. Trop. Consensuel à l'extrême avec ses gentilles mélodies, ses arrangements minutieusement travaillés, ses refrains à reprendre en choeur, et ses intros pour faire s'allumer briquets et portables en concert ... Aucune aspérité, aucune émotion. La perfection glacée et glaciale. Ce « Viva la Vida » ressemble à un de ces disques froids et surproduits d'il y a une vingtaine d'années, comme en publiaient Phil Collins ou Sting. Coldplay fait dans la pop. Tendance Obispo plutôt que Beatles. Tout le reste n'est que savant marketing. « Viva la Vida » est un Cd à ranger à côté de celui de Carla Sarkozy."
2,Ils ont pris le meilleur morceau du CD je suis déçue quand je l'ai écoutée
2,"Moi qui aimais la rapidité et la technique d'Oceanborn ; la virtuosité , la puissance et le lyrisme de Wishmaster , quel n'a pas été ma déception à l'écoute de cet nouvel album qui ne possède aucunes des qualités de leur autres albums et en plus Tarja ne chante pas très bien sur celui-ci , Nightwish a l'air de ce diriger vers une musique plus ""commercial"". DECEPTION !!!!"
2,"On demande confirmation. On a vu une fusée éclairante. Et puis, plus rien. C'est l'effet que fait cet album. Ce n'est pas foncièrement mauvais mais ça fait un peu ""pétard mouillé"". Issu de la grande vague des vrais-faux albums (sorti d'abord en 2005, il est re-commercialisé cette année), Flyleaf nous délivre un album pêchu, bien dynamité et dynamisant, mais sans grande originalité.  La voix est très proche d'Avril Lavigne (!!), la musique étant plutôt proche d'un Hoobastank... Le son est très bon, mais l'album très court (32 minutes au total) et très direct (moins de 3 minutes par chanson).  Quelques bons titres, qui surnagent : ""I'm so sick"" ou encore ""Breathe Today""...  Parfois intéressant, souvent pas très innovant. A suivre."
1,"Oh la la !Que c'est mauvais ca, ne reculant devant vraiment rien , je me suis lancé à l'ecoute de ce cd, et bien le resultat est encore pire que ce à quoi je m'attendais!Certains avaient trouvé dans  les premiers albums de Calogero quelque chose de (trés) vaguement interessant mais dans celui ci il faudrait qu'ils cherchent loin..Musiques langoureuses voire dégoulinantes à la sauce Obispo, textes insipides et plats, bref la ""patte"" Zazie (cf également son ""travail"" pour C.Willem..). extraits : Pomme C: ""elle m'ecrit mais mon ecran formate les sentiments""..il doit formater aussi les chanteurs.. Drole d'animal, message:chasser les oiseaux c'est pas bien, la bombe non plus..recyclage de la chanson genre je m'engage en enfoncant les portes ouvertes de Zazie ""je suis un homme"". Desolé mais ca reste de la variet bien calibrée, pseudo rock tendance Star ac et pseudo textes intellos torturés branchés. D'ailleurs on nous matraque en ce moment le single ""la debacle des sentiments"" du duo Calogero/ Stanislas et on y retrouve les memes orchestrations pompeuses et ennuyeuses, et si c'etait plutot la débacle de ce qui reste de la chanson francaise?"
1,"En 2004, les membres du groupe Bosco décident de verser dans l'électro-pop décalée. Hommage aux années 80 dans tous ce qu'elles avaient de plus ludique et décomplexée...  Hélas, on ne peut pas dire que l'entreprise soit une réussite tant ce disque exhale un parfum de prétention arty insupportable et d'un opportunisme bon teint. La preuve? Avoir pour single ""Danse sur la m##de qui passe à la radio"" tout en étant signé chez Universal! Oui, l'impertinence existe au sein de l'industrie musicale! Ouf, l'honneur est sauf pour les artistes, les vrais! Et ça c'est rien, écoutez donc le faussement provocateur ""Fils de Bourge"", grand moment d'humour musical navrant.  Au-delà de ça, le groupe enchaîne les paroles se voulant branchées et les compos sans grande consistance, lorgnant par moments du côté de Plastic Bertrand (""Un Gars Fragile"") c'est vous dire le niveau de la chose. La chanteuse des Prototypes, Bubblestar, tente de se positionner en petite fille de Lio période Banana Split, la verve en moins. Bref, un groupe qui ne porte que trop bien son nom."
4,"... ce disque est pour vous! Citer Brian Wilson et Burt Bacharach peut -à juste titre- paraître très excessif, voire outrancier. Et pourtant, il suffit d'écouter 2, 3 fois cet album pour reconnaître le don mélodique de Jim Noir. Des chansons pop au format attendu qui frappent par leur simplicité et leur justesse, privilège des plus grands.  Ici, rien de trop. Les arrangements sont impeccables, la voix sobre (et les choeurs 'Beach Boysiens') vient caresser la musique...  Pour ceux qui aiment les maîtres cités plus haut, n'hésitez pas."
1,"Déjà le nom du coffret c'est best-of et non intégrale ce qui explique le détails mais certainement pas le prix, ensuite on se fait déjà avoir en achetant les CD un à un car étrangement, des titres présents sur les 33 tours (ancêtres du CD pour les plus jeunes) disparraissent au gravage, mais en plus, cette édition ne contient même pas tous les albums (13+2 past-masters avec les morceaux effacés!)Alors mon conseil, achetez plutôt les albums un à un par ci par là et les deux past masters pour avoir une vraie intégrale, sinon contentez vous de ""l'album rouge"" puis de ""l'album bleu"" et encore du ""1"" car vu le prix de ce coffret c'est un CRIME oui un crime un vol qualifié!!!!!"
1,"J'adore Herbie Hancock dans sa période Jazz-funk (headhunters, thrust, man-child, etc...) mais là, il faut passer son chemin. On album qui a repris le concept de Santana (que l'on retrouve d'ailleurs sur 1 morceau) en invitant des stars sur chaque chanson. Un album qui aligne les stars mais qui ne présente aucun intéret. C'est mou, c'est bourgeois, il n'y a pas de créativité. J'ai même lu que Herbie Hancock a fait cet album plus pour des raisons financières que musicales. Vraiment j'adore Hancock donc je préfère oublier cet album (même si j'ai du mal à oublier ma déception)."
4,"Michel Jonasz sait décrire avec des mots de tous les jours, des mots simples et doux, le sentiment amoureux.  Parler de cette alchimie magique qui lie deux êtres et que l'on nomme AMOUR. Amour de la vie, amour de la nature, du don de son âme, amour de l'autre. Nostalgie des moments passés, restés gravés, moments heureux, souvenirs mélancoliques, mais Mémoire avant tout. Ne rien oublier, garder précieusement le moment fugitif d'où tout a commencé."
5,"Les début de lush sont plus ethérés (plus 4AD, le label), participant à la vague ""Noisy"" de ce moment, les trois premiers maxis sont épuisés aujourd'hui et cette édition américaine permet de les re-découvrir. Moins pop que les cds suivant, il reste pour moi les meilleurs morceaux et caractéristique de leur style qui les démarque des autres groupes de cette période (ride, my bloody valentine). A noter que ce cd est souvent difficile à se procurer et que son prix ici est plus abordable que dans certaines boutiques en import . Il s'agit par ailleurs d'une ré-édition, la première étant limitée et sortie chez 4AD (mais très vite épuisé car elle est un objet de collection pour les fan de V23 et Vaughan Oliver, le designer de 4AD) ."
5,"Datant de 1982, ce disque fleure bon la poussière de vocoder et d'électronique naissante. Mais pas que cela, il n'a rien perdu de son peps mélodique. Je l'avais acheté a sa sortie en K7 et tellement écouté qu'il n'y avait plus que le souffle de la bande qui se mélangeait aux sonorités étranges de ""walking&amp;Falling"" ou de ""It Tango"". Je n'ai pas écouté cet album depuis plus de dix ans et sa redécouverte me plait. Après un ""From the Air"" un peu détonnant, c'est le mystère de la narration Andersonienne qui prend le relais, avec ces petites histoires sussurées. On a retenu de cet album le cultissime ""O Superman"" à la mélodie minimaliste et efficace mais les autres morceaux sont tout aussi attirants. Un seul regret : que ce disque des années vynil ne dure que 4O petites minutes trop courtes."
5,Simple efficace. Doit faire partie de toute bonne discotheque.
4,"Ma préférée est Two-Headed Boy. C'est vrai que la voix du chanteur n'est pas habituelle, pas formatée, et ça fait du bien parfois... J'aime vraiment leur son brut avec ces guitares acoustiques saturées, certains morceaux ""décapent"" bien les enceintes !"
4,"Loin des résidus technoïdes sans âme qu'on essaye de nous faire ingurgiter de force, voici un album résolument moderne et humain portés par une chanteuse de talent. Emouvant et envoutant, un disque essentiel pour comprendre que la technologie ne doit jamais se substituer à la créativité, mais bien la servir."
2,"Je viens d'acheter le dernier disque des Boyz 2 Men, et franchement, après plusiseurs écoutes, je suis décu. On peut dire que je suis un fan des Boyz 2 Men, et ce depuis des années, mais la, je n'aime pas trop leur dernier album. Bien sur, il y a quelques belles chansons, mais d'habitude, toutes les chansons de l'album sont très bien. Je trouve qu'il manque ce petit plus qui a fait la force de leurs albums précédents, tant dans les slows que dans les chansons R&amp;b. Avant, les slows nous emportaient, j'en avait meme des frissons, alors que la, plus d'effet. A vous de faire le choix maintenant, si vous voulez quelques belles chansons achetez, mais si vous voulez des chansons des Boyz 2 Men, achetez plutot ""Cooleyhighharmony"", ""II"" ou ""Evolution""."
2,"on attendait ts cet album pr voir si Mariah Carey ,celle qui se dit etre une gde voix ,une gde star faire ses preuves...apres l'échec ENORME de glitter qui est a mon gout bien mérité ,ns revoilà avec un album qui marque le retour de la diva ..moi qui apprecie le talent de mariah ,je dois vs dire que je commence a douter de son talent ...cet album est trés trés molasson ,pas une musique qui vs reveille et la voix de mariah?? disparu ...que du ""sussurage"" tt au long de cet album ...seul ""through the rain"" et ""my saving grace"" st chantés a pleine voix..cet album est ni hip hop ,si rnb ,ni ballade ,on s'y perd et s'en lasse trés facilement..Mariah Carey ne fait qu'approfondir le fossé qui s'est creusé entre elle et LES VRAIES DIVAS comme LA grande Céline Dion,Tina Arena,ou meme Shania Twain."
5,"Ah, le grand disque que voilà ! Honnêtement, j'ai été bluffé. Et pourtant, la chanson française actuelle me laisse de marbre. Mais là, quel douceur dans la voix, quelle sobriété dans la production et les arrangements ... Nullement mièvre, cet album se déguste comme un assortiment de pralines. Au diable les préjugés, vous ne trouverez pas ici un quelconque plan marketing. Simplement une artiste,une vraie, qui sait écrire et possède un joli filet de voix. Après quoi, vous passerez faire un tour dans l'univers non moins sublime de Keren Ann. Les deux vont vous émerveiller."
4,"Pour un premier album, il s'agit d'un tour de force. Les textes sont excellents et les mélodies superbes. On entre ici dans un univers chaleureux et agréable, le tout orchestré par la voix sensuelle et très légèrement cassée de Carla Bruni. Comme si elle ne chantait rien que pour nous... Pas étonnant que cet album caracole en tête des ventes tant il est à la fois décalé et intemporel. Un pur moment de détente à ne louper sous aucun prétexte."
5,"Ce n'est à la base pas mon univers mais bon sang quelle claque. Cette voix qui reste posée d'une phrase à l'autre. La participation de Chris Cornell est à signaler; comme sur les autres Am. rec. Cash s'entoure avec soin. Et puis après tout les mots sont peu de chose face aux magnifiques 'Spiritual"" et ""Southern accents"". Bon sang..."
2,"Je l'attendais ce nouveau No One... Dieu sait que je l'attendais. Et pourtant, dès la première écoute, c'est plus ou moins le drame. La déception est là, inéluctable, et les premières questions surgissent ? Dont l'une, la plus frappante : « Mais où est passé le No One d'antan ? ». Ce No One qui, la rage au ventre, balançait l'un des albums les plus chauds du rock Français avec « Utopia », ce No One revendicateur qui riffait comme un beau diable et éructait ses slogans fédérateurs.... Perdu dans ce remodelage du groupe autour du seul membre d'origine, Marc Gulbenkian, voilà où est passé ce No One. Et que nous reste-t-il au final? Un ersatz du No One d'antan. Un ersatz gonflé de rythmiques dansantes pas toujours du meilleur goût pour qui repense aux « Chile » et autres « Nomenklatura ». Alors certes, il reste ces textes toujours bien sentis, ces quelques titres qui surnagent (« Us festival », « Revolution.com », « Où étions-nous ? ») et le plaisir de retrouver le timbre de voix de Gulbenkian. Mais surnage tout de même cette dérangeante sensation d'opportunisme afin de capitaliser sur « un nom » après l'échec commercial de « Prénom betty », l'album solo de Gulbenkian. Parce qu'il faut bien l'admettre, ce No One n'est pas le notre, ou du moins pas celui si cher à mon cœur. « Revolution.com, comme ça manque de sueur » ? Je n'aurais pas dit mieux."
5,"Merci pour cette version remasterisée. Un grand moment de pouvoir écouter avec un son retravaillé les titres comme "" rivers of babylon "", "" brown girl in the ring "" etc... Le cadeau pour cette nouvelle édition, on nous offre la version intégrale de "" mary's boy child/oh my lord "" en 5'50s. Ce titre ne faisait pas parti de la playlist de l'édition d'époque. Une version totalement inédite sur cd car dans les récente compilation du groupe la durée de ce titre n'est proposé seulement que pour 4'30s ou moins. Super album."
5,"Ca y est, il est de retour notre cher Francis Cabrel ! Avec de lavance, même  Je napprendrai rien à ses plus grands fans en vous disant que F. Cabrel sait poser à merveille des mélodies riches (ici mâtinées de rythmes méditerranéens) sur des textes quon dirait taillés pour elles. Une Argutie  pour vanter les mérites de cet album serait donc vaine. Il est pourtant rapporté par certains que cette fois les chansons sont outrageusement engagées. Je leur répondrais que ce nest pas le premier album engagé de lartiste (souvenez-vous de Saïd et Mohamed ou de Cent ans de plus par exemple) et que même si elles sont de fait plus nombreuses dans cet album, elles sont dabord sûrement justifiées par un contexte social fort inquiétant, et en tout état de cause, construites avec finesse et habileté, à limage de « laquarelliste » , pour reprendre les termes de lartiste lui-même, posant sur sa toile ce qui lui est donné de voir par touches légères. En outre, F. Cabrel, dans une chanson aussi délicieusement assassine que Des gens formidables, laisse place à lespoir : « On dirait des choses essentielles / Et de toute beauté / Comme on serait né avec des ailes / Ca serait pas compliqué ». Un paradoxe finalement naturel quand il sagit de la race humaine, à limage du titre qui a donné son nom à lalbum : Des roses et des orties."
2,"Ce disque serait l'oeuvre d'un p'tit nouveau, j'aurais dit ""pas mal foutu"" mais venant d'une icône de la chanson Française j'ai envie d'être plus sévère. Ok, les textes sont parfois assez percutants et certains d'entre eux comme ""Les faussaires"" sont vraiment tres efficaces. En revanche les mélodies, les arrangements, ont été entendues mille fois (sur des albums du même auteur ou autres J.Brown...) et je veux bien parier que ce CD ne sera bientôt plus diffusé que par RFM et Nostalgie, radios stars de la rengaine. Les adeptes de ce genre de variété seront forcément comblés, mais pour moi faire du ""sous Dire-Straits"" à notre époque ce n'est quand même pas tres novateur, voire même un peu fatigant..."
1,"c le moin qu'on puisse dire non le gros ""hic"" ici c la musique derrière....d'une extrême pauvreté"
5,je trouve lorie genial c'est terrible elle est hyper dynamique tout ce qu'il faut j'aimerais faire comme elle plus tard
1,"cet album est comme celui de la petite préscilia qui a 12 ans, seulement lorie a 21 ans il serait temps de changer de disque, avoir la même musique est les mêmes chorégraphie (voir la même mentalité) qu'une fille de 12 ans c'est pas terrible(et encore pr chante mieux), les chansons nian nian a déconseillées vivement comme le dit mon prédécéseur même pour les 10-12 ans."
1,"Quand on ecoute cet album on ce demande vraiment dans quellle société on vit. Le pire week end de ma vie: ma niece est arrivée avec un album d'alizée et une autre de lorie....et le fais qu'elle soit de ma famille n'excuse rien. Bon je ne l'ai pas executé sur place car sa mere (a ma niece pas a alizée) m'en aurrais voulut mais elle l'aurasi sans doute merité. PITOYABLE doit etre le mot qui convient pour decrir convenablement cet album formatter et purement commercial. La seul chose qui soit vrai c'est que cette ""chanteuse"" est vraiment mignonne (mais bon ca ne suffit pas a faire un cd de qualité: la preuve cette ""Gourmandise"" surement aussi delicieuse que le kloug du ""pere noel est une ordure"")."
1,"La ""musique"" est nulle ,les textes sont pitoyables.Un exemple pour rire un bon coup: J'ai dans le coeur comme un poids Dans la gorge une epine De n'avoir fait le choix ""LUI"" ou ""TOI"" Les fenetres sont en bois (Il devait manquer une rime...) Bref, de la soupe ,de la ""musique"" banale et sans originalité. Mais bon,il faut bien de la musique pour les ascenseurs et les supermarchés!"
5,Quelle joie d'entendre cette album encore plus magnifique que les precedants. Bravo pour ces superbes duo mon préférer est celui avec brain molko qui était attendu depuis si longtemps. G hate d'aller les voir sur scène en mars. En encore un grand bravo pour se magnifique double album
1,"Une chose est sûre: cela ne ressemble en rien à ce que Jean-Michel Jarre a fait dans le passé. Cet album devrait s'appeler ""Musique Pour Ascenseurs"". On dirait Air en beaucoup plus mauvais. Emotion zero. Créativité zero. Froid et ennuyeux. On est loin de ""Zoolook"" et des ""Chants Magnétiques"". Depuis ""Chronologie"", quelle déception de voir JMJ en has-been complet. ""Oxygene 7-13"" aurait pu être une porte de sortie, mais on sent bien depuis cela l'artiste qui cherche à revenir dans le coup en faisant la même chose que les autres (...) ""Tokyo Kid"", ""Moon Machine"", ""Arpégiateur"", ""Diva"", ""Oxygène II"", ""Ethnicolor"", ... Difficile de penser que ce soit la même personne qui puisse nous pondre un album comme ""Geometry Of Love"". (...)"
2,"C'est la première fois que je suis vraiment déçu par un album de Jarre. Jusque là, j'avais tout aimé, et en particulier le fabuleux ""Métamorphoses"", plein de vie, de chaleur, parfois un rien déroutant dans sa façon de sonner. Ce nouvel album, ""Sessions 2000"", est à l'opposé du précédent : aucune mélodie, des rythmes plats, un air de ""déjà vu"" dans les arrangements, des sonorités échantilonnées à n'en plus finir (trompette, guitare, basse). Le tout donne une impression d'ennui intenable."
5,"je voudrais dire à tout les internautes d'acheter cet album, il ne faut pas hésiter, car victoria est une vrai chanteuse. Moi je la suit depuis ses débuts avec ""le désir de chanter"" et je trouve qu'elle en a bavé pour se faire un nom dans la chanson, car son album a mis du temps à sortir mais c'est enfin chose faite, et il ne faudrait pas que cet album soit un échec car Victoria serait triste et nous n'aurions plus la chance de revoir un autre de ses albums. Achetez-le vous ne regretterez rien !"
1,"Aaaaah , le dernier CD de Saez...Fan du premier, c'est avec impatience que j'attendais son arrivé sur le marché."
5,"Probablement le meilleur album de Laura Pausini. La musique est superbe et entrainante. Des titres cultes comme ""Gente"" et ""lui non sta con te"" et d'autres à écouter et réécouter même s'ils sont moins connus, ""Cani e gatti"" et ""Anni miei"". Un best of à lui tout seul, une pure merveille..."
2,"Que dire, à part que c'est une grande déception, fini le mélange subtil de rock gothique symphonique associé à la voix puissante et vibrante de Tarja. Un groupe qui sortait du lot... Je n'ai rien contre la nouvelle chanteuse Anette, mais je trouve qu'elle est bien trop ""ordinaire"", et désolé de ma franchise, au risque d'en froisser certains..., certes les compositions de Tuomas sont toujours aussi bonnes et bien travaillées, mais ça ne prend pas..., cette nouvelle formation manque peut-être encore d'une âme, et dommage, car je n'ai pas eu l'occasion de voir l'ancienne formation en concert..., ce n'est donc pas cette année que j'aurai envie de les voir... Pour conclure, je dirai que ce nouvel album est relativement agréable à écouter, il bénéficie d'un bon effet de marketing et attirera plutôt de nouveaux fans du genre et risque de décevoir bien des fans ayant apprécié leurs précédents albums..."
2,"Autant je considère Andre Matos comme une sorte de génie, qui au sein d'Angra a su revitaliser le heavy mélodique en y insufflant du classique (composé par lui, attention!), du Brésil, de l'inspiration... enfin, sa patte, quoi. Mais alors entre Shaman et ce ""Time To Be Free"", je dis STOP ! La recette 1000 fois éprouvée qu'untilise Matos sur ce disque n'est pas révisitée du tout, même s'il chante plus haut et ça joue plus vite que jamais. Le résultat est d'une platitude convenue - mais le contraire m'aurait étonné, malheureusement - et ne parvient pas à décoller depuis la 1ère jusqu'à la dernière note. Ca démarre en trombe, double grosse caisse au taquet, claviers en folie et chant altier, et ça finit de la même manière, sans que jamais un seul frisson ne nous ait parcouru l'échine, pourtant préparée à vibrer lors de la découverte de la dernière oeuvre d'un grand bonhomme du métal. Bref, on est hyper loin de tout ce que Matos sait faire de bon et fin. A oublier vitre vite vite..."
1,"J'étais motivé quand j'ai écouté les premiers sons mais au bout de quelque minutes je me suis dit ""Tiens ca me rappelle quelque chose ça !"", ""et ça aussi"" et ça c'est ..."" En fait j'ai déjà dans ma discothéque les originaux des albums qui ont été sauvagement pillés pour faire ce disque. J'aime beaucoup les goûts musicaux des musiciens d'absolute, dommage qu'ils aient autant de mal à se dégager de leurs influences. Des jeunes gens fougeux et fort influencables somme toute !!! Acheter les originaux plutôt. Achetez plutôt un disque de Fishbone un autre de Faith no more, un bon Wu Tang, deux trois sons techno et voila !"
5,"Tout d'abord, le packaging est très bien fait. Ce disque se présente en forme de digipack +livret, avec un petit avertissement USBM à l'arrière(parodie du FBI Warning contre le piratage et indice surement au jeu de piste Year Zero) Les photos du digipack sont imprimée sur du papier qualité photo, donc très bonne qualité d'impression. Le CD quand à lui, le support en lui même, réserve une petite surprise pour quiconque l'écoute. Après le support matériel, le son en lui même : cet album est très bon, au niveau production, le son ressemble sensiblement à celui de With Teeth, sans pour autant que la musique soit du même style. Rien que l'introduction Hyperpower vous donnera une bonne idée de la tonalité du CD. Par moments énervés, par moments plus calmes, les chansons de cet album de toutes des bombes. Après un With Teeth qui reçut un accueil mitigé, bien que très bon album, Year Zero peut être considéré comme le retour en force de Nine Inch Nails, et pour longtemps."
4,"Incroyable! Je viens de découvrir tristania et cet album ""world of glass"". Un chant proche de Sharon Den Adel de Within Temptation tout en étant meilleur!! Des vocaux death à la Mark Jansen d'Epica (ex-After Forever)!! Des choeurs grandiloquents!! Les riffs sont superbes et aucune chanson ne se répète par rapport à une autre. Bref,un très bon album. Les fans de Nightwish,After Forever et Within Temptation apprécieront. On regrettera que le co-fondateur gratteux se soit barré."
5,"he oui faut ce faire a l idee que les beastie boys sont le groupe de rap le plus en avance sur leur temps,pour chaque nouvelle album on peut se demander pourquoi ils triturent leurs musiques de cette facon mais apres on peut observer que beaucoup de groupe prennent la direction adoptee par ce groupe.Pour Pauls boutique,on doit etre en presence d un des album le plus joue,il n y a pas que du sample ou du beat lourd mais beaucoup d instrument.Unanimement casse par la critique a sa sortie,cette album est devenu ,au fil du temps,un classique incontournable du rap...A POSSEDER........................PEACE"
1,"Elle a osé sortir une compil' de ses pires horreurs! C'est sur que ça n'a pas du etre facile de choisir parmi la tonne de gravas,chercher le pire du pire, trier dans les déchets,mettre les mains dans sa propre déjection, trop classe!!! Mais cette souillon est capable de tout, sauf de bon gout !! cette chose est une horreur absolue,une innommable abjection,une certaine idée de l'enfer!!! triple zéro pointé!!!!!"
5,"La merveilleuse diva quebecoise est revenue , apres avoir consacre 2 ans a son enfant et mari . Ce disque reflete une chaleur humaine ,une voix somptueuse et une composition speciale et touchante ."
5,"La nouvelle légende du hip-hop sort enfin un album disponible dans le commerce ! Et quel album !! Aux manettes de Dr Dre et de Eminem, 50 cent sort tout droit de New York et fait du très lourd, notamment avec les titres « Wat up gangsta », ou encore « Patiently waiting » avec Eminem. Je ne parle pas des hits en puissance « In da club » et « 21 questions » en featuring avec Nate dogg. Les bonus tracks sont de grandes qualités, avec un titre déjà présent sur la bande originale du film 8 mile « Wanksta », le puissant « U not like me » et le « diss » dressé à Ja rule : « Life’s on  the line ». C’EST DU TRES BON SON !"
5,"Michaël vient encore de prouver par cet album tout son savoir-faire. C'est un chef d'oeuvre qui ne peut émaner que d'un MICHAEL et qui est à la hauteur de son immense talent. C'est un mythe et pour longtemps encore, il occupera la première marche du podium.  MICHAEL a remis les pendules à l'heure. Le message que divulgue ""INVINCIBLE"" est très clair : ""I'M THE BEST"". Pour une dernière, elle est toute réussie. ""El fenomeno"", entendons le phénomène, reste égal à lui-même."
5,"Attention à la bêtise : alors jugez vous-même! Cet album est celui d'un artiste brillant, intelligent, qui connait son sujet et sait s'entourer...Techniquement aucun album autour de nous n'a un son aussi sublime, varié, riche... Pas simple à écouter mais déjà un classique indépassable... Son meilleur album, enfin! Fin des enfantillages, un album d'amour, de joie, de résurrection, une puissante musique du corps. Ite missa est..."
4,"Jill Scott nous offre un très bon album de soul qui n'est pas sans rappeler Erykah Badu,et même Mary J. Blige par moments.Malgré quelques titres un peu hésitants,nous attendons impatiemment Jill Scott vol.2."
5,"Mon commenaire sur le I vaut aussi pour le II, mais j'ajouterai que celui-ci est plus doux et aussi plus stonien dans ses moments rock. 14 Years d'Izzy Stradlin est le morceau ultime dans ce genre. Estranged est la plus belle ballade d'Axl. Quant à Get In The Ring, c'est toujours un bonheur à entendre."
5,"Christopher Cross fait très fort avec ce premier album aux nombreuses récompenses - pour une fois justifiées. Tout est bon, cet album est en quelque sorte l'album de référence de la musique dite californienne.Achetez aussi l'album rendez-vous, son live ( en CD ou en DVD), Avalon et son best of. Sa discographie mérite d'être visitée, tout est bon.Il est également un remarquable guitariste en plus d'être un chanteur à voix typée. A écouter en été, le soir, avec un bon verre..."
4,"Un tres bon album de Rick Springfield malheureusement peu connu en France. Quelques sonorités de synthé ont un peu vieillies mais dans l'ensemble, la couleur Rock FM de l'album est plutôt agréable à l'oreille. Une mention particulière pour Me &amp; Johnny, superbe chanson a l'extraordinaire guitare rythmique. Un album qui s'écoute trop vite finallement. A acheter les yeux fermés pour tous les fans de Rock Americain et de chanteur style Brian Adams et autres Richard Marx"
1,le problème avec ce genre de personnes c que cela passe + pour un produit que pour un vrai artiste..album pas très concluant à mon humble avis
2,"Pourquoi diable être allé chercher Zazie pour écrire 6 morceau dans cet album ? Zazie, la chanteuse qui prétrend qu'elle écrit des chansons pour les gondoles de supermarchés... Heureusement il y a un titre sympa de Burgalat (qui néamnmoins ne s'est pas foulé)... Notre Christophe autrefois adoré balade désormais un spleen tout à fait visible sur les plateaux télé... comme si il était conscient de cet échec. on attendait peut être trop de ce Christophe auréolé de ses magnifiques reprises dans la nouvelle star. Dommage..."
5,"Je ne suis pas un fan de MF, mais j'aime bien. C'est tout. J'ai achété ce DVD par curiosité, après avoir vu le clip live ""Avant que l'ombre"". Je suis vraiment tombé sous le charme. Le spectacle est magnifique, très bien construit (alternance de scènes) et réalisé. Mylène est parfaite, parfois émouvante, parfois espiègle. Vocalement en pleine forme (mais comment fait-elle pour chanter plus de 2 heures avec une voix si ""fragile"" ?). La mise en images du concert est, à mon avis, parfaite ; l'ambiance du spectable est très bien rendue, sans trop d'effet superflus. Les chansons sont très bien choisis : de vieux ""tubes"", plusieurs titres du dernier album (bien meilleurs en live !), jusqu'au mytique ""Deshabillez-moi"" ! Lorsque les portes se referment, on a les larmes aux yeux comme le public, et on n'a qu'une envie.... remettre le DVD ! Sûr que ce DVD fera de superbes cadeaux sous l'arbre de Noël."
2,"Je suis un fan de Mylene Farmer et j'ai acheté le dvd avec curiosite'. J'avais hate de voir Mylene en concert et ses nouvelles coreographies. La premiere chose que j'ai remarque' a etait la boite collecteur du dvd que c'est vraiment pas pratique a gerer et pas tres jolie. Je suis retourne' au magasin pour l'exchanger avec l'edition normale (la pochette n'est pas terrible non plus). Je pense que Mylene est un grande artiste et c'est vraiment dommage que le film de son derniere concert n'est pas a l'hauteur du spectacle live que a l'air tres soigne' et interessante. Malheuresement le tournage du concert et SURTOUT le montage du film est désastreux (pour moi). A l'exception de deux chanson ou on peux voir avec plaisir la performance de Mylene ('Rever' et 'Avant Que L'Ombre...') pendant tout le reste du film le realisateur a choisi de: 1) montrer de gros plans de la salle a Bercy avec beaucoup de zooming sur le public, 2)couper chaque sequence ou il y Mylene qui chante pour un maximum de 1 ou 2 secondes, toujours pour retourner et montrer le public...(?)   Moi, j'avais envie de voir Mylene chanter: elle est tres belle et sympa sur scene. On n'as pas le temps de savourer sa personalite' sur scene parce que sa performance est coupe' tout le temps, sans arret, avec des images que ont aucun interet! (toujours les gros plans zomme' sur la salle du concert, les memes tetes des fans en premiere ligne). On se demande si le film a etait realise' express pour le hard-core fans en premiere rang a Bercy... J'espere que le realisateur du film peux lire ma critique a son travail, si non j'espere que les fans qui sont d'accord avec moi pouvent lui envoyer ce commentaire. Je suis d'accord avec Skippy: dommage pour une belle occasion (rate') pour faire un beau film. Et les bonus..? Rien de interessante, le cameramans aurait mieux fait d'aller filmer le 'jardin de Vienne'..."
1,"ôtez-lui les fantasmes sexuels, une évidente volonté de provocation (mais pas trop tout de même), un sens évident du marketing,un don tout aussi évident pour la mise en scène d'elle-même et de ses clips. Mélangez cela à de l'électronique (beaucoup) pour cacher une évidente absence de voix, mêlez-y quelques références littéraires (Poe notamment). Que vous reste-t-il ? Le système Farmer c'est cela. Alors oui, parfois elle se surpasse et parvient à avoir des textes moins médiocres, et des mélodies passables, mais sincèrement elle gère bien son ""bizness"" la bougre, pour durer autant avec si peu."
5,"Bon, les premières choses dîtes en entendant cet album ont été ""C'est trop bon, j'ai un orgasme musical"". Je me suis fais un véritable plaisir en écoutant cet album et ça recommence à chaque fois que je le remet. Essayez et laissez-vous aller."
2,"Ce disque est assez médiocre: les sons sont mauvais et répétitifs, sans originalité. Les invités sont des chanteuses/ Chanteurs de rnb énérvants. Heuresement, quelques titres viennet sauver la mise, comme The Rain ou Sock it to me. Un CD que l'on oublie vite..."
5,"le meilleur album de trash? Sans doute, les 2 seuls qui puissent lui faire concurrence sont ""reign in blood"" et ""master of puppets"". C'est tout dire!"
5,"Je voudrais simplement dire que, pour moi, c'est le meilleur album de Faith Hill. A écouter d'urgence !"
2,"excellent, paroles nauséabondes, musique allumée, son extra, Mother Tongue ne vendra pas beaucoup en France, et c'est tant mieux. Ce groupe est réservé à une petite élite, pour les autres y a Queen et Police..."
5,"Ce trio vocal, composé à l'origine de Cecil ""Skeleton"" Spence, Albert ""Apple"" Craig, Lascelles ""Wiss"" Bulgin, a représenté un des meilleurs groupes de ""Roots Reggae"". Les 3 membres se sont rencontrés dans un établissement soignant les personnes atteintes de la poliomyélite. Sur scéne, ils se présentent avec des béquilles ! Cet album est le premier d'une longue série et certainement le meilleur et le plus inspiré. Il est paru à la fin des années 70. Chaque membre du groupe compose des chansons et les chante, ce qui n'est pas courant dans les trios vocaux. Tous les morceaux, dont les thèmes sont trés liés à la  philosophie rasta, peuvent être considérés comme des classiques. On peut retenir ""Why Worry"" qui exhorte les rastas à ne pas se tracasser puisqu'ils peuvent prier Jah, ""Lift Up Your Conscience"", ""Weep &amp; Mourn"". C'est le top des musiciens jamaïcains de l'époque qui accompagne le trio. Augustus Pablo aux claviers ! Vous l'avez compris cet album doit figurer en bonne place dans toute ""discothèque"" reggae !!!"
1,"J'ai rarement entendu un disque aussi incipide. Aucune bonne chanson à mon gout, du bruit et des invités pour masquer un manque d'inspiration flagrant. Max pioche dans tous les répertoires pour accoucher au final d'un patchwork indigeste et complétement raté. J'adore Sepultura et les autres albums de Soulfly mais là vraiment c'est minable. Les morceaux sont ennuyeux, et encore je reste poli, le son trés moyen et l'inspiration aux abonnés absents. Un album dont on aurait jamais entendu parler, et pour cause, si Max Cavalera n'en avait été le triste auteur. D'ailleurs en parlant d'auteur les paroles atteignent un degré de miévrerie difficilement égalable, décidément le seul domaine où Max ait placé la barre haute. A éviter absolument."
4,"Ce cd est très bien mais il ne vaut pas celui appelé ""sublime"", du groupe eponyme. Cependant, comme ceci est leur premier album, on peut dire qu'ils se sont quand meme pas mal debrouillés, ces 3 p'tits americains !!!! Il y a des chansons qui sont franchement excellentes, telles que ""40 oz to freedom"", ""5446 that's my number/ball and chain"", ""djs"", ou bien encore ""date rape"", sans oublier la reprise de ""rivers of babylon"". Dans le genre ska punk, c'est à posséder, cependant je ne met que 4 étoiles comparé a leur autre album."
5,"Le premier album d'anti-flag, des super lyrics, à acheter sans réfléchir.. Bien que le son pour les paroles ne soit pas forcément très bon, c'est un excellent album.. A écouter aussi, A New Kind Of Army, The Terror State, Mobilize, Underground Network."
1,"Tout ce qui faisait le charme des red hot a disparu...tout comme son prédécesseur, By the way ne groove pas, n'a pas de rythme, s'enlise dans des balades interminables. Bref la magie présente dans des disques comme blood sugar sex magic, mother's milk, ou encore one hot minute (la guitare endiablé de dave navarro manque vraiment) a totalement disparu. Les red hot confirment donc leur tendance à faire de la pop banale, voire de la variété, et à rentrer dans le commercial.  J'étais à leur concert à Lyon en juin et c'était pitoyable."
2,"Je me suis intéressé à cet album d'une part parce qu'il est cité par mon groupe favoris (Radiohead) comme un des albums qui les a le plus influencés et d'autre part parceque les chroniques que j'ai pu lire dessus ainsi que le nombre de fois où j'ai vu cet album être cité en bon terme m'ont donner envie de l'écouter. J'ai acheté cet album en 2001 et je l'ai redécouvert pas plus tard que ce matin. Et bien, mon impression n'a pas changé. Mes goûts se sont pourtant pas mal élargies depuis 2001 et malgré-tout, je n'apprécie toujours pas cet album. Ce qui est sûr c'est que les influences africaines et la présence du RYTHME est bel et bien là. Mais un peu trop selon moi. Les trois premières chansons sont, à mon avis, plutôt faites pour danser, et sont clairement trop longues, surtout la troisième. Peut-être que certaines personnes peuvent ""rentrer en trance"" sur ce morceau mais moi ça m'ennuie. Il n'y à qu'à partir du 4ème morceau que ça devient un peu plus intéressant. Les sons et petites trouvailles mélodiques de ce ""Once in a lifetime"" le rendent inévitablement plus agréable que les trois premiers morceaux. ""Houses in motion"" est aussi chiante que les trois premiers morceaux. ""Seen and not seen"" en revanche relève d'un autre niveau. C'est le morceau que je préfère de l'album. La touche sonore de Brian Eno le rend particulièrement intéressant. ""Listening wind"" est trés intéressante au niveau du rythme mais ce rapproche pour moi des morceaux chiants du début.  ""The Overload"" nous plonge dans un autre registre. Il n'est plus question de rythme ou de danse ici. C'est un titre plus méditatif. Ce morceaux est intéressant au niveau du son. Pour la petite anecdote, ce morceau à été composé alors que le groupe avait entendu parlé de ""Joy Division"". N'ayant pourtant jamais entendu une seule chanson de Joy Division, ils ont tentés de faire un morceau rappelant Joy Division simplement au travers de de la description qu'on leur avaient donnés et de l'idée qu'il s'en étaient fait. Personnellement je dirais que c'est réussi au niveau du chant de David BYRNE (qui peut effectivement rappeler celui d'Ian CURTIS)et de l'atmosphère froide du morceau... Mais pour ce qui est du son... Joy Division c'est quand-même plus rock. Je me suis rendu compte en réécoutant cet album que ce qui me déplait le moins dans cet album c'est plutôt les sons, hors, qui c'est principalement occupé de tout celà ? ... Brian Eno. Alors je dirais pour ma part qu'il y'a ici trop de Talking heads et pas assez de Brian Eno... Mais je peux m'tromper. Il faudrait sans doute que j'écoute ""My life in the bush of ghosts"" de Brian Eno pour savoir si mon impression se confirme. En tout cas, j'ai écouté ""Talking heads : 77"" qui est nettement plus basique et où Brian Eno n'est pas présent et je n'aime pas cet album non plus (à part ""Psycho Killer"")."
5,"""Invasion ..."" me parait avoir mieux vieilli que son prédécesseur . Surtout , Warren De Martini ""on the rocks"" (oui je sais ! elle est facile) éclabousse de tout son talent un disque , certe un peu court , mais jouissif d'un bout à l'autre . Aujourd'hui encore sa production reste probante , et les morceaux qui y figurent demeurent aussi de qualités supérieurs à ceux d'""Out of the cellar"" (cela n'engage que moi) .  Un remarquable album de ce milieu des années 80 , pour qui serait sensible à ce type de Hard rock , et dont la bande FM Américaine se faisait si souvent l'écho . 18,5/20"
1,"L'album de la trahison, L'album de la compromission, L'album des cheveux coupés, L'album de la main tendu aux pognons et au ""Music business"", L'album qui signe la disparition du plus grand groupe de Thrash de L'histoire."

2,"Désolé mais là non! Les deux autres ablums de Eminem et sa production avec D12 était tellment géniales qu'on attendait mieux (trop?). En tous cas cette album est trés décevant en dehors de quelques bombes tels ""whithout me"" qui prouve que Slim Shady a encore la rage."
5,"Alors que musicalement, Bon Jovi n'avait guère convaincu avec son deuxième album, Jon et Richie composent 35 titres, dont dix finiront sur SWW. Dix petites bombes qui marqueront la musique rock. Après le heavy ""Let It Rock"" qui se place plutôt vers ""7800° Farhenheit"", tous les autres morceaux marquent une flagrante évolution. Un peu plus de claviers, des refrains ultra-accrocheurs, une production plus propre pour la radio et MTV... D'où l'émergence de deux singles-phares, ""You Give Love A Bad Name"" et ""Livin' On A Prayer"", tous deux composés avec Desmond Child, hit maker de renom qui avait travaillé pour Kiss, Bonnie Tyler, Aerosmith... En binome, les morceaux imparables sont quand même présents, et se suffisent sans l'apport de ce gourou du songwriting. Deux autres très gros singles, le très apprécié ""Wanted Dead Or Alive"" (qui était le titre de travail de l'album), puis ""Never Say Goodbye"", un morceau que le groupe ne comptait même pas utiliser et que des fans ont préféré voir sur le disque plutôt que le titre retenu à l'époque des répétitions. On peut regretter l'absence de deux inédits qui ont circulé sur des faces B :""Borderline"", une chanson colossalle au refrain époustouflant, et le moyen ""Edge Of A Broken Heart"". Un disque exceptionnel pour un groupe qui creva le plafond des charts à l'époque avec (en 1995, SWW s'était vendu à 12 millions de copies aux USA!)"
5,"Junior Kimbrough en voilà un nom qui sonne fort pour le monde du Blues. En effet, il faut savoir que Junior est au blues ce que Mozart est au classique : un inventeur ! Certes, au début de sa carrière, il a jouer le même genre et dans des normes blues de grand bluesmen contemporain de son époque, dont je pense en premier lieu,   et  , dans les même jukes et les clubs que l'ami de longue date et rival  . Par la suite, l'approche artistique et musical de Junior se fait radicalement différente puisant dans un Blues profondément ancrée dans les flux du Delta...  l'approche de son Mississippi Blues est si énormément différente de n'importe quoi ce qui l'a précédé qu'il se classe parmi les trois bluesmen les plus grands d'entre tous :  ,   et  . Junior devient un créateur tirant certes parti de la tradition mais en créant un style au son parfait ré imaginant le blues. S'entourant d'un blues band talentueux, dont on trouve Kenny Malone à la batterie, Gary Burnside à la basse et Kenny Brown pour la guitare. Junior Kimbrough saura obtenir le meilleur d'eux pour parfaire son style dont   et   en sont les parfait exemple. L'album présent se trouve être son dernier, sorti tout juste après sa mort. Le son est à la fois dure et lent, vibrant sur un tempo prolongé de notes puissantes caractérisant bien le Blues du Sud. A cela, il faut ajouter la superbe plume de Junior. Le 17 Janvier 1998, Kimbrough est retrouver mort sur son lit, victime d'un arrêt cardiaque comme  . Il avait 67 ans... ce dernier album est réellement magnifique et le label Fat Possum peut pleurer un autre géant qui le quitte après R.L Burnside,  , Paul 'Wine' Jones... Junior Kimbrough peut reposer en paix ! Durée : 36 minutes - 8Titres."
5,""" Ce groupe a plus de bons riffs sur un single moyen que Black Sabbath sur ses quatres premiers albums ""."
5,Cet album est un fabuleux concept album sur l'ecologie.Un monument de metal progressif sombre technique et emotionnel.Que dire d'un album aussi riche et varie si ce n'est qu'il est à posseder impérativement pour ne pas mourir idiot.A écouter en entier et très fort.
5,"Et Muse nous offre un album fort, vibrant, qui prend aux tripes par sa puissance(time is running out,...), mais aussi par sa profondeur(ruled by secrecy, endlessly, absolution,...)...Que ce soit à l'aide de la guitare ou du piano(qui donne des accents lyriques indéniables et vibrants), Matthew Bellamy et sa bande de ""muse-iciens"" tiennent ici, sans nul doute, à mon goût, leur meilleur album...A écouter absolument!!!"
5,"Au panthéon des batteurs de Jazz, il convient d'installer au sommet Elvin Jones dont on pourra apprécier le jeu polyrythmique sur les innombrables albums enregistrés par John Coltrane et, juste à sa droite, l'immense Tony Williams qui a redéfini le rôle des tambours dans l'orchestre de jazz (à écouter sur les disques du second quintet de Miles Davis). Mais après ces deux légendes, le troisième homme qui vient tout de suite à l'esprit est Roy Haynes, né à Boston en 1925, qui a traversé les époques et les genres en adaptant constamment son style expressif aux exigences du moment. On peut ainsi l'écouter sur une multitude de disques - il fut l'un des batteurs les plus enregistrés de l'histoire du jazz - et dans des contextes forts différents aux côtés de Sarah Vaughan (In the Land of Hi-Fi, 1955), de Rahsaan Roland Kirk (Domino, 1962) ou d'Andrew Hill (Black Fire, 1963) sans parler de quelques albums parmi les plus mythiques du jazz comme The Blues And The Abstract Truth (1961) d'Oliver Nelson, Newport '63 de John Coltrane (avec une fabuleuse version de My Favorite Things), Now He Sings, Now He Sobs (1968) de Chick Corea en trio avec Miroslav Vitous, Question and Answer (1989) de Pat Metheny avec Dave Holland et Like Minds (1998) en quartet avec Metheny, Holland et Corea. Aujourd'hui, alors que Roy Haynes est toujours en activité à l'âge de 82 ans, le label Dreyfus sort une coffret de trois CD qui couvre en 37 titres l'étonnante carrière du batteur à travers 50 années d'histoire. Le premier disque, consacré à la période 1949 - 1962, comprend des classiques enregistrés en compagnie de grands maîtres du swing et du be-bop comme Lester Young, Bud Powell, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Sonny Rollins, Sarah Vaughan, Stan Getz ou Thelonious Monk. Le second, qui s'étend de 1962 à 1998, le voit collaborer à des musiques plus modernes ou contemporaines en compagnie d'artistes comme Jackie MacLean, John et Alice Coltrane, Chick Corea et Pat Metheny sans oublier sa contribution à la rencontre inoubliable entre Stephane Grappelli et Michel Petrucciani (Flamingo, 1996). Enfin, le troisième compact, qui rompt avec l'approche chronologique, présente des enregistrements réalisés en leader. En plus, le coffret contient un livret réalisé par l'historien Ashley Kahn et offre en bonus un DVD avec une interview exclusive et deux extraits de concert datant de 2005 et 1973. Bien sûr, cette compilation concoctée par le label Dreyfus ne fait qu'effleurer la surface d'une oeuvre riche et abondante mais elle a l'avantage de mettre en exergue, comme aucun disque ne l'a fait auparavant, la contribution essentielle de Roy Haynes a l'évolution de la batterie. On en vient à regretter qu'il n'y ait pas plus de rétrospectives aussi intelligentes et soignées que celle-ci sur les grands hommes qui ont fait l'histoire du jazz. Recommandé !"
5,"Tout simplement indispensable !!! Rien a jeter, tout est parfait meme si James avait encore qq petit souci avec ca voie (il etait encore jeune le bougre) On en profitera pour savourer une derniere fois l'excelentissime Cliff Burton qui nous manque tous et surtout à Metallica, tj a la recherche d'un nv bassiste apres le depart de Jason."
4,"Porcupine Tree avait montré sur leurs précédents albums un réel potenciel dans le rock progressif. morceaux bien joués, ambiances variées avec cependant quelques longueurs synthétiques et des mixages moyens. avec ""in Absentia"" ce groupe est en train de passer un cap avec un album bien mixé, des morceaux très variés alternant tendances Floyd, Marillion. D'excellent musiciens ayant réussis à montrer leur potenciel sans pour autant délaisser le plaisir de la mélodie. 2 premiers titres digne de rentrer dans les charts pop-rock Anglais, des morceaux musicaux dignent d'ainés tel RUSH, et des guitares acoustiques superbes. un excellent album que je recommande vivement à tous les amoureux de rock progressif voir plus... un groupe à suivre de près assuremment. tonton gillou"
1,"La liberté de création pour un groupe c'est de pouvoir être prétentieux et pompeux après avoir été lumineux et audacieux. Dans le genre Archive est à l'avant-garde. ""Controlling the crowds"" atteint des sommets : morceaux interminables (10 mn dès le 1er titre !), plages musicales baclées tantot ""heavy metal"" (la fin de ""dangervisit"") ou guimauve (""funeral"")... et toujours cette influence PInk Floyd mal digérée (omniprésente sur tout l'album, ""words on signs"" en particulier). Quelques bons moments surnagent (""razed to the ground"" ou le début de ""dangervisit"") mais ne suffisent pas à sauver un ensemble bien indigeste. En conclusion : Vous avez adoré Londinium ? Moi aussi ! Alors n'allez pas plus loin !"
5,"Je viens d'écouter Medulla,il m'a fait l'effet d'un coup de poing dans le ventre... Je ne parviens pas à trouver les mots... Beatbox,fines programmations,choeurs monumentaux,etc...qui vous emmènent loin,très loin... J'ai rarement autant trippé à la première écoute d'un album... Sa voix est un bijou,on le savait,Medulla est le plus beau de ses écrins..."
2,"J'aime vraiment Björk... mais là... rien à faire.  Ce n'est pas un album, en tout cas, on dirait qu'il n'est pas achevé. On n'entend que des sons stridents accompagnés de choeur rendant l'ambiance encore plus morbide. Je comprends que ça peut plaire à certains mais franchement... à part complétement saoûl, c'est inécoutable."
2,"J'ai vraiment aimé l'album ""number one"" mais après avoir écouté l'album Acte 2 ,je peux dire qu'il y a quelques bons morceaux mais sans plus .Une chanson comme ""donne lui mon phone"" a un très bon rythme ,mais le problème se situe au niveau des paroles .Je pense que Willy Denzey a dû perdre beaucoup de fans (surtout les plus jeunes)à cause des paroles qui sont doivent être un peu trop dérangeantes dans certaines des chansons ,pour certaines personnes ."
1,"je suis profondémmet déçus par ce nouvel album , on pouvait attendre mieux!!excepter la chanson qui est aussi le titre de l'album:bright liht , le reste de l'album est completement nul en tant que fan de billy je pensais qu'il serais mieux et ne je ne peut que vous conseiller de ne pas l'acheter!!!"
5,j'adore ce CD je l'écoute en boucle tous les soirs (avec celui de Craig david) c'est un de mes préféré. Les paroles sont très belles et vous vont droit au coeur. Tout simplement irrésistible!
1,"rien à voir avec le volume 1 &amp; 2 qui sont superbes,à se poser des questions,car maintenant avec un bon ordi,on peut faire la même chose et mieux.trés déçus,titres ""funk"" inconnus et à peine mixés du vol.3 au vol.5,que des jingels et souvent les mêmes.je déconseil fortement à ceux qui ont 22 €uros à dépenser,vaut mieux investir dans autres choses.et aussi attention aux copies du volume 3,en vente dans certains magasins,sous une autre pochette.M. KHEOPS peut on se dire DJ et faire quelque chose d'aussi nul?.pour finir,merci l'ordinateur,je le pense vraiment,et tempis à ceux qui achéteront malgrés mes indices."
2,"un album décevant qui part un peu dans tous les sens, mais qui reste relativement correct, dommage!"
5,"il est génial comme tous les autres, des remix, des intrus, que du bon! je vous le conseille car il est vraiment bien"
1,"Ce disque est bien la preuve qu'il ne suffit pas d'être un excellent interprète pour faire un bon album. La voix de Maggie Reilly est aussi envoutante que sur le célebrissime Moonlight shadow...shadow... de Mike Oldfield. En revanche les chansons sont affublées de vulgaires mélodies insipides comme seule la mauvaise variété sait en produire. Les arrangements sont tellement démodés (parceque démodables) que l'on éprouve quelque pitié pour cette chanteuse qui méritait une toute autre aventure, dommage!"
2,"Cet album supporte la comparaison avec le précédent ""Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends"" (déjà une somme de ""faces B"", à mon avis), dont on ne peut le dissocier. En effet, ces 2 albums sont faits du même ""matériau de base"".  Probablement enregistrés dans le même temps ou presque (je reconnais mon ignorance sur ce point puisque je n'ai lu aucun article de presse à ce sujet). 8 titres au total, dont 2 (""Lost"" et ""Lovers In Japan"") sont re-balancés sans vergogne quasi à l'identique depuis l'album ""Viva la Vida..."" vers celui-ci. -Personnellement, je trouve la version chantée de ""Life in Technicolor"", meilleure que la version originale qui était instrumentale (elle constituait une intro sympa en concert, mais bon...sans plus). Elle y a gagné un petit supplément d'âme. -""Postcards from Far Away"" n'est qu'une jolie petite mélodie au piano (sincèrement)...mais de 48 secondes! -""Glass of Water"" n'est pas mal. Le refrain en particulier est assez entraînant et dégage une certaine énergie que j'apprécie. -""Rainy Day"": même remarque que pour le titre précédent, l'essentiel de l'émotion est dans le refrain et la minute finale. -""Prospekt's March / Poppyfields"": voilà une très belle pièce musicale, simple, sans fard, douce et subtile, qui me laisse penser que je jetterai tout de même une oreille sur le prochain album de Coldplay. -Enfin, ""Now My Feet Won't Touch the Ground"": c'est gentil, mignon sans atteindre des sommets, mais c'est très court. Mais j'ai gardé le meilleur pour la fin, le titre qui à lui seul justifie que je dépose un commentaire : ""Lost+"" Cette chanson est tellement ridicule, qu'elle en a des vertus roboratives. Je la conseille à tous ceux qui ont le cafard ; fou rire assuré ! J'imagine très bien la scène:  -""Euh, Jay-Z, y'a un groupe qui veut que tu rajoutes une piste sur un de leur titre. -OK, mais là, je suis aux toilettes... -Ça tombe bien, j'te passe le micro."" Ecoutez ce résultat complètement indigeste, à ranger dans la sélection des plus beaux PLOUF de l'année. Le rappeur (Jay-Z) vient s'incruster à un moment, comme une touffe de poils sur la soupe. Les univers musicaux de Jay-Z et Coldplay sont aussi éloignés que les lieux géographiques où ils ont dû respectivement faire les prises de son. Quant au mixage, il est digne d'un bidouillage rapide de stagiaire avec un logiciel gratuit! Abo-minable. ""Qui aime bien, châtie bien"": Je n'adhère pas du tout à cet adage, mais pour une fois je l'applique. J'aime ce groupe depuis ses débuts mais je trouve qu'il y a ici un manque de professionnalisme et de respect pour le public, et son argent, que je n'ai jamais rencontré à ce niveau (ou est-ce une farce...?)."
5,"oui c'est mon album préféré des white stripes...le son est bien rock avec des inspirations bluesy. Comme d'habitude c'est un duo batterie/guitare avec jack au chant. quelques bijoux comme cette reprise de son house ""death letter"" qui est incroyable et également la chanson ""little bird"" Mais l'album en entier est de haute tenue. UN incontournable pour tous les amateurs de rock et de guitare."
1,"Ne pas oublier que Melissa Auf Der Maur était avant tout la bassiste la plus classe du monde aux côtés de Mme Kurt Cobain au sein du groupe Hole.Or, de la classe, c'est exactement ce qu'il manque dans ce disque quelque peu Hard FM où la qualité n'est jamais supérieure à la somme des invités.  Je ne reproche pas à Miss Auf Der Maur d'avoir fait un album métal plutôt qu'un disque Indie Pop, mais quel que soit le choix du style on attendait une véritable démarche d'artiste, des compositions bétons et des textes fouillés et personnels. Et là, on tombe des nues, très loin de Queens of the Stone Age, encore plus loin de Hole, Liz Phair ou PJ Harvey. On est vraiment en manque d'un véritable univers personnel. Au lieu de ça, Melissa nous sort le morceau teenage rock en Français (pour respecter les 40 % de quotas de chanson française et pour squatter le marché québecquois, pas folle la guêpe) aux paroles insipides et aux accords éculés. Après un tribute à Black Sabbath d'une grande médiocrité qu'on mettait pudiquement sur le compte d'un crise d'adolescence tardive, on finit par perdre tout espoir en la belle canadienne. Lâchez donc ce produit trop marketé et écoutez The Distillers ou Errase Errata pour du rock féminin qui envoie réellement très lourd."
4,"Cet album constitue le troisième d'une trilogie composée de ""Dogs and butterfly"",""Littlequeen"" (le meilleur) et celui-ci. Trilogie car il constitue avec les deux autres, la crème du group pour la période des années 70. Ensuite, le groupe deviendra beaucoup plus FM (pas mauvais mais il faut être amateur) et calibré rock amerloque. Voilà un groupe qui n'est jamais venu en Europe, qui a une discographie impressionnante et qui est, à tort, vraiment méconnu."
2,"Je possède ce coffret (j'ai eu les versions 33t à l'époque) et ce qui est impardonnable c'est de ""couper"" les albums : Pendulum se retrouve sur 2 CD !!! (Cosmo's factory suivi de Pendulum, forcément il n'y avait pas assez de place, quand on voit le prix ils auraient pu ajouter un CD. Ce n'est peut-être pas un problême pour ceux qui n'ont pas connu les albums originaux, mais un puriste regrettera ce choix, de plus, franchement, les 6 premiers albums originaux de CCR suffisent, le reste ne vaut pas le détour, sauf peut-être la première version de ""walk on the water"" que je trouve meilleure que celle figurant sur l'album CCR.Même les albums ""Live"" ne m'ont pas branché. Seul point positif,avec ce coffret vous avez l'intégrale de CCR, mais est-il indispensable d'être en possession du meilleur et du pire d'un groupe de musique ?"
1,"Même si les thèmes abordés sont interessants, on sent que Gabriel veut ""bien faire (ou faire bien, c'est selon)"". Troplèché au niveau du son, le disque en devient insipide et ennuyeux comme un dimanche de pluie."
5,J'ai reçu la boîte hier. Le son te met une grande claque dans la figure ! Le remixage a été merveilleusement bien réalisé par Nick Davis. On est très loin du son des CD d'origine et pourtant c'est bien la même prise de son datant de presque 30 ans ! Le SACD est à mon avis un cran au dessus de la version DVD-DTS. On voit ici très nettement l'intérêt du SACD qui donne une aération remarquable de la musique. Les détails inaudibles jusqu'à maintenant ressortent très nettement et on redécouvre ces 5 albums avec beaucoup de plaisir. A posséder impérativement même si l'on possède déjà les albums d'origine.
4,"Voici le 1er album de Marillion dans ce qui allait être le virage du groupe, et l'arrivée du nouveau chanteur, Steve Hogarth..... Plus grand chose à voir avec Fish, si ce n'est le côté toujours plutôt sombre des textes... La musique s'est nettement adoucie et se veut plus melancholique qu'avant, la voix de Steve s'y pretant mieux....Une voix bien plus douce et moins agressive que celle de notre ""poisson""... Mention tres bien à Easter, qui reste l'une des plus belles réussites du chanteur encore aujourdhui, mais aussi à After Me, ou The Space, grandiose...L'unique Bémol que j'ai relevé : Hooks in You, un morceau qui a peine à trouver sa place au milieu de l'album...comme une chute de studio....En tout cas, un 1er album superbe, pour l'entrée en scène de Hogarth, qui allait en appeler bien d'autres..."
1,"Apres un debut de carriere tres brillant, metallica quitte definitivement le monde du metal avec son album eponyme. Finie l'originalite, finis les morceaux epiques, finis les riffs epoustouflants. C'est a peine si Kirk se souvient comment jouer de la guitare, la voix de James s'est degradee en comparaison de leur 3 premiers albums. Cet album est tres decevant, mais ne fait qu'annoncer la triste suite de la carriere du groupe. Si vous n'avez jamais ecoute metallica, je vous conseille plutot leurs 3 premiers albums (Kill'em All, Ride the Lightning et Master of Puppets), qui sont veritablement des chef-d'oeuvres du Thrash."
1,"Euh là c'est trust bernie parle ne chante plus,nono est discret et en plus y a un dj, très mauvaise reprise du morceau ""surveille ton look"" .Il est lent meconnaissable,ecouter la premiere version, là on prends son pied,trust et mort vive trust, une autre epoque bien triste commence."
5,"Un excellent live qui reproduit avec l'exactitude d'un métronome toutes les chansons de ses deux premiers albums... Attention très grands professionnels du métal!!!! Rien de bien neuf certes, mais l'immense plaisir pour ceux qui n'ont pas eu la chance de le voir en concert, de retrouver sur ce double cd l'atmosphère délicate et incisive d'un live de blaze!"
5,"un tripop tres travallé melangant ambiances melodies et rifs ,d'une efficacité infaible il en ressort un son unique qui plait forcement a tout amateur de musique"
5,"En 1994 sortait cet album,Hex,dans une relative indifférence.Presque 10 ans aprés,il reste le Graal musical d'une infime poignées d'initiés...Pourtant,Bark Psychosis n'avait en aucun cas une identité élitiste.Il faisait une musique certes exigeante mais qui savait aussi être généreuse d'émotions...On croit parfois plonger dans le Rock Progressif des années 70 mais on est désarçonnés par une mélodie Pop plus immédiate.Nous voici ensuite face à un passage expérimental plus ardu mais largement plus écoutable que les dérives répétitives de certains groupes de Post Rock.Bark Psychosis reste aujourd'hui injustement méconnu du grand public.Pourtant,un groupe comme Radiohead (que tout le monde connait)joue dans un même registre (Radiohead connait-il Bark Psychosis ? On peut se le demander par la proximité des sonorités) Bark Psychosis restera un groupe unique en sortant un album de cet acabit,d'une telle magie et d'une telle puissance émotionnelle. Pour preuve de la méconnaissance de Bark Psychosis,je suis le premier à m'atteler à la tâche difficile du commentaire.Esperons que ce petit point de vue vous donnera envie d'écouter ce CD et qui sait de transmettre votre passion de ce groupe en écrivant à votre tour un commentaire. A ce moment là la boucle sera bouclée   Bonne écoute"
4,"A l'écoute des premiers titres de l'album,je me suis dis:""Tiens?!,guitares énervées,son plus lourds,ils auraient virés vers la FUSION?!""puis arrivé vers le 7eme ou 8eme titre j'ai trouvé un son plus à mon gôut pour carrémment jubiler sur le 10eme et 11eme,je retrouvais enfin le ""phunky Cypress Hill""!!! Non,plus sérieusement l'album est mortel quelques sons sélectionnés par Muggs surprennent mais on kiffe après plusieurs écoutes,mais j'avoue quand même que ma préférée est ""Lowrider"" d'ailleur quand elle tape dans ma plage arrière,j'ai l'impression que ma bagnole fait des bonds comme celles du clip. Essayez; M.O.R.T.E.L je vous dis!!!"
5,"quel est le groupe de rock progressif qui arrive a jouer des morceaux de 12minutes qui n'en paraissent que 3? Quel est le groupe qui fait du progressif contemporain à la maniere des Floyd en leur temps? Quel est le groupe de prog qui reussit à vous tenir en alerte plus d'une heure? Quel est le groupe de prog qui surclasse Marillion depuis quelques CD? Quel est le groupe de prog qui utilise les synthés délicatement sans surcharge? Quel est le groupe de prog qui vous fera oublier IQ, Arena,Kino ...et la plupart des masturbateurs en mal d'émotions? Etc..etc...Simplicité, efficacité,energie,dépouillement, beauté. Une réussite!"
2,"L'idée Sax + Accordéon n'est pas mal mais le son parfois oriental de Trygve Seim n'est pas indispensable, Anour Brahem et son groupe font beaucoup mieux. Dans le même genre, je préfère largement Galliano/Portal; quant à l'accordéoniste Frode Halti, il est loin de notre superbe musicien : Daniel Mille ! Ce cd est un coup d'épée dans l'eau comparé au must de 2002 : The Source and Different Cikadas. Je suis vraiment déçu par Trygve Seim mais je reste confiant quant au prochain opus car je suis persuadé qu'il est un excellent musicien."
5,"le dialogue magnifique de deux maîtres du saxophone l'un au ténor,l'autre à l'alto, épaulés par jimmy rowlles au piano,leroy winnegar à la basse, mel lewis à la batterie. Ici l'on ne joue pas seulement pour soi mais à deux voix. bien que l'on assiste là à une magnifique démonstration de style jazz cool on est trés proche quelquefois de l'art de la fugue avec ses entrelacs et de la musique de bach dans ses harmonies.  une des plus belles rencontres de l'histoire du jazz une prise de son qui respecte bien les timbres des instuments"
1,"Les commentaires précédents ont mis le doigt sur la médiocrité de la prise de son de cette sortie. C'est un euphémisme... Je n'insisterai pas, cet album est un pirate non autorisé, point. Mais l'essentiel est peut-être ailleurs.  Afin qu'il n'y ait pas d'ambiguïté, je n'aime pas ""Calling All Stations"" et cela ne peut pas être totalement sans influence sur le petit compte rendu qui suit. J'apprécie Ray Wilson par ailleurs, ceci dit.  Sans doute impressionné par la charge, et trop respectueux de ses aînés, ce pauvre Ray peine à se ré-approprier les vieilles chansons et ne réussit bien trop souvent qu'à singer les inflexions de voix de l'un ou de l'autre de ses prestigieux prédécesseurs. Il essaye de bien faire pourtant (et y réussit par intermittence, ""Follow You Follow Me"" est rafraîchissant...) mais on sent bien que c'est dur. L'homme n'y est pas, l'habit est trop grand pour lui, il reste sur sa réserve, ne sait pas s'il faut monter d'une octave, bafouille, chante faux, ne suit pas (""I Can't Dance"" à 3'43)... Sur les titres du dernier album il s'en sort quand même mieux, et c'est bien la moindre des choses. ""Calling All Stations"" et ""The Dividing Line"" offrent même des instrumentaux qui font penser à Genesis.  Bon, si vous êtes fan de Ray Wilson ou collectionneur de Genesis vous craquerez peut-être. Sinon passez votre chemin !"
1,"Après le somptueux coffret 1970-1975 reprenant les premiers albums du groupe, voila un coffret live qui sur le principe était prometteur mais sur la réalisation est une déception. Au lieu de nous proposer des enregistrements live originaux (concert au Milton Keynes en 1982, par exemple au hasard) et d'effectuer un travail de restauration de ces bandes sons, le coffret ne reprend que les lives existants agrémentés de bonus que l'on retrouve sur les précédents coffrets du groupe (Genesis Archives 1967-1975 notamment). Ce coffret au relent d'opération marketing, ne peut évidemment que ravir le collectionneur ou le fan fou furieux qui aurait tout de même de l'argent à dépenser ..."
2,"ah mais que de regrets.. je n'ose imaginer ces chansons pas si mal foutues mais chantées par Tarja bon sang !!!! quel désastre de l'avoir laissé partir. nouvelle chanteuse très moyenne, sans plus, ok-bof. enfin disons qu'elle s'en sort quand meme pas si mal meme si Marco chante de plus en plus... cd pas mauvais au final mais bon faut oublier et ne plus penser que c'est le meme groupe. snif"
2,"Une partie instrumentale très bonne quoi que mon inspirée que d'habitude. PAr contre la nouvelle voix de Nigthwish, Anette Olzon, tient plus des Corrs qu'autre chose. Du coup Nightwish perd 50% de son impact et se fond dans la masse des groupe de métal voir même rock/pop à présent. Dommage...."
2,"Que dire, à part que c'est une grande déception, fini le mélange subtil de rock gothique symphonique associé à la voix puissante et vibrante de Tarja. Un groupe qui sortait du lot... Je n'ai rien contre la nouvelle chanteuse Anette, mais je trouve qu'elle est bien trop ""ordinaire"", et désolé de ma franchise, au risque d'en froisser certains..., certes les compositions de Tuomas sont toujours aussi bonnes et bien travaillées, mais ça ne prend pas..., cette nouvelle formation manque peut-être encore d'une âme, et dommage, car je n'ai pas eu l'occasion de voir l'ancienne formation en concert..., ce n'est donc pas cette année que j'aurai envie de les voir... Pour conclure, je dirai que ce nouvel album est relativement agréable à écouter, il bénéficie d'un bon effet de marketing et attirera plutôt de nouveaux fans du genre et risque de décevoir bien des fans ayant apprécié leurs précédents albums..."
1,"Nul ! sans aucun intérêt...je déconseille leur disque (juste bon a passer en boucle sur NRJ) une "" musique"" commercial sans innovation et audace...une veritable insulte pour les nouveaux groupes  HARD-Fi est au Rock a se que le chewing-gum est a la Gastronomie ATTENTION AU RISQUE D'INDIGESTION...... PS : j'ai mis 1 étoile car il est impossible de mettre ZERO  Dommage........"
5,"J'aime beaucoup cet album des Flower Kings! Certains ont regretté l'absence d'epics de 20 ou 30 minutes, pas moi... Je trouve le groupe très à l'aise dans ce format plus rock, plus concis (ça reste relatif, évidemment!). Les riffs de guitare sont déments, triturés dans tous les sens, bien plus puissants que d'habitude, mode Metal prog' oblige (le fantastique morceau d'ouverture ""Last minute on earth"", par exemple), les vocaux sont toujours aussi parfaits, et surtout on retrouve, au milieu des délires en tout genre, ces ambiances plus acoustiques, moins pompeuses, et riches en émotion : le morceau ""Elaine"", avec sa deuxième partie qui s'évade en un jazz plein de groove (nouveau bassiste phénoménal), est à mon sens une des plus belles réussites de ce groupe qui renoue ici, au-delà des ressemblances parfois appuyées avec Genesis, Yes, voire Uriah Heep, avec une musique vraiment ""progressive"" - au sens où elle brasse des millions d'influences sans jamais prendre la tête... Mention spéciale au dernier morceau, ""Serious Dreamers"", funky à souhait, ensoleillé comme un épisode de ""La croisière s'amuse"", et qui donnera des boutons aux fans de progressif prétendu ""sérieux"". Le plus accessible pour un public rock, donc, et encore une vraie boîte à merveilles!"
2,"Les Adjectifs ne manquent pas pour décrire cet Album! Quelle énorme déception...! Vraimment j'èsperais beaucoup mieux! Bon je vais me lancer... 1- Si vous aimez, non si vous adorez, mieux si vous ne pouvez pas vous passez de synthétiseurs ou de musique electronique, alors cet album est fait pour vous! Mais ne me dites pas que c'est un Album de Rock!! NON s'est en pas un! 2- Je connais un Greg Lake qui aurait du rester chez un groupe qui s'apelle King crimson... Ca c'etait un Grand Groupe! 3- Quand j'entend dire que c'est un des meilleurs Albums de Rock Progressif, c'est tout simplement faux...Faux et encore FAUX! Si vous aimez le Rock Progressif, achetez Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Jethro Tull, Van Der Graaf Generator, Yes ou encore Caravan, mais surtout pas Emerson, Lake and Palmer! 4- Meme si vous aimez la musique électronique, les compositions sont tres mediocres! Presque pas de melodie, de long solos de synthés et des Paroles d'une niaiserie encore inégalée (Combat entre deux robots pour enfant!!). 5- L'internaute qui dit que c'est le disque le plus important de sa vie...Mon Dieu que sa vie doit etre triste! 6- Pour finir, je dirais que L'Album TARKUS d'Emerson, Lake and Palmer est...comment pourrais-je dire...euh...un très très Mauvais Album comme on en fait de nos jours! Exepté les Albums des Whites-Stripes, des Strokes et des Libertines! Bye"
5,"Voici la formule qui réussit le mieux à cet artiste d'exception. Un album intime, intense dans sa retenue et sobriété. Le jeu efficace des Allemands à la basse et à la batterie complète à merveille celui de Chris Whitley. L'album comporte quelques unes des meillleures compositions de Whitley à ce jour : Hotel Vast Horizon,  Blues for André... Une production irréprochable, bref,  vivement le prochain chef d'oeuvre de Chris Whitley!"
5,"Encore une fois, Béla Fleck nous démontre que tout peut être joué au banjo. Il nous livre là un disque magnifique qui convaincra jusqu'aux plus irréductibles de la musique classique."
1,"Titre usurpé pour cet album, à moins qu'il n'anticipe la réaction des ""heureux"" acquéreurs trompés par les étoiles indûment attribuées à celui-ci... Tempos anémiques, enregistrements bâclés, aggravés par une production inexistante, l'énergie est absente de cet opus, aux antipodes de la prestation enjouée et inventive du groupe à WOODSTOCK - cf. triple album WOODSTOCK - Ennui garanti à l'écoute de cette bouillie sonore informe et soporifique.  Pour collectionneur inconditionnel de fonds de tiroir, peut-être ?"
2,"Mais oui, personnellement j'ai eu une grosse déception avec cet album de reprise, j'imagine que si Genesis les avait joués ainsi je ne les aurai pas appréciés à leur juste valeur.  Les arrangements de ""for absent friends"" ou ""your own special way"" sont mous et à la limite de la variété, certains sons sont désagréables et les essais pour se différencier des originaux tombent souvent à plat.  Non définitivement, si vous voulez de bonnes versions de ces chansons, écoutez plutôt ""The Tokyo Tapes"", là oui Steve Hackett &amp; ses acolytes arrivent à donner l'ampleur que méritent les excellents morceaux du Genesis des débuts."
4,"L'expérience des membres de Saga jaillit brillamment sur ce live enregistré récemment à Munich, où s'étalle une set-list en forme de best-of. Interprétation et qualité du son sont optimales... que demander de plus à un live ? Pour le reste, cet opus en public s'adresse aux fans, qui sauront apprécier à sa juste valeur la maîtrise d'un groupe plein de finesse sur scène. Saga fait partie des grands, et le prouve encore !"
5,Dommage que ce groupe reste inconnu en France car c'est vraiment un tres bon groupe. C'est une tres bonne compil et un excellent live.
5,"Ils adoraient les 5 de Detroit, et ont adopté le même line up. Les Ramones les aimaient et réciproquement (d'ailleurs New York a quand même produit de sacrées pointures en rock !!). Vous aimez le rock qui a la pêche, efficace et dynamique sans être simpliste, avec des solos de guitare virtuoses sans boursouflures (Ross est bien un Boss), un chanteur infatigable (Handsome Dick Manitoba), un excellent compositeur bassiste (Andy Shernoff), un 2ème guitariste qui fait plus qu'assurer (Scott 'Top Ten') et un batteur qui ne s'arrête pas (Thunderbolt Patterson): achetez ce disque qui est un best of en plus d'un live d'une très bonne qualité de production (tiens? encore Andy Shernoff). Ce groupe a apporté sa pierre trop mésetimée dans les 70s à l'histoire du hard / punk rock. Ce live des années 2000 nous les offre au sommet."
5,"Ce dernier disque des fatals picards est de loin leur meilleur! Les textes sont toujours excellents voire même meilleurs qu'avant, au niveau musicale le groupe s'est également nettement amélioré Au niveau des chansons, le groupe touche à tout les sujets de la vie de tout les jours (politique, gothiques, emploi, jeux...) ainsi que quelques reprises comme partenaire particulier"
2,"Après ""1492"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Mythodéa"" et autres, on pouvait s'attendre à quelque chose de grandiose pour le film Alexander. Et en effet, c'est grandieuse, tout est grandieuse, c'est trop grandiose. Il n'y a pas de nuance et c'est assez poussif même pour le thème ""The Charge"". Inutile,de chercher la subtilité de la musique. C'est simplement ""C'est moi qui passe, Alexandre   le Grand le plus beau, le plus fort, le plus beau. Inutile de chercher d'envolées épiques comme celles que l'on peut trouver chez Elfman, Shore ou Zimmer. Et parlant de Zimmer, j'ai limite l'impression d'entendre l'ambiance que l'on trouvait dans certains thèmes langoureux de ""Gladiator"". J'ai essayé d'écouter plusieurs fois cette BO, mais elle est tellement fade et sans couleur, que j'en oublierai presque  qu'elle en dans la chaine. Aujourd'hui dimanche 11 février 2007, il est environ 15 heures, j'écris ce texte en écoutant la BO en question. Dès que la critique sera enregistrée, je rangerai le Cd dans sa boite et je ne l'en ressortirai pas d'ici longtemps. Dans ce genre de BO, il ne sert à rien de mettre du garndiose, s'il n'est pas accompagné premièrement d'un thème original et deuxièmement d'un rythme effréné pour les batailles. Finalement, et contrairement à de nombreuses BO, celle-ci ne me donne même pas envie de voir le film."
2,"Cette compil retrace la deuxième période de Cabaret Voltaire (avec les changements de line-up que l'on connait), là ou le groupe perd de vue le son sombre et expérimental des débuts pour une musique plus dansante. L'ensemble est assez crispant et le mélange musique industrielle/funk s'avère raté par manque de recul de la part des musiciens. Reste une musique encore inclassable à l'heure actuelle, mais d'un intérêt limité, même pour le fan d'indus. A écouter pour étoffer sa culture musicale...à la limite."
5,"rythmé ,énergique , beau et mixé par un DJ très talentueux . On atteint là un niveaux très élévé ou il est difficile de faire mieux en matière de trance.   j'adhère totalement !!!!"
5,"Superbe nouvel opus de Tosca (Richard Dorfmeister)! C'est de l'electro pur, mais c'est une fois de plus un son nouveau, de la variété dans les titres, bref un album à ecouter en boucle. Le Cd 2 par contre est inutile. Morceaux de piano ridicules."
5,"Avec sa voix grave et son piano, Vincent Delerm nous décrit la société avec humour, gravité et tendresse . Il nous parle d'amour avec Vérité (qui ne se reconnait pas dans la rupture décrite dans son titre Cosmopolitan), avec délicatesse, des textes soignés et toujours son complice si chantant et enivrant: le piano Quelques grammes de tendresse et d'humour dans ce monde de guerre! Un délice..."
5,"La relève du Blues est là. Le blues alternatif joué par deux furieux avec un son ""Roots, Johnny Roots""! Moi qui ne vient pas du blues mais plutôt vachement punk/hardcore: je suis scotché comme ça m' était pas arrivé depuis Muddy Waters dans mes années 80. Ce sont des gars comme ça qui apportent de l' eau fraîche au moulin de cette musique qui en a bien besoin. Bonne écoute!"
4,"Ce nouvel opus des Fiery Furnaces est sans doute plus un retour vers EP qu'une continuation dans le style ""Blueberry Boat"" / ""Bitter Tea"" / ""Widow City"". Au début on peut être déçus quand, comme c'est mon cas, on a commencé avec les FF par Blueberry Boat par exemple. Mais après quelques écoutes, on se rend compte que c'est un bon album : sans doute moins de chansons ""hypnotiques"", mais tout aussi efficaces. On sent quand même la patte des FF et de ce qui en fait un groupe à part. Loin d'être du réchauffé, c'est une face plus ""polie"" de leur talent."
5,"Jay Dee sort sur le label anglais BBE ce CD, premier d'une serie trés prométeuse. Connu pour ces prods sur les albums de Common et Erykah Badu,Jay Dee ce démarque de la tendance électronique actuelle (The Neptunes, Dre, Timbaland, Rza...) Par un style acoustique et envoutant cher au Roots et à toute la Mouvance philadelphienne. Jay Dee est maitre de la compositon ""Traditionnelle"" en arrivant à nous faire ressentir le style soul des années 70 sans jouer la carte de la nostalgie. Aidé par de vrai musicien il impose un style qui force le respect et donne un souffle et une alternative indispensable au Hip Hop outre atlantique."
2,"Fan de la série après avoir acheté les deux premiers volumes, je m'attendais à mieux de la part du troisième opus. A mon goût y'a un peu de trop de chanteurs à la voix plus ou moins sirupeuse, alors que les deux premiers volumes sont essentiellement instrumentaux et très marqués funk-jazz...visiblement ils ont du râcler les fonds de tiroirs pour compléter ce troisième album."
4,"ambient et pop à la fois (les morceaux ne durent pas trois plombes), pur disque pour planer les yeux fermés, à conseiller aux fans de Sigur Ros, Boards of Canada..."
5,"C'est grand, c'est beau, touchant, en tension permanente dans la plénitude du chant. On ne trouvera ici aucune mièvrerie, aucune hésitation, mais du feu et de la glace. Le grand art de l'un des plus grands violonistes de tous les temps !"
2,"Vous n'aimez pas MOZART mais décidément pas! Rassurez vous ce  disque est fait pour vous. Où est la légèreté, le génie et l'audace de  cette musique? Sous les doigts glenngouldesques, comme par un curieux  enchantement tout s'évanouit. On s'ennuie ferme dans l'adagio de la  sonate n°14, les allegros perdent de leur brio...bref comme disait Boris  VIAN plus cyniquement dans ""MOZART avec nous"" : MOZART ne méritait pas  ça mais faut bien vi ivrrrre."
5,"On retrouve bien dans cet album toute l'originalité de cet artiste. Coup de coeur particulier pour le titre ""ma liberté de penser"". Mais tous les titres sont exceptionnels!!!"
1,"Indiscutablement, cet album est historique. Dont acte. Pour le reste, laissez moi rire! La domination de McCartney sur cet album? Propagande alimentée par Lennon lui même ( lisez ses interviews vous verrez)! Un titre écrase le reste, c'est bien sûr ""A day in the life"". Le reste? Une belle production, un titre sympa autour du cirque...C'est aussi un album révolutionnaire car il est le premier disque dont la forme compte plus que le fond! Un concept? Mais oui, il a un concept: celui de ne pas en avoir!Honnêtement, si vous avez déjà tous les disques des Beatles, est-ce celui là que vous écoutez le plus? Quand l'avez vous écouté pour la dernière fois? Pour ma part c'est le white album / album blanc et Abbey road que j'écoute le plus et le plus régulièrement!"
4,"L' un des premiers albums de la Family Stone, moins connu que Stand! ou There's a riot going On, mais qu' il serait dommage de négliger, Dance to the Music est un opus déjà gorgé de funk libérateur, de soul salvatrice, de trouvailles vocales hors-norme, de rythmes dansants et de sonorités psychédéliques.  Le disque s' ouvre d' emblée sur des titres explosifs ( ""Dance to the music"", et ""Higher"", première mouture de ce qui deviendra plus tard ""I want to take you higher"" sur Stand! ) et ne relache guère la pression d' un bout à l' autre. C' en est presque épuisant ! mais le plaisir ne désemplit pas, à l' écoute de ce combo passé maitre-artificier dans l' art du groove épicé...  Avis aux amateurs, cette musique si énergique pouvant finalement plaire aussi bien aux funk-addicts qu'aux jazzmen ou aux rockers !"
2,"Ca me fait un peu de peine de ne pas pouvoir être pleinement d'accord avec le commentaire de Nadine, mais, personnellement, et c'est bien mon avis personnel que l'on me demande de laisser dans ce commentaire, je suis très loin d'être emballé par ce mélange pourtant prometteur sur papier et sans aucun doute sur scène aussi. En effet, tout manouche que soit le jazz proposé ici, il se marrie assez difficilement avec le cheap electro qui l'accompagne. Les musiciens sont talentueux c'est un fait, pleins d'une énergie qui malheureusement perd énormément de son impact derrière le mur de machine déployé pour sonner plus actuel. Oui, je n'ai pas peur de le crier haut et fort, si les instruments organiques sont particulièrement efficaces et synamiques, les machines, quant à elles, sonnent bien peu inspirées et originales avec des sons déjà entendus 1000 fois et qui n'apportent absolument rien a la structure originale des morceaux. En résumé, des chansons interressantes et bien construites sur lesquelles on a malheureusement déversé un bien peu ragoutante mélasse boum-boum-bling-bliguesque qui plus est déjà datée au moment de la sortie du disque."
2,"La vie de commentateur  « amazoniaque » est décidément bien  ingrate...figurez vous que l'autre jour , j'avais un commentaire mais pas de titre, et bien cette fois j'ai un titre mais pas de commentaire ! Je laisserai donc la note exprimer mon point de vue sur cet album. En deux mots quand même , c'est vrai que ce concept de jazz mixé avec de l'electro, on se dit pourquoi pas et on jette une oreille pour la curiosité mais rapidement cela devient lassant puis insupportable. L'amateur de jazz fuira à toute jambe ; quant aux amateurs d'electro...on ne peut jurer de rien avec eux.."
5,"Kanye west signe là un de ses meilleurs opus, fidèle à son premier, touchant juste tant dans le fond que dans la forme. Un excellent cd du meilleur rappeur us actuel à mon goût. À posséder donc pour toute personne aprécient le vrai rap !"
1,"Kanye West sera (c'est sa maison de disques qui l'a décidé) le prochain roi du rap, de la pop, de la soul, ... de tout ce que voulez. Il y a dans ce Cd des samples, voire des passages entiers de chansons de Ray Charles, Curtis Mayfield, Shirley Bassey, Otis Redding, ... enfouis dans dans un brouet sonore calibré pour passer en boucle sur MTV Base... Les connaisseurs ( ? ) disent que Kanye West a une super voix.  Florent Pagny et Pavarotti aussi. C'est pas une raison pour les écouter ..."
2,"Ce ""nouvel"" album ne presente rien de tres nouveau: les themes abordes sont les meme(le dramatique ""white america"",on retrouve du ""way i am"",son enfant qu'il aime toujours autant,enfin son egotrip slimshadyien),les rythmes sont presque anticipables,on reconnait la patte imposante de DrDre sur ""my dad's gone crazy"":une similitude avec le titre ""BadIntentions"" de the wash ... Eminem,jeune prodige du music business nous presente un nouveau moule plus elabore du point de vue technique mais n'oublions pas que cette oeuvre provient d'un moule,donc forcement on se lasse du ""deja-vu"" perpetuel. Le pseudo jeune nous vend toujours la meme personnalite de l'adolescent mal dans sa peau,en crise d'identite,schizo sous influences narcotiques,jeune pere a cause dun oubli de preservatif mais qui lassume,et bien sur en revolte contre la societe ... Tout un programme ou seul les plus bornes persistent a s'identifier,mais pourquoi changer une recette qui fonctionne alors que les consommateurs en redemandent?? A la recherche d'un son plus authentique?Jetez une oreille sur ""the SlimShady LP"":il en vaut beaucoup plus la peine que ce ""produit derive"""
4,"On ne présente évidemment plus Jay-Z, un des plus grands rappeurs actuels from New-York City. Pourtant, il révèle ici tous ses talents, à savoir la présence vocale, un ""flow"" très cool (très différent du style plus agressif de nombreux autres rappeurs) et des lyrics très personnels.Jay-Z s'offre un peu un retour aux sources du hip-hop avec un petit côté ""soul"" sur certains titres et la collaboration musicale des Roots. Et puis on a le droit à la cerise sur le gateau : un duo featuring Mary J. Blige ""live"" dans les studios de MTV New-York....A ne pas manquer"
5,"Dans cet album live, Jay Z confirme son statut de grand rappeur from Brooklyn. Il enchaîne les tubes, fait participer son public et son ""flow"" est toujours aussi cool, même lorsqu'il s'attaque à Nas et Mobb Deep dans ""Takeover"". La participation des Roots apporte une petite touche ""nu-soul"" notamment sur ""Song cry"" et ""H.O.V.A"". Mais alors quand ""Queen Mary"" J. Blige vient en featuring sur ""Can't knock the hustle"" et qu'elle enchaîne sur ""Family affair""...c'est le bonheur !!! Un des rares albums que j'écoute en boucle..."
5,"Exellent opus qui pour moi  fait au moins partie des 10 meilleurs albums East Coast de ces dernieres années. Les titres préférés sont: ""Mom playing "" avec Scarface ""nothing like it"", ""for my niggaz"" avec Daz, ""Still got love for you"" bien sur les autres sont aussi très bon mais je finirai par citer tous les titres de l'album si je continuait !"
2,"On peut être déçu par ce premier album de Juelz Santana, pourtant présenté comme un des futurs cracks du rap US. L'album lui même n'est pas mauvais, mais pour ceux qui suivent les Diplomats depuis que Cam'Ron a rejoint Roc-A-Fella, ils risquent d'être déçu par le ton très monotone de cet opus. La plupart des morceaux sont produits par les Heatmakers, crew de production spécialisé dans le samplage des vieilles chansons soul des années 60. Les productions sont très bonnes, mais se ressemblent malheureusement toutes. De plus, de nombreux morceaux figuraient déjà sur la mixtape ""Final Destination"". Pour résumer, on pourrait dire que ceux qui ont aimé l'album Diplomatic Immunity des Diplomats aimeront l'album, pour les autres, la pillule devrait être plus difficile à avaler!"
4,"quand j'ai acheté le CD c'était juste car on m'en avait beaucoup parlé(copine télé radio)pour tout vous dire je n'était pas vraiment sur que tout l'album allé me plaire mais en réalité je le trouve génial avril déchire grave elle est naturelle est vu que j'adore le pop le rock evidemment j'ai adoré ""let go""d' avril lavigne mais je trouve que 4 sur 5 c'est la bonne note !!5 sur 5 c'est trop car les chansons ne son pas assez différente je m'en sui vite lassé donc j'attent de voir comment et son prochain   album!!!!bisous a tout le monde et vive le rock!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"un tres bonne album que nous livre ici le crew d'eminem quoique un peu moin bien que le fabuleaux marshall mathers d'eminem mais bon du tres bon sons quand meme et puis le prochain album du maitre ne devrais pas tarder, courage car l'attente sera tres tres tres longue"
5,"Très bon album! Une véritable bombe lâchée par ces deux mecs du Dirty South! Mériteraient d' être connus, ce groupe rivalise avec les plus grands(Dr Dre,Nas,Jay-Z,...) A se procurer de toute urgence!"
1,"Après nous avoir habitué à des hits r&amp;b et avoir participé à de nombreux featuring (tjs r&amp;b), ce qui lui a fait perdre de sa crédibilité, Ja revient à ses sources... c'est à dire au rap médiocre. C'est sûr qu'après avoir attiré les foudres d'une foule d'artistes rap (Eminem, 50 Cent, Obie Trice, D-12, Dr Dre, Busta Rhymes, Outlawz, DMX,...), les dégats se font ressentir sur cet album. Un album très court (45min) avec une intro, 3 skits inutiles et 2 freestyles histoire de. De plus, à force de perdre son temps à discréditer 50 Cent sur Thing Gon Change et Clap Back, se prendre pour 2Pac (Niggaz &amp; Bitchez) et representer son crew (Tha Inc Is Back), il y a franchement rien à se mettre sous la dent... à part peut être The Crown et encore, j'crois que c'est perdu d'avance. Désolé Ja Rule mais tu n'es plus dans le rap game..."
5,"... et je pèse mes mots! Cette production n'a pris une ride depuis sa sortie en 1986... C'est l'album cultissime par excellence du mouvement thrash et pour SLAYER, il est le maître-étalon sur lequel on jugera les productions passées et à venir du gang californien...  Cet album très court car joué sur un rythme syncopé ne s'apprécie pleinement qu'après plusieurs écoute et dès lors, c'est l'addiction garantie! C'est fou mais ""Reign in Blood"" est un album que j'arrive à écouter et ré-écouter sans m'en lasser près de vingt-ans après... C'est dire l'excellence de sa conception qui à marqué toute une génération de métalleux... Bien évidemment Slayer à produit autre chose dans sa carrière tout aussi valable mais, rien d'aussi radical dans sa brutalité...  ""Reign in Blood"" fit scandale dès sa sortie à propos de textes tendencieux concernant l'ange de la mort d'auschwitz, le tristement célèbre docteur Josef Mengele décrit dans ses oeuvre par le titre ""Angel of Death"". Il faut bien le reconnaîtres, Slayer est également connu pour ses paroles à la limite de la provocation plus ou moins gratuite et pour  sa fascination du mal en général... Que l'on apprécie ou non, c'est ainsi. A prendre ou à laisser... PS : Cette réédition inclu deux titres supplémentaires dont un superbe remix de Criminally insane qui vaut vraiment le détour (solis assassin)."
5,"3eme album de Rubin Steiner (apres Lo fi nu jazz vol 2 et wunderbar 3), Drum major marque une légère evolution pour ce musicien francais. Les influences sont toujours les memes, les instruments egalement (trompette: ""could you spell it""), mais ce qu'il en fait change pas mal, avec notamment un son rock jusqu'à présent inédit sur ses premiers opus ""your life is like a tony conrad concert"". Suit une chanson warpienne avec des triturations dans tous les sens ""schlaffenwagonnet"". LA chanson de l'album, c'est la 4ème ""murderation"", 4 mn de pur bonheur avec son rythme entetant au piano, du pur trip hop à la Bonobo. Suivent ""ten drummers back"", au son rock, malaxé sauce hip hop et ""an introduction to sweet music"", court morceau de transition. Et on arrive tout tranquillement à ""que bonita es la vida"", 7eme chanson de l'album, chantée, une petite merveille aux influences nombreuses (guitare espagnole, maracas...). ""My own style"" et ""universe"" sont également des morceaux de pur trip hop instrumental. Ensuite ""put your horn..."" ressemble à du moby. Et ce tres bon album, aux sonorités bien differentes, mais coherentes, se termine par un morceau que Four Tet n'aurait pas renié ""don't try to copy your heros"" avec la aussi un melange rock trip hop ultra efficace."
1,Ca ressemble vaguement à un mélange entre le remix d'un album des Rubettes et un mauvais concert  de Jean-Michel Jarre. Un album complètement surévalué. Ca devrait toutefois être la BO de votre Prisunic ces 15 prochains jours.
2,"Recueils de faces B, de remixes, de lives ... Oui, en effet, ce pourrait être des faces A. Encore faut-il aimer les ""vraies"" Faces A des Albums ... et si , comme moi, les 3 albums Kid A, Amnesiac et Hail vous ont plus ennuyé qu'enchanté, vous vous ennuierez de la même façon avec ce recueil (voire davantage !)."
5,"Jamais décue par Melissa Etheridge, du 1er album au dernier (the awakening choisir le live avec DVD du concert)tout est à découvrir, réécouter. Dommage qu'elle ne soit pas connue et surtout reconnue en France(Merci les média !!!!!) La plus grande DAME du rock, du blues, sa sensibilité n'a d'égale que la sensualité de sa voix. Speack True, Be strong, Spead the peace."
5,"1979, AC/DC constitue une valeur sûre du Hard Rock. Ses précédents albums, notamment "" High Voltage "" et "" Let There Be Rock "" ont démontré toute la qualité de ce groupe australien. Avec "" Highway to Hell "", Angus Young &amp; Co passent à la vitesse supérieure. Dix titres qui sont devenus par la suite autant de classiques du Hard Rock et même du Rock ( "" Highway to Hell "", "" Girls got rhythm "", "" Beating around the Bush "" ). Considéré par beaucoup comme l'album phare de la discographie d' AC/DC, ce disque restera surtout dans l'histoire, comme le dernier avec son mythique chanteur Bon Scott décédé d'une absorbtion èxagérée d'alcool. Pourtant, le groupe n'en restera pas là puisque l'intégration parfaitement réussie d'un nouveau chanteur: Brian Johnson, donnera naissance à un autre fabuleux album: "" Back in Black ""."
5,"J'ai decouvert par hasard, il y a quelques années, la pianiste Jessica Williams en achetant un disque de Leroy Vinnegar "" "". J'avais été subjugué par la qualité de cette pianiste dont je n'avais jamais remarqué le nom.  On est en présence d'une tres tres grande artiste de jazz. Ces disques sont de qualité (voir  par exemple la critique de "" ""), celui là encore plus. 65 minutes de bonheur par un excellent trio avec Ray Drummond à la basse et Victor Lewis à la batterie.  Ils interprétent essentiellement des compositions de Jessica. C'est fabuleux ! Certaines compositions rendent hommage à des grands du jazz comme Miles Davis(Miles to go) ou D.Gordon (I remember Dexter) ou encore Milt Hinton (The judge).   Pour le sens du rythme, elle a de qui tenir puisqu'elle a fait ses classes avec Philly Joe Jones avant de s'installer à la fin des années 70 à San Francisco où elle a été un certain temps la pianiste attitrée du légendaire club de jazz Keystone Korner. C'est une grande admiratrice Monk, et ce n'est pas un hasard si elle participe pour un morceau au dernier disque de Charlie Rouse en hommage au pianiste ( ), CD au demeurant excellent. Je crois que la plupart des  enregistrements de Mme Williams (une quarantaine sous son nom depuis 1976) sont pour la plupart excellents. Celui ci ou un autre (comme "" "" où elle revisite avec brio 9 standards)  , peu de chances d'être déçu si vous aimez le piano.  Signalons son site ""www.jessicawilliams.com"", tres bien fait, qui permet d'écouter des extraits de ces disques ou de visionner de nombreux extraits de ses concerts.  Amateur de jazz et de bonne musique, faites connaissance au plus vite avec cette grande artiste trop méconnue, vous ne le regretterez pas!"
4,"Cedar Walton est un excellent pianiste hard-bop, cet album de 1967 en est la preuve. Il est ici en trio avec le contrebassiste Leroy Vinnegar et le batteur Billy Higgins, formidable en particulier sur ""My Ship"". Il joue surtout en quartet soit avec le trompettiste Kenny Dorham, ou soit en s'adjoignant le  saxophoniste tenor Junior Cook. Puis en quintet en réunissant les 2 souffleurs. J'avoue préférer les interventions en trio qui sont excellentes: Cedar Walton est fort bien  soutenu et relancé par un fabuleux Billy Higgins. C'est surtout pour eux deux que je recommande ce disque. Ne pas confondre cet album   avec un autre album   (que je ne connais pas) avec un personnel légèrement différent et plus tardif (1985) dans la discographie de Cedar Walton.  Le site Amazon fait malheureusement la confusion entre les deux albums!"
5,"Que du bon... a avoir absolument, avec le coffret 3 cd's de Burt Bacharach « The look of love ». Des mélodies intemporelles et certainement une des plus belle chanson de tous les temps « The look of love », chantée par Dusty Springfield."
4,"Cela aurait du être l'album de la définitive consécration du groupe rock des 90's. Mais cet album est passé inaperçu. Pourtant ""adore"" ""apples+oranges"" et ""17"" par exemple sont des classiques.  A vous de le découvrir, vs ne serez pas déçu!"
2,"Dernier album paru chez Columbia, et pour beaucoup l'album de trop. C'est  kitch, Monk qui eut comme leitmotiv de toujours jouer du Monk, ne joue là plus du Monk. Mieux vaut-il se reporter sur les autres albums en bigband de Monk, il en existe aussi en live. La pochette comme toujours pour celles de monk chez columbia est belle. Mais le contenu??? Néanmoins, mieux vaut il se reporter sur le très bon It's Monk Time chez Columbia à un prix très attractif, et pouvoir apprécier la divine version de Lulu's Back in Town. Ou underground tout aussi bon!  Même à ce prix la c'est décevant!"
5,"Avec sa voix rauque, parfois un peu cassée, mais qui vous atteint directement au coeur, Shirley Horne nous entraîne magnifiquement dans des méandres émotionnels variés, nostalgiques, mélancoliques ou plus légers.  Entre autres plaisirs, un Yesterday à faire revenir au galop vos chagrins d'amour, un Take Love Easy quasi pimpant avec Roy Hargrove, et un If you go away (ne me quitte pas) à tirer des larmes aux crocodiles les plus endurcis. Magique, Shirley !"
5,"Cassandra me plait dans Blue Light 'Til Dawn, New Moon Daughter &amp; Belly Of The Sun.Elle y propose une soul ni R&amp;B,ni gospel mais blues.Elle traite les thèmes blues et de son enfante illegitime pop rock par l'instrumentarium jazz &amp; folk.Dans Thunderbird idem mais sa voix survole un paysage sonore inhabituel: il y a de instruments electriques et electroniques,Go To Mexico,Closer To You,It Would Be So Easy,Poet,Strike A Match sont d'une profonde originalité et modernité avec des reverberations dues à des samples d'instruments de jazz,sur Easy Rider &amp; Red River Valley accompagnée à la guitare electrique elle y est solennelle, bluesy sur  I Want To Be Loved et affectionne depuis toujours la bossa nova Tarot.Une créativité qui marquera (je l'espère)son époque"
5,"cet album est indispensable pour tous ceux qui veulent connaitre errol garner. le morceau ""Avalon"" est en soi un pur chef d'oeuvre de piano."
5,"Parce que Savatage est capable de melanger sur un meme album les rocks les plus hards et les balades les plus emouvantes, parce que La voix de Zach Stevens n'a egale que la guitarre de Criss Oliva, parce que cet album a revele le groupe à la radio, il est indispensable à avoir dans sa collection.  Je vous promets que cet album prend les tripes... peut etre parce que c'est le dernier de Criss ? Quoiqu'il en soit, un moment d'intense emotion."
5,"J'ai découvert Jeff Buckley assez récemment, et je dois avouer qu'au début j'ai eu du mal à l'écouter, car c'est vraiment différent de tout ce que j'ai pu écouter avant, mais plus j'ai écouté, et plus j'ai aimé. Je suis rentrée peu à peu dans son univers, et je suis restée scotchée! Ses chansons sont magiques, intemporelles... la beauté de cet album réside dans toute les émotions qu'il provoque à son écoute. C'est le genre qui vous prend aux tripes et qui vous marque à vie. Jeff Buckley était un grand artiste, et Grace en est (presque) le seul témoignage..."
5,"The Gathering, créateur de ce style musical qui n'est rien d'autre que du métal ""ralenti"" chanté par une belle voix féminine... Chaque morceau est parfaitement équilibré entre des mélodies au piano, des guitares, sans oublier la voix sublime et puissante de la chanteuse. Les textes sont poétiques, portés par une atmosphère lyrique et planante. Les ayant vus plusieurs fois sur scène, je peux vous assurer que c'est un groupe qui sait jouer ce qu'ils font en album (c'est pas toujours le cas pour d'autres ;)"
5,"Une fastueuse cuvée que celle proposée par cet album de Serge gainsbourg, alors au début de sa carrière. En 63, déjà l'homme à la tête de chou fait très fort, et des titres comme Chez les yéyé, La fille au rasoir, Scenic Railway, dévoilent tout le génie de cet artiste d'exception."
5,"Amateurs de piano et de jazz, achetez-le vite ! Le grand Bill Evans dévoile ici son talent ainsi que celui de tout le trio. Pour moi c'est une des plus belles oeuvres d'Evans, toutes les morceaux sont bons mais j'ai vraiment adoré Autumn Leaves, mais écoutez-le vous verrez ! Certains critiqueront la facilité technique des morceaux du pianiste mais ici ce n'est pas cela qui compte mais la beauté des improvisations !"
2,"Joe Henderson est dans une période de relecture : Miles Davis, Gershwin et Billy Strayhorn (comparse de Duke Ellington). Le saxophoniste a un son énorme, majestueux -un des plus beaux- et il est particulièrement bien entouré par de prestigieux musiciens. Il joue dans des configurations variables (du solo au quintet) et la formule est plutôt bien choisie. Tout semble donc parfait et sans doute cela l'est-il un peu trop et le disque produit manque singulièrement de flamme, de passion. Henderson joue de façon finalement réductrice et il ne sort que rarement du style bop qu'il semble aujourd'hui plus particulièrement favoriser. Les compositions interprétés en duo et trio sont les plus intéressantes. Wynton Marsalis est en terrain connu puisque cette période ""mainstream"" est sa tasse de thé et qu'il ressasse dans ce répertoire depuis des années; mais le trompettiste prodige du milieu des années 80 ne semble plus à avoir beaucoup de chose à dire : à force de revister le bop et l'ère swing, il a oublié depuis longtemps d'innover. Un album qui manque de relief mais, à sa décharge, le répertoire joué ne permettait peut-être guère de fantaisie."
5,"Cette album est certainement un des meilleures de Pennywise depuis la mort de Jason (leur ancien chanteur).C'est un disque energique mais pas bourrin :juste ce qu'il faut la ou il faut (voir leur chanson ""ALIEN"")"
5,"Un premier album très réussi!!! Nouveau groupe qui suit le mouvement rapcore (fusion rap/métal), et qui me paraît très prometteur. Les mélodies sont belles, le rap posé avec classe et les cris donnent la pêche aux morceaux. Le groupe est en effet un peu commercial mais a un vrai talent. Les morceaux à ne pas manquer: ""One Step Closer"", ""Points of Authority"", ""By Myself"" et ""Forgotten""."
1,"Dans la trainée des groupes de néo(pseudo)-métal tels que Limp Bizkit et autres Papa Roach est apparu Linkin Park : la poubelle du métal. Denué de toute originalité, ce groupe assomme : des chanteurs à la voix trafiquée, qui hurlent sans saveur ; des piètres guitaristes et un talent de composition plus que douteux. Voilà la recette pour appater les néophytes. Après quelques écoutes, cet album ne pourra plus servir que de cale pour votre lit !"

2,Où est passée la hargne caractéristique de ces excités de Fontainebleau ? Où sont passés les riffs incisifs et les paroles déchirantes ?
2,"Arrivé à la piste 13, j'ai dû m'efforcer à écouter la fin de l'album tant je commençais à le trouver insupportable. Enhancer nous offre trois quarts d'heure d'inoriginalité et de riffs redondants. La seule originalité qui reste à ce groupe est peut-être sa capacité de régresser plutôt que de s'améliorer. Les chanteurs deviennent toujours plus incompréhensibles, les samples sont d'une banalité accablante. Enhancer agit comme un groupe de débutants qui cherchent à imiter plutôt qu'à innover. Cet album me fait hésiter à porter les vêtements Enhancer que j'ai acheté après la sortie du défoulant Et le monde sera meilleur. Le monde peut-être. Pour Enhancer, c'est mal barré."
2,"ça y est, les maisons de disques se sont rendu compte que le néo vendait bien et nous voilà alors ""bombardé"" de ce genre de groupe qui plait tant aux jeunes.  J'avais énormément apprècié le 1er album d'Enhancer, car mis à part les plans ""néo"" hyper connus, il y avait une certaine originalité qui venait s'ajouter au tout. D'ailleurs le son du 1er album était quelque peu ""pourri"", mais je trouve que cela donnait un résultat assez vrai, cru, mais vrai. Là, le son est tout simplement impréssionant, mais c'est tout, il y a peut-être quelques titres qui semblent sympa lors des 1ères écoutes, mais au bout d'une semaine vous en aurez vite fait le tour et ce CD restera alors dans votre CDthèque sans trop jamais vous manquer ..."
2,"...et elle se répète pas mal. Il est certain que ""Meteora"" est un bon album, musclé, défoulant, mais il ne relève certainement pas le niveau de ""Hybrid Theory"". La plupart des compos sont des redites de leur précédent album, à ceci près qu'ils ont cherché cette fois à moins marier les influences (hip-hop, metal, rap...), il en ressort donc un album pêchu, certes, mais assez peu inspiré. Preuve en est, la courte durée du disque (35')...et surtout la répétitivité des titres. A écouter avant d'acheter, car Linkin Park ne fait assurément et définitivement pas partie de ces grands groupes, qui savent se renouveler et se remettre en question..."
2,"Soyons clair : je n'ai absolument rien contre le R&amp;B. Sans être un grand connaisseur, j'apprécie Kelis et certaines autres productions des Neptunes. Cependant, ce disque ne m'a vraiment pas accroché.  J'avais en tête WUZ, avec Gopher, et ce disque en est à mille lieux !! J'attendais peut-être trop de ce disque, présenté comme LE truc electro français du moment (je met à part Air, qui ne joue pas dans le même registre). Il y a biens quelques sons, quelques textures qui m'ont titillées, mais, et je suis vraiment désolé de le dire, rien de trés ""bandant""."
2,"Une affrosité certainement pas, mais comparer cet album, tout comme la plupart avec Phil Collins au chant, aux Foxtrot, Selling england by the Pound, &amp; co, revient à comparer une 2cv à une Ferrari. Oui les chiffres de vente sont montés en flêche avec cette foule de tubes radio mais la qualité musicale a fait le chemin inverse. Passer d'albums progressifs à de la pop, certes efficace et certainement pas mauvaise dans son genre, c'est assuremment une régression. Pour rentrer un peu plus dans les détails, We Can't Dance n'est pas un mauvais album. Il comporte quelques bonnes chansons pop, et certains riffs sont sympas et efficaces. Du Easy Listening en gros. Mais après avoir écouté un épique Supper's Ready ou un bijou classique comme Horizons, difficile de supporter ce genre de choses. Il y a eu Genesis dans les années 70, et il y a eut Genesis après. 2 groupes différents en fait. Le second s'étant transformé par magie en un Phil Collins-Like. En voyant les choses de ce point de vue et seulement comme ça, on peut apprécier ce disque. Moi j'ai beaucoup de mal. Ajoutons quand même que ce virage à 180° n'est pas le seul fait de Phil Collins, mais des autres membres également. Enfin...tout a déjà été dit et redit à ce sujet. C'est comme ça ..."
4,"Voici l'album qui suit le dantesque Youthanasia. Il est clair que pour Dave Mustaine écrire la suite de l'album qui contient le tube ""A tout le monde"" n'a pas du etre facile, mais il s'en sort avec les honneurs. Il a su composé un album encore + mature, tout en y ré-injectant quelques bonnes vieilles recettes de Speed. Ecouter Trust et Use the man (chanson autobiographique sur sa période junkie?), chansons à la fois mélodiques et magnifiquement jouissives par leurs riffs. Et puis FFF avec sa rythmique qui fait étrangement penser à Motorbreath de son ancien groupe Metallica, finira par vous convaincre si vous etes encore sceptique."
5,"On pensait que Billy C. nous avait prodigué le maximum de son génie musical, mais ce dernier opus est d'une excellence époustouflante.  Son plombé dans un magma de guitares et  volontairement ""sali"" du début à la fin, mélodies puissantes, etc...  C'est tout bonnement incroyable, pour ne pas dire presque inclassable. Quelle tristesse de voir ce groupe se saborder après de tels albums de qualité. Rideau !"
2,"Tres bon album des ""Smashing""...enfin c'est ce qu'on veux nous faire croire !!! En fait Mr.Billy Corgan(chanteur) est seul avec J.Chamberlin(batteur)!!! Tous les autres membres ne figurent pas sur l'album! Billy.C à tout enregistré lui meme(basse, guitareS,chant...)sauf la batterie.. Donc , MAIS OU sont les VRAIS Smashing??!! A part ca les compos sont terribles!! GROS POINT NOIR : Le son est reelement super pourri!!!!Quel dommage!! C'est ca de tout vouloir faire tout seul Billy!!T'es bon, mais en musique!! Ingé son, c'est un metier...."
1,"Metallica fut un des plus grands groupes de thrash, sachant digérer ses influences et mêler innovations rythmiques et harmoniques sans sacrifier à la puissance et à la violence du thrash. Ils avaient su inventer leur style. Ils se présentaient aussi comme des rebelles, porte-drapeaux (parfois extrémistes) de l'anti-rock-bizness. Et puis Metallica a vieilli, Mustaine parti depuis longtemps, le grand Cliff, bassiste et musicien génial est mort et Metallica (après l'intéressant &amp; original Justice) a sorti le Black Album (qui n'a même pas de titre en réalité). Une pauvreté musicale affligeante! Un tempo excessivement ramolli et unifié et l'entrée joyeuse et totale dans ce rock-bizness préformaté et conformiste que les Four Hoursemen (le surnom de faux rebelles qu'ils se donnaient) prétendaient haïr. Cet album est un enterrement. Metallica est mort avec ce disque. Car ce ne fut pas un accident de parcours mais le début d'une longue suite d'impostures, de CD musicalement pauvres, lents et mous, antithèses de thrash, formatés marketing avec la complicité du glammer Bob Rock (sic! trop drôle le surnom!) producteur de BonJovi (dont Metallica s'était souvent moqué auparavant!). Si comme moi vous avez adoré la richesse et la force des 4 précédents opus, oubliez ce CD et tous les suivants. J'ai pu l'écouter 3 fois en entier, pas 1 de plus, avec à chaque fois plus de déception, plus de mal à aller au bout et plus de tristesse quant à ce terrible constat : cet album est indigne de son nom. Par contre si vous avez découvert Metallica plus tard, il vous plaira peut-être. Cela dit j'ai mis une étoile, parce qu'on ne pouvait pas mettre moins à cet album long, lent, vide, monotone, pénible qui, s'il n'est plus du tout du thrash n'est même pas du bon heavy metal.Même le titre et la pochette sont nuls et brillent par leur absence. Cet album n'a pas plus de titre que d'inspiration. Cliff reviens leur botter le cul (""we're gonna kick some ass tonight"" qu'ils disaient! quelle ironie! Où comment passer du Thrash au trash. NB : trash sans h = poubelle en ricain)"
2,"Je ne sais pas quoi penser de cet album. Longtemps il ne m'a pas interessé, et la période 70's du groupe n'était pas ma préférée. Entre temps, je me suis plongé dedans, et j'ai appris à l'apprécier, mais ce Lonesome Crow me laisse toujours froid. Ambiance planante et assez baba cool, ce n'est pas ma tasse de thé, même si le talent et la voix de Meine sont déjà là. Pas désagréable, mais je suis peut-être trop metalleux dans l'ame pour apprécier cette musique à sa juste valeur."
5,"Une véritable tuerie qu'est cet album et qui s'inscrit comme leur meilleur album avec Generator.  17 chansons d'une incroyable qualité et des paroles tres profondes ( Against The Grain, Unacceptable .... )  A tout posséder si vous êtes fans de "" VRAI "" punk-rock. :)"
1,"Minable, déplorable, intolérable. Bref, les adjectifs ne manquent pas pour déplorer la nullité de cet album. Comment un groupe comme Métallica peut sortir un album pareil. Le son est archi-nul, la batterie est bidon, la basse est molle, et les solos ne sont plus là. Aaaah! Qu'il est loin le temps de Master of Puppets, ou du Black album. C'est une honte, cet album. Pourquoi une étoile, alors? Parceque malgré tout, c'est Métallica, et qu'il ne faut pas renier leur grand temps, à la fin des années 80, et début des années 90."
1,"Je ne donne ici que mon avis personnel. Pour moi cet album est lamentable. Ce n'est plus le meme groupe. Kirk Hammet a perdu ses competences de guitaristes (pas un seul solo ...), la batterie est pourrie et couvre tout, la production pitoyable (enregistré dans des toilettes ?). Les chansons sont banales, Le chanteur James Hetfeild est ridicule (ecoutez le crier kill kill kill à la fin du dernier morceau), les riffs sans aucune originalité, les morceaux longs mais répétitifs au possible (toujours les meme parties qui reviennent). Il n'y a aucune réele mélodie, l'album est lassant, et on est bien loin de la complexité de And justice for all par exemple. Pour finir, je dirais qu'il copient les groupes qu'ils ont eux meme inflencé, ce qui deçoit pour un groupe si mythique. Le mythe est mort. Enfin esperons que le prochain sera un réel retour aux sources, et vous pouvez toujours vous reporter sur les premiers albums, vous ne serez pas deçus."
1,"Cet album peut se resumer assez facilement: une intro de guitare, accordee tres bas pour donner plus de peche a des riffs sans imagination, la batterie qui rentre, puis la suite, ennuyeuse, avec des couplets a peine chantes. Tout se ressemble, rien ne se distingue, a part la tres bonne chanson qui a donne son titre a l'album, et qui est l'unique satisfaction (meme la pochette est a vomir). Mention particuliere au son de caisse claire, qui sonne tellement comme une casserole qu'on la croirait empruntee a Maite. Dommage que Metallica finisse comme ca."
1,"où sont les boys de metallica? le son est affreux, james htfield a perdu sa voix et la batterie de lars ulrich a été remplaçée par des casseroles... cet album qui semble plaire aux fans de load et reload decevra les fans de la premiere heure comme moi, qui n'apprécient pas que metallica fasse du nu-metal"
1,"J'adore les types qui disent : ""cet album je l'ai trouvé nul au départ, mais finalement, après 2000 écoutes, je l'apprécie..."". Soyons sérieux : si on vous fait écouter du Céline Dion 24h/24h, il y a quand même de grandes chances pour que vos références soient modifiées pronfondément et que vous vous mettiez à aimer de la daube ;) Là où le bat blesse, c'est quand on réécoute les fondamentaux 'Master of Puppets' et '...And Justice For All'. En comparant, on ne peut que se rendre à l'évidence : cet album c'est de la merde en boite ! Il n'est pas au niveau de ses prédecesseurs et ne le sera jamais ! ...même au bout de 5000 écoutes... La règle : toujours se fier à ses premières impressions, et, pour ma part, j'ai écouté cet album 3 fois, et ça a été une souffrance sans nom, souffrance qui s'évaporait comme par magie quand j'écoutais 'Orion', ou 'Sanatarium'... Si ça, c'est pas un signe..."
1,"A la question de savoir si vous écoutez Metallica, répondez que vous avez arrêté à ""Kill'em all"" !"
1,"un album honteux, avec un pseudo son garage. Ils veulent faire les méchants underground, alors qu'on sait tous que Metallica, c'est devenu Bisounours chez la Jet Set. Les morceaux sont inutilement longs (8 min pour deux riffs et un refrain). La seule piste que j'ai trouvé intéressante était d'éliminer les solos, mais en fait c'est pire. Des paroles d'ados enfermés dans leur chambre. Attendre pour ça! en plus le DVD est d'une inutilité alarmante à l'heure où on nous bombarde de faux collector pour nous faire claquer plus de fric pour de la simple merde sans odeur."
5,"Cette musique est vraiment à la hauteur du film, pour l'atmosphère et l'effet qu'elle crée. On dirait que le son sort directement de l'esprit tordu et tourmenté du héros! ++ Ce qui m'énerve un peu, beaucoup, c'est qu'on l'entends très souvent en fond dans les reportages tv débiles, ça gâche un peu!!"
1,"En 10 ans et après 3 albums médiocres, le Sepultura version Greene n'a pas convaincu. Le groupe est redevenu un groupe de seconde zone qui n'intéresse plus personne ou presque. Et au moment où les rumeurs de reformation avec Max Cavalera sont de plus en plus fortes, on ne s'attendait même pas à voir un nouvel album du groupe dans cette configuration. Et quel album ambitieux puisque ce nouvel album est une retranscription moderne du célèbre poème de Dante, ""La Divine Comédie"". Dès l'introduction, l'ambiance est oppressante, rappelons que dans le livre en question, l'auteur évoque sa descente aux enfers, le purgatoire et son accession au paradis. Les orchestrations donnent un côté malsain aux titres. L'ambiance générale est oppressante, certains titres sont même difficiles à écouter en entier. Franchement, cet album est horrible et le chant insupportable. Aucun titre ne sauve l'album de la médiocrité, Dante XXI est une bouillie sonore. Ah si, le meilleur titre est l'instrumental ""Still Flame"", parce qu'on y entend pas le chanteur hurler et aussi parce que c'est le dernier. Et dire que le guitariste Andreas Kisser a osé comparer cet album au Reign In Blood de Slayer lors de ses dernières  interviews. Je me rappelle qu'à la sortie de The Burning Red, Machine Head avait annoncé la même chose. C'est un peu ridicule, surtout quand l'album est mauvais derrière. Allez, on attend le retour de Max..."
5,"L'univers de Dionysos est toujours aussi magique... On y entre par la petite porte des fées et on découvre un monde à part... Une version musicale d'un univers Burtonnien (Big Fish serait un bon exemple!), J'ADORE! Faites vous plaisir!"
5,"Phil Collins, en plus d'être le leader de genesis, fut un grand batteur de jazz-rock de la fin des années 70 au début des années 80. Ensuite et malheureusement, il a quelque peu abandonné le genre au profit d'une soul funk qui a vite viré à la variété gluante (à partir de ""No jacket Required"", si l'on veut bien être compréhensif voire ouvert à ses deux premiers efforts solos). Bref, ce live de Brand X le démontre avec sa participation à une musique inventive, intelligente et surtout pas empesée comme peut parfois l'être le genre dit ""jazz rock"". Cet album mérite largement le détour."
5,"Je me permets d'écrire un p'tit commentaire, parce que quand même, lire que la voix d'Antony est aussi reconnaissable que celle de Jimmy Summerville, ça ne me plait pas trop. Enfin tout de même, la voix d'Antony Hegarty est reconnaissable entre mille tellement elle est énivrante et puissante. Rien à voir avec un Jimmy Summerville, pourquoi pas Patrick Hernandez ? Bref, en dehors de cette remarque, les nouvelles aventures d'Antony, après celles qui l'ont unies aux Johnsons, sont encore plus sympathiques. C'est beaucoup moins mélancoliques qu'avant, la voix est en place, les sons sont intéressants, rythmés, entraînants. Jetez un petit coup d'oeil aux paroles tout de même à l'occasion."
5,"Vous qui aimez Calexico, Friends of Dean Martinez, qui regardez les films de Clint Eastwood et Sergio Leone en boucles depuis votre plus tendre enfance : ne râtez pas ce grand disque, d'une profonduer troublante. Howe Gelb est au-dessus de la mêlée, un grand artiste sans concession, qui réussit à faire des chansons rustiques d'une grande sophistication. Gelb écrit des chansons de country, de jazz, de rock, toujours élégantes, profondes et poétiques. Le label Thrill Jockey (Tortoise, Isotope 217) ne s'y est pas trompé. La source inespérée de Tucson n'a pas fini de livrer ses trésors."
5,"Que voilà une compile bien sympathique et bienvenue qui vous emmène à la découverte des musiques nouvelles d'une diaspora multimillénaire. Point de communautarisme, que du contraire, car en voyageant entre electronica aux saveurs orientales ou latines, lounge ensoleillée et balkan-break-beat ce joli patchwork musical résolument actuel, futuriste, démontre la richesses et l'ouverture d'une Culture trop souvent méconnue, toute la sensualité d'une langue matriarcale. Heureuse rencontre de traditions, de saveurs glanées à travers l'espace et le temps, d'innovations et toujours avec cet imparable sens de l'humour, de l'autodérision, oi oi oi ! (Don Olivero)"
1,"Si vous comparez celui-ci avec ses albums français,vous allez être très surpris...il n'y a que les chansons banales...Dommage!"
5,"Si d'emblé l'on remarque que l'album porte le nom d'un fromage , penchons nous aussitôt sur son goût . En premier lieu , parti rejoindre Sinner , Saxon se voie dans l'obligation de recruter un nouveau Batteur . L'intérim n'est autre que le batteur de Stratovarius , et à tout prendre , le groupe n'y perd pas au change ... Ca martelle en effet sévère . ""Lionheart"" est une nouvelle fois un très bon album de Saxon . Mais , est ce le fait qu'ils aient eu du mal à canaliser l'énergie de ce fou furieux de batteur ? , toujours est-t-il que la musique du groupe tend parfois à s'éparpiller un peu en sûr jouant plus que de raison . Un faux plis qui s'accentura encore d'avantage sur l'album suivant . Pour l'instant , Byford et sa bande ne tombent pas si souvent dans les travers de la sûr enchère , et nous offre notre ratio de métal épique , entre modernité et tradition .  Si l'illustration classique de la pochette demeure superbe , on regrettera dans l'édition digipack , un manque flagrant d'esthétisme (heureusement comblé par la présence d'un splendide Patch brodé : Comme au bon vieux temps du vinyl , des vestes à franges , et autres badges faisant office de look ultime pour le parfait Hardos (c'est mieux que métaleeuux) que nous étions , il y a ...) . 17/20"
2,"Soit , lorsque cet album est sorti , le métal prog n'en était encore qu'à ses premiers balbutiements . Certains ( mal informés ) ont prétendu que DT avait inventé ce nouveau genre de musique qui est un savant mélange de métal et de prog ( qui l'eut cru ? ) . Bien évidemment , il n'en est rien ( voire Crimson glory ou Watchtower par exemple ) . On parlera donc de DT comme le groupe qui a largement popularisé ce style de musique .  En termes de qualité , l'album ""Images and words"" est moins bon que le suivant (""Awake"") et il est nettement inférieur à ""Metropolis: Songs from a memory"" , il n'est donc certainement pas le meilleur . En revanche , il est assez ""commercial"" dans la démarche et à mes yeux probablement le mieux formaté pour séduire un large public . Pour ma part , je ne l'écoute quasiment plus car je trouve les compositions assez plates , à l'exception de 2 ou 3 , dont le morceau très court composé par le talentueux et regretté K.Moore .  ""Images and words"" est donc un album qui a permis de populariser le prog métal et d'ouvrir la voie à pas mal d'autres formations mais il ne mérite absolument pas le qualificatif de chef-d'oeuvre que quelques-uns ont utilisé un peu hâtivement à son sujet !"
5,"Faut-il considérer Steve Vai comme un humain ou comme un alien qui adore les secrets? C'est hallucinant à quel point ce surdoué de la guitare (ou de la musique tout court) est fou. Cependant, qu'est-ce que c'est bon! Ce disque où se cotoient metal purement heavy (There's a fire in the house, Little alligator), rock psyché à donf (The crying machine, Bangkok), des délires musicaux ultimes (When i was a little boy, Fire garden suite), des ballades sublimes (Brother, All about Eve)et bien sûr des parties de guitares qui dégouteraient n'importe quel petit débutant (Blowfish, Warm regards). Ce type est un génie digne de on mentor Zappa, un artiste dont la créativité semble sans limite et qui meriterait qu'un peu plus de monde s'interesse à lui."
5,"Vulcain est un groupe de Hard Rock français fondé en 1981 et qui a stoppé sa carrière en 1998, après 1 démo, 7 album studio, 1 E.P., 2 live et une compil. Avec Rock'N'Roll Secours, son premier album paru en 1984, Vulcain, considéré comme le ""Motörhead français"" (on pourra remarquer notamment la voix de Daniel Puzio et la basse de son frère Vincent sur certains passages, qui rappellent le groupe anglais), a frappé un très grand coup en réalisant l'album que je considère comme étant leur meilleur, une baffe monumentale avec des titres puissants et intenses ! Les compositions sont particulièrement efficaces et taillées pour la scène (j'en garde un fantastique souvenir, d'autant que c'est le premier groupe que j'ai vu en concert, après la sortie de cet album). Cette réédition propose l'album remasterisé avec l'E.P. La Dame De Fer inclu. Inutile d'ajouter qu'il est indispensable pour tous ceux qui aiment le genre ! Pendant les années 80, j'ai fortement apprécié, en concert ou sur album, toute cette génération de groupes français de grande qualité, dont Vulcain était l'un des dignes représentants (Trust, Blasphème, Warning, Killers, Satan Jokers, Attentat Rock, Demon Eyes, Sortilège, H Bomb, ADX...), et dont certains sont encore en activité aujourd'hui !  C'est d'ailleurs bien volontiers et avec plaisir que j'écoute encore des albums de ces groupes de temps à autre ! Notons pour finir que Daniel Puzio est revenu en 2008, dix ans après Stoppe La Machine (le dernier album de Vulcain) avec un nouveau groupe, Mr Jack, accompagné de deux ex H Bomb."
1,"Depuis ses histoites d'amour avec son infirmière, j'ai vu évoluer cette chanteuse vers la Starification...Une sous-Madonna qui abreuve ses fans d'une musique insipide dont elle n'est pas l'auteur.  Avec ce nouvel Opus ""Point de suture"" Mylène n'est pas sur le point de racommoder la Musique française. Les orchestrations style orgue bontempi   (spécial dédicace à rockin-jl) rendent son succès incompréhensible.  Y a t il une fréquence Vaudou (concept de George Clinton) comme dans la malédiction des chanteurs de Funk (Jesse johnson, Rick James..) ? Oui mais ici la calamité c'est la chanteuse elle-même."
5,"Paradoxalement, ce CD vaut surtout pour son ""bonus"", la sonate n°2 interprétée par Emil Gilels. Certes, Ormandy ne démérite pas, et son orchestre est somptueux. Mais la sonate révèle un Gilels au sommet de son art, à la fois sobre, puissant, délicat et méditatif, tandis que la partition constitue un monument pianistique du XXe siècle étrangement méconnu."

2,"C'est ça que tant de monde attend ? En écoute depuis peu sur leur site, cet album à la pochette comique est exactement ce qu'on attendait de ce groupe POPulaire. A la repompe plate de radiohead et U2 on peut ajouter maintenant l'intégralité des groupes pop depuis 20 ans. coldplay se fait un objectif de reprendre tout ce qui a marché sans rien y apporter : les cuivres, la musique orientale, les cordes, l'électro, tout ça est digéré et remodelé pour le plus grand nombre. Bien conscient que la musique n'est qu'une histoire de reprises et de variations sur le même thème, il faudra tout de même se rendre compte que coldplay est un groupe qui n'apporte pas grand chose. Au plus certains fans se tourneront vers les groupes qui les ont inspirés, découvrant alors ce qu'est la musique... A leur crédit on peut dire aussi que c'est plus agréable d'être matraqué à la radio par coldplay que par beaucoup d'autres. Euh, voilà..."
1,"Il s'agit là d'une grosse production américaine ou le talent du producteur et la thune de la maison de disque priment par rapport au talent des musiciens, qui est d'ailleurs ici quasiment inexistant. Le premier album etait encore assez original, mais là on a vraiment l'impression d'écouter de la variette. Désolé pour les fans mais vous n'avez rien capter: c'est pas de la musique mais de la soupe commerciale."
2,"David y voulait pas , pi finalement il a dit oui , pourquoi ? . ""Restless heart"" à promouvoir , la pression commercial des pontes du marketing , l'envie de tuer l'temps , ou juste le plaisir d'un nouvel exercice ... On ne le saura pas et c'est sans importance . Toujours est-t-il que le beau blond , soudainement chatain ( l'absence de lumière sans doute ) et les cheveux mi long , nous offre sur ce Live ( Show case plutôt ) acoustique 10 morceaux dépouillés de tous arrangements aussi courts que les ""douilles"" du chanteur . Décidemment tout fout le camp . Si au départ ce type d'exercice pouvait s'avérer tout à fait louable de la part de nos deux duellistes , le résultat s'avère vite d'un ennui mortel . Rien ne décolle vraiment , et seule la petite assemblée présente semble y trouver son compte . On sent que cette parenthèse (pas enchantée du tout) n'a pas été assez préparé de la part du duo . Bâclé si l'on préfère . Il en résulte une interprétation très en deçà de ce que l'on était en droit d'espérer de la part du Ténor . On retiendra quand même que certains standards prennent ici une couleur toute particulière ... C'est la moindre des choses . 7/20"
5,"Ce disque illustre de façon magistrale la meilleure période du blues anglais. Evidemment Howlin'Wolf, comme John Lee Hooker, Luther Allison, BB King... est l'un des plus emblématiques représentants du blues traditionnel américain, mais sa musique appuyée par les meilleurs musiciens anglais de l'époque, prend une dimension extraordinaire. La présence d'Eric Clapton et de Hubert Sumlin aux guitares, de Stevie Winwood au claviers mais surtout l'extraordinaire section rythmique Rolling Stonienne (Bill Wyman, Charlie Watts, Ian Stewart) fait de cet enregistrement un incontournable."
2,"McCartney, mélodiste génial, capable d'aligner trois ou quatre merveilles sur CHAQUE disque des Beatles ... Elles sont où, les bonnes chansons sur « Ram » ? La soi-disant meilleure du lot, « Uncle Albert Admiral Halsey », comptine enfantine de seconde zone, ne fait que recycler les plans de « Ob-la-di Ob-la-da ». « Long haired lady » avec son final qui lorgne sur celui de « Hey Jude » ne fait que traduire un manque d'inspiration évident. Et comment une oreille aussi experte, subtile et avisée que celle de Paul a-t-elle pu laisser passer au mixage les chœurs ineptes de sa Linda de femme ? Les mystères de l'amour sont insondables ... Seuls pour moi, les deux titres les plus énervés du lot, « Smile away » et « Monkberry moon delight », réussissent à sauver « Ram » du naufrage total. Qui reste un Cd indigne du talent (énorme) de McCartney. Précipitez-vous plutôt sur « Band on the run », paru trois ans plus tard, où Paulo est au niveau qui est le sien, au sommet."
1,"Vous etes simple amateur de Queen? Passez votre chemin. Cet album a toujours eut une mauvaise réputation, et hélas, en l'ecoutant, on ecoute un disque pop des années 80. Rien qui fait vraiment ""Queen""... Sans doute les fans, possedant la discographie integrale, trouveront un interet a ce disque, mais en amateur a peine eclairer, je n'ai vraiment pas accroché."
4,à posséder pour tous les fans de speed metal symphonique! ce cd est envoutant sur un rytme soutenu qui a la particularité de nous transporter. Dommage qu'il n'y a que 2 cd!! C'est la suite des 2 volets précédents. En espérant qu'HELLOWEEN poursuive dans cette voix.
5,"Voilà la toute première bande originale de Tangerine dream: Sorcerer. Cet B.O est magnifique est très bien fait, il faut dire que la musique ne donne pas une ambiance bien joyeuse mais elle va bien avec le film."
5,"Voici le coffret réunissant les premiers albums du groupe de Lou Reed qui révolutionna le rock en plein millieu des 60's, dont le premier (The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico) est sans doute l'un des meilleurs album de tout les temps, toutes catégories confondues. Plus un premier disc qui contient les essais du groupe et plein de chansons inédites sur chaques autres disc. Un achat  indispensable."
5,"un disque a découvrir absolument, un grand artiste est né!!il suffit de fermer les yeux et de se laisser entrainer dans ses récits..."
1,"Inécoutable ! Qu'on aime ou pas la qualité des textes, subir ne serait ce que 5 minutes de ce disque relève du défi. Le tube d'aspirine est vivement recommandé. Ca s'appelle le ""slam"", une sorte de ""poésie"", débitée, débitée et débitée. Très peu d'arrangements, voix monocorde, voilà le programme. Un genre qui restera le plus underground possible, du moins je le souhaite."
2,"Gary Moore a la patate et un gros son, d'autres pensent que c'est une patate et un gros con. Parfois j'hésite, par exemple j'avais assez aimé ses derniers disques (Blues For Greenie en 1995 hommage à Peter Green et Old New Ballads Blues en 2006) ils étaient gorgés de ce blues musclé que je prise ponctués de ces titres lents où la guitare miaule comme une chatte en chaleur, ou pleure comme un boulanger ayant perdu sa Pomponette. C'est parfois un peu trop facile et du domaine du cliché ce qui lui vaut des critiques, c'est aussi ce que je lui reprocherais à l'écoute de ce nouvel album. Des morceaux un peu faibles, certains titres qui tapent un peu trop fort à mon goût et des évidences guitaristiques entendues mille fois sur ses albums précédents. Sinon c'est toujours pêchu et on ne risque pas de s'endormir tant que le CD tourne sur la platine. Pour cette fois je passe mon tour."
2,"autant je reste amateur du brooks&amp; dunn des annees 90(je conseille d'ailleur fortement leur greatest hits 1 de 1997)autant je suis alergique au b&amp;d du 21 eme siecle.album apres album ca se degrade,ca ressemble de plus en plus a de la variete,d'ailleur leur musique me fait penser aux bellamy brother,on a meme droit a la presence de sheryl crow et vince gill se qui confirme cette orientation pop,variete.a quand un duo avec johnny halliday tant que l'on y est."
1,"Eh ben... autant j'aime Pink Floyd après Waters comme avant Waters... autant je trouve totalement décevant ce double live ! Si la tournée a été un très grand succès, à mon avis le montage de ce double album a été fait en choisissant les pires moments de la tournée ! A se demander s'ils n'ont pas voulu sortir un ""bêtisier de la carrière de Pink Floyd"" ! Je suis convaincu qu'il y a dans les bandes son de cette tournée des prises infiniment meilleures que celles qui ont été sélectionnées pour sortir ce live. Le son est atroce, les musiciens ne sont pas synchro entre eux, dans Money le batteur est complètement dans le potage, tout au long du concert on entend plusieurs fois des impros complètement hors sujet d'un guitariste accompagnateur PENDANT des solos de Gilmour (qui a du grincer plusieurs fois des dents !), on a même parfois l'impression qu'ils n'ont carrément pas répété avant de monter sur scène, par moments on se demande même si le morceau ne va pas tomber en rideau avant la fin... voire s'ils ne vont pas carrément arrêter le concert (l'interprétation d'Another Brick in the Wall se termine en un véritable flop désastreux)... Les solos de Gilmour restent excellents mais dès la deuxième demi-heure on sent déjà à son toucher qu'il a compris que ça ne sera pas un bon concert et qu'il va se contenter de faire ""au mieux"" pour tenter de faire oublier le désastre qui se joue derrière lui, et mis à part lui... le bassiste et le saxophoniste semblent être les seuls autres musiciens de vraiment bonne qualité sur cette scène ! En fait on a l'impression durant tout l'album d'entendre un concert fait par de mauvais amateurs voulant tenter de jouer du Pink Floyd ! Seuls quelques intros et deux ou trois morceaux épars m'ont vraiment accroché au point d'y retrouver le vrai Pink Floyd de Gilmour. On est loin, très loin... à des années-lumière de la qualité technique et artistique de Pulse ! J'aimerai toujours Pink Floyd, que ce soit avec ou sans Waters (ce sont deux époques différentes dans la vie du groupe et Gilmour a réussi un coup de force admirable après le départ de Waters, tout comme Collins avait à la même époque réussi le pari tout aussi difficile de reprendre Genesis après le départ de Gabriel)... mais franchement cet album, je le range dans un fond de tiroir pour probablement l'oublier définitivement. J'ai mis 5 étoiles sur TOUS les autres albums de Pink Floyd... et celui-ci est vraiment une incroyable exception : une seule pauvre étoile !"
1,"Ce live n'est en aucun cas issu de tapes 1st gen comme assuré par les 3 doors restants. Les masters sont en la possession de Peter Abrams, patron du MAtrix et qui a enregistré deux soirs de concert sur trois, lequel n'a pas pu trouver d'arrangement financier avec les Doors (pure cupidité des membres restants ! )  Pour avoir pu comparer des extraits de ces master tapes et écouté ce double live : pas de comparaison possible : le son sur ce live n'est pas digne du pire des bootlegs en circulation, alors que le matériau original est fantastique ! Il ne sera certainement jamais réalisé pour le public... une honte !  Passez votre chemin et souvenez-vous : Money beats soul every time"
2,"Alors que le groupe affichait fièrement sa singularité et son mépris des aspects commerciaux sur Acquiring the Taste (1971), il choisit pour sa première sortie américaine de faire marche arrière vers un rock progressif plus consensuel. La sauvagerie hard rock jubilatoire des deux premiers albums disparait ainsi presque totalement au profit d'une musique plus sage et accommodante privilégiant le ramollissement des déclinaisons jazzy. Gentle Giant se recentre sur une instrumentation plus conventionnelle, privilégiant guitares et claviers et délaissant quelque peu la valse des cordes et cuivres ainsi que la plupart des élans médiévaux. En se pliant aux règles fixées par les grosses pointures du genre, le collectif se prive de cet effet de surprise qui lui procurait une grande partie de son charme. Dans l'espoir d'être enfin reconnu par le milieu, il reste à procéder à la touche séductrice finale, très en vogue à l'époque : masquer l'insuffisance musicale par la poudre aux yeux de l'album concept. Three Friends est ainsi présenté comme une fable sociale s'attardant sur les destins très divergents de trois vieux copains d'école. L'ouvrier plein d'amertume (""Working All Day""), l'artiste peintre psychotique et culpabilisé (""Peel the Paint"") et le businessman vantant son mérite (""Mister Class and Quality?"") ne doivent pas faire oublier que le producteur Tony Visconti n'est plus de la partie. Cet espace de liberté octroyé survient malheureusement au mauvais moment, laissant les musiciens freiner sans retenue leur excentricité.  Bien que toujours immédiatement reconnaissable, la musique de Gentle Giant apparait donc ici contrariée, ramollie, comme émanant d'un espace confiné. Malgré les divers et maladroits artifices de studio réverbérants, les musiciens semblent prisonniers, incapables de se libérer de cette véritable camisole qu'ils se sont infligée. Même les efforts les plus musclés comme ""Working All Day"" manquent gravement de vivacité, ce dernier dévoilant de plus un riff trop grossier pour passionner. Les passages plus symphoniques et orchestraux peinent à prendre l'ampleur nécessaire à leur rayonnement. Dans sa première partie, ""Peel the Paint"" en est la parfaite illustration avant d'évoluer vers un déluge jazzy musclé bien plus attrayant. Cette seconde portion et son solo de guitare ravageur constituent d'ailleurs un des seuls passages mémorables de ce Three Friends. A cette courte réjouissance s'ajoutent celles de ""Mister Class and Quality?"" malgré sa simplicité et son dynamisme laborieux, ainsi que la seconde moitié du titre éponyme où le groupe semble enfin sur le point de décoller vers une symphonie poignante, trop tard malheureusement. Si les sacrifices artistiques sont parfois nécessaires à la survie d'un groupe, Gentle Giant s'y emploie ici à la perfection. Dès sa sortie, Three Friends séduit une part plus large des amateurs de rock progressif, ce qui permet au groupe d'entamer une tournée européenne. Cet album concept musicalement décevant est ainsi avant tout à considérer comme un disque utilitaire, par lequel Gentle Giant se plie aux conventions finalement très restrictives d'un public qui prétendra toujours ne pas en avoir..."

5,"Un petit joyau d'un des groupes phare de la pop des années 1980. Il y a bien sûr Bohemian Rhapsody, popularisé à juste titre par le film Wayne's World, mais également d'autres merveilles : Love Of My Life, You're My Best Friend... La construction est remarquable, un peu à la façon d'un opéra, avec alternance des passages rapides et lents : voix de tous les membres du groupe, voire démultiplication sur certains passages pour les choeurs. Enfin, la guitare électrisante de Brian arrive à nous faire vibrer juste au bon moment. Un album mythique, un opéra moderne réussi. La galette a même bénéficié d'un remaster, et le résultat dépasse de loin mon vieux vinyl."
2,"Préférant une fois de plus un album live simple au profit d'un double, moins réducteur, la maison de disques de JJG saborde un projet pourtant intéressant : faire profiter les fans de la mise en trio de chansons uniquement chantées par Jean Jacques Goldman. Déjà handicapé par ce choix, l'album souffre d'un autre problème : sept chansons figurent sur le dernier disque studio en date. Pour les ""rescapés"" des années 80, ""A Quoi Tu Sers"", ""Là-Bas"", ""Il Suffira D'Un Signe"" et ""Je Commence Demain"" tentent de combler le manque. Audacieusement emballé dans un boitier en fer, le disque commence pourtant bien avec une splendide version de ""Nuit"" à l'introduction allongée. ""Peurs"" tire également son épingle du jeu, alors qu'il est assez méconnu du grand public, mais les autres chansons de l'album ""Fredericks Goldman Jones"" ne parviennent pas à être dynamisées pour prendre un nouvel essor malgré un public conquis à l'avance. ""Je Commence Demain"" s'étire avec une introduction rock n' roll du meilleur effet, cisaillé en son centre par une intervention aussi curieuse qu'amusante d'un JJG pourtant timide, tandis que le single ""Il Suffira D'Un Signe"", dans cette version en concert, ne rend pas hommage à la version originale de ce titre. Je trouve cet album live très bancal donc. N'ayant pas spécialement apprécié le dernier disque studio en date, j'espérais que les versions en concert me permettraient d'avoir un regard neuf pour éventuellement apprécier les nouvelles chansons, mais il n'en est rien. Dommage"
2,"Desole, mais je n'appellerais pas cet album l'album de l'année!(il faudra voir pour du grand metal du cote de Slayer mais bon..) Les riffs de cet album sont du copier-coller de Morbid Angel, Cannibal Corpse et autres Nile et le batteur ne fait plus que du blast beat en essayant d'imiter de tres bons batteurs. Bref,on notera quand meme un bon son,et qques bonnes idees sur qques chansons(people=shit,the shape,heretic anthem ou skin ticket) mais guere plus car ces messieurs de slipknot ne brillent pas par leur originalite! Bref,beaucoup de bruit pour rien."
2,"Arrivé à la piste 13, j'ai dû m'efforcer à écouter la fin de l'album tant je commençais à le trouver insupportable. Enhancer nous offre trois quarts d'heure d'inoriginalité et de riffs redondants. La seule originalité qui reste à ce groupe est peut-être sa capacité de régresser plutôt que de s'améliorer. Les chanteurs deviennent toujours plus incompréhensibles, les samples sont d'une banalité accablante. Enhancer agit comme un groupe de débutants qui cherchent à imiter plutôt qu'à innover. Cet album me fait hésiter à porter les vêtements Enhancer que j'ai acheté après la sortie du défoulant Et le monde sera meilleur. Le monde peut-être. Pour Enhancer, c'est mal barré."
4,"bcp plus calme que le precedent, mais certainement plus intense, cet album est celui de la maturite pour un groupe qui, jusqu'à present était resté tres fougueux. ""De cercle en cercle"" s'impose naturellement comme une reflexion sur leur avenir musical. A acheter d'urgence pour les fans et non-fans."
2,"J'ai beaucoup aimé SEVAS TRA, à peine moins HOUSE OF SECRETS, mais là... OTEP a perdu tout ce qui faisait de lui un groupe à part, sa rage, sa hargne, sa violence tant dans les compos que dans les paroles, il suffit d'écouter le single Ghostflowers pour s'en rendre compte... Amateurs du OTEP bien bourrin, passez votre chemin..."
1,"Le départ de Chris De Garmo de queensryche ne s'est pas fait sans trace. la preuve, cet album insipide et plat que nous livre Queensryche après toutes ces années d'excellence pure. Q2K, avec ses 11 chansons, perd toute l'essence qui caractérisait Q. depuis le début. sqeule l'impérial ""the Right Side of my Mind"" y reprend le flambeau sacré du quintet de Seattle. Je suis très très déçu par ce groupe que je considérais comme ayant ""la classe et le style""... quel dommage ! Et pourtant je vénère tous les autres albums..."
5,"Marylin Manson et son gothisme exacerbé, encore un album qui ne parle que de sang, de mort, d'injustice, malgré tout moins violent que certains précédents et pourtant toujours aussi envoûtant... La dernière chanson est frissonante et la 15ème (coma black) peuvent donner un aperçu de la déprime de cet album qu'on écoutera pourtant sans discontinuer, grâce à la rage et à la beauté obscure qu'il dégage."
5,"Je ne puis trouver les mots qualifiants ce cd géant tant la musique et bonne. Certaines mauvaises langues diront que quelques chansons ressemblent quelques peu aux versions précèdentes mais vraiment je ne vois vraiment pas ce qu'il y aurait à redire sur ce chef d'oeuvre musical.Et ce que je ferais remarquer avant tout, c'est le peu de gachis présent sur ce dernier cd. C'est bien simple tout est bon. Donc je vous le conseille vivement!"
4,"Après son brillant retour en 1969 à Las Vegas, Elvis y retourna régulièrement entre 1970 et 1976 pour faire des série de représentation."
2,"Il fallait osé avec un son brésilien reprendre les paroles de Niravana mais pour moi la sauce ne prend pas, même si je suis tout a fait respectueux de ce grand artiste"
5,"cet album est tout simplement magique. A tous les fans de Bob Dylan, jetez vous sur cet album où harmonica, guitare acoustique et une voix d'or se mêlent pour vous emmener dans un autre monde. Une recette simple et excellente. Aussi bien à écouter fort qu'en musique de fond, pour s'endormir. Mike Scott est un surdoué de la musique. Je vous le conseille les yeux fermés et de suite."
5,"Ce petit chef-d'oeuvre sorti en 1995, marque le retour d'un des meilleurs songwriters de l'americana,après une période agitée pour notre homme, dope et incarcération!cet opus acoustique s'avère indispensable.Les chansons finement ciselées et souvent poignantes (Mercenary Song, Goodbye)Steve Earle s'est entouré pour l'occasion des remarquables Peter Rowan (guitare et mandoline) et Norman Blake (dobro) L'instrumental ""Nothern Winds"" enchainé à ce petit chef d'oeuvre qu'est ""Ben Mc Culloch"" vaut à lui seul l'acquisition du cd! Par la suite S Earle va nous donner quelques bonnes galettes comme ""I feel alright"" nettement plus électrique et surtout le très bluegrass ""the Mountain"" avec le Del Mc Coury Band, cd que je recommande chaudement!"
5,"pour moi le meilleur de Johnny avec le précédent ""Rivière ouvre ton lit"". tout y est, la voix, les musiciens, les textes, la sincérité, une grande partie de ce que le Johnny d'aujourd'hui a perdu. Flagrant délit n'a pas vieilli et dans l'oeuvre de Johnny ce disque reste et restera un must. Bravo à MicKy Jones et tommy Brown, ces deux compères ont beaucoup apporté à Johnny. (Palais des sports 1969 par exemple)"
5,"Découvert par hasard sur un site d'écoute de musique en ligne, Augustana est mon coup de coeur du moment. Musicalement travaillé, avec des mélodies magnifiques, je le place au même niveau que l'excellentissime album de The script. A quand une tournée française?"
1,"J'attendais avec impatience le troisième album de Ashlee mais quelle déception ! Produite par Timbaland, Ashlee a complétement changé de style je trouve que cet album ne ressemble à rien et a perdu le son pop / rock des 2 précédents albums qui eux étaient géniaux !! Pour ma part, mon préféré reste I Am Me qui est purement génial , bien que Autobiography soit excellent lui aussi. Franchement, il n'y a aucune chanson sur ce troisième opus à laquelle j'ai réellement accrochée à part peut être Little Miss Obsessive ou Never dream alone , seule balade de l'album. J'espère que Ashlee se reprendra par la suite et le pire c'est qu'avec cet album purement commercial, je crois qu'elle a beaucoup moins vendu qu'avant ..."
1,"Quincy Jones n'échappe pas à la bossa nova qui submerge les États-Unis en ce début des années 1960. Il s'y essaye en 1963 à la tête de son big band en se réappropriant les standards de la musique brésilienne. Réussite incontestable pour ses admirateurs ou naufrage mémorable pour ses détracteurs et amoureux de la musique brésilienne? Il convient simplement de rappeler que la bossa nova convient aux petits ensembles et non aux big bands qui proposent des agrandissements hors-cadre et des choix esthétiques éloignés de l'esprit de la bossa. J'ai eu des difficultés à reconnaître ""Desafinado"" ou ""Chega De Saudade"" avec leur rythme empreint de swing. Seul ""Manha de Carnaval"" avec ses tempi alanguis, moins ""sportifs"", est ""supportable"".  Dans un domaine où le réussites sont rarissimes, choisissez plutôt ""Big Band Bossa Nova"" où Stan Getz et Jim Hall, sous la direction de Gary McFarland, ne dénaturent pas cette musique. La course vers la bossa nova ne saurait justifier tous les excès."
1,"Ici pas de dub, mais de superbes morceaux de reggae roots, soutenus par un groupe impeccable (la basse de Boris Gardiner !..)composés et chantés par le maître en personne. La production typique du studio Black Ark est évidemment présente (bruits samplés, flying cymbals et travail de réverb...). Seul point noir ici le repiquage sur CD est honteux, le son est dégueulasse et certains titres ne tournent pas à la bonne vitesse... Donc précipitez vous sur la version rééditée par Trojan, qui propose en bonus Super Ape et Return Of The Super Ape, parus à la même époque."

2,"Possédant tous les albums du bonhomme, y compris les plus difficiles à dégoter (Fade Away Diamond Time (génial !), Field Recordings...), dans notre beau pays de la vieille Europe, cette France qui s'obstine à bouder l'« americana », j'attendais beaucoup de ce nouvel opus du Sieur Casal.  Sa collaboration récente avec un autre grand du genre, Ryan Adams, et la qualité des 2 albums ainsi produits (Easy Tiger en 2007 et Cardinology en 2009), m'avaient donné bon espoir de pouvoir retrouver sur ce nouvel album, le Neal Casal « roots » rencontré un soir d'hivers à Montpellier à l'occasion d'un très beau concert solo donné devant une cinquantaine de privilégiés dans le cadre de la promo de sa compil' Maybe California - An Introduction To. Mais force est de constater qu'à l'instar du très décevant précédent album, No Wish To Riminisce que je ne suis jamais parvenu à écouter en entier, Roots &amp; Wings est loin de combler les attentes du fan de la première heure que je suis. Cet album porte déjà très mal son titre tant il est difficile de trouver un quelconque côté roots aux 16 titres qui le composent, sauf si être roots se résume à gratter quelques accords de guitare acoustique sur un fond de pedal steel... Bien que raté, le précédent avait au moins la qualité d'afficher clairement une volonté assumée de sonner « pop ». Celui-ci, insipide, se cherche tout le long sans jamais réellement se trouver. Aucun titre ne se dégage vraiment du lot et l'ennui n'est jamais bien loin. Seules quelques trop rares bonnes mélodies (Signals Fading, Signals Fadind et... Signals Fading !) parviennent ponctuellement à sortir l'auditeur de sa torpeur. Casal devrait sérieusement penser à retourner aux fondamentaux, à ce qu'il sait faire de mieux, soit de bonnes chansons taillées pour la route et les grands espaces. Problème : en est-il encore capable ? Ces dernières livraisons ne trahissent-elles pas un cruel manque d'inspiration ?"
