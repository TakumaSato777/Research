5,"The Music of Aaron Copleand is timeless and purely Amerian.  Thus, it is the best choice to be in a movie about basketball, one of America's favorite sports.  This collection of Aaron Copland's music introduced me to  this great composer and is a perfect start for new classical listeners.   SUperb"
1,"Considering the fact that the University of California - Berkeley boasts the largest repetoire {sp?} of school songs of ANY university in the country makes the fact that this compilation has not included ANY of them problematic at the very least.  Big C (or Sons of Westwood to you theiving baby bears out there) - Fight for California - Sons of California - Stanford Jonah - Golden Bear - Make Way for the Bear - Roll On - Cal Band March - California Triumph - Palms of Victory - California Indian Song - California Marching Song - One More River - All Hail - Hail to California - California, We're For You --  Take your pick - they are all fantastic - and I think I forgot a few...  To leave out Cal is either shoddy work or bad temperment.  Go Bears - Beat the Cougars"
1,"If you are looking for the fiery songs we all hear on Saturdays throughout the fall, keep looking. The song selection also dates this album. Many of today's power houses are excluded in favor of those who saw their days of glory before my lifetime. It is also insulting to see the Iowa Fight Song credited to Iowa State"
5,"Supergrass is one of the best bands active today.  Their sound is both retro and current.  Not only can they make catchy music, but their musicianship is second to none.  That said, this release took a few listens to grow on me, but it has certainly done that.  Each time it takes its place in my car's CD player, it stays there for weeks at a time.  I feel this is one of their better releases, and I anxiously await the next.."
5,"Tempest expertly infuses ballads and reels with rock, giving traditional folk music a new energy as well as contributing some original pieces that are equally timeless. I like this album even better than their last (titled &quot;Balance&quot;). Though each track is distinct and stands well on its own, they all complement one another and play almost seamlessly as a whole. Maybe I'm partial since I first heard Tempest live as the current ensemble of musicians, but I think newcomer violinist Sue Draheim's harmony vocals add a sweet texture the previous album did not have. Then again, there's just something about the female voice in general that gives authenticity to the emotional layer in folk ballads. At any rate, having seen some of Tempest's live performances, I can attest that all of its current members are highly talented and treat the craft of blending folk and rock with a professionalism that is entirely trustworthy. Listening to this album is like gathering around a home fire and being entertained by a captivating storyteller. Definitely worth hearing...again and again"
1,"has anyone else noticed that there isnt a single nirvana song? of all of the bands of the 90s, nirvana was undoubtedly one of the more luminary bands. and yet they appear nowhere on this compilation. instead, we are treated to the worst of the consumerist, disposable pop trash the 90s had to offer. a retrospective album should do more to cover the diverse styles of music that were prevalent at this time, but this album falls short in every aspect."
1,"I loved the 90's. Some great things happened to me in the 90's and I have tons of great memories, none of which are associated with anything about this compilation. To be fair, I'm OK with 3, maybe 4 of the songs. Tubthumping and Shine I can deal with. The former was kind of good but severely overplayed for and by the worst kind of people. The latter is not a good song but somehow it has grown on me, plus I think it's funny that the guitar part is stolen directly from the Kinks' &quot;Lola&quot;. I've always thought I'm Too Sexy was funny, bad but funny. And the En Vogue song is actually kind of good, but don't tell anyone I said that. The rest of the album? Crap of the crappiest crap caliber. The Macarena? Mambo no. 5? Whoomp there it is? Those songs should never have even seen the light of day. And O.P.P. was possibly the worst thing about the 90's. Plus does anybody really need to OWN the theme from friends? Why why WHY????!!!!! The only attrocity this CD is missing is that awful Choo Choo Train song. Please make this one go away quickly"
5,"I see Wynton Marsalis mesmerized, James Brown befuddled, Aretha astounded, Mariah mortified, Beyonce blushing, Eric Clapton clapping, and Pelham Goodard (Peegee) gasping. Ahhh yes! The seven-layer salad of song (jazz-funk-soul-pop-r&b-rock-calypso)...The Magic Johnson of music. My fav...TTD's Recurring Dream. I luv the metaphysical stories, Jimi Hendrix-like wa-wa guitar sound, and that cowbell sounding percussion. Mad props to We don't have...great calypso, Holding on to you, Supermodel Sandwich w/cheese...so, so funky, as well as all the others. It's too bad many slept on this work of art. But many slept on Ray Charles until just recently. Although the album title doesn't indicate what the song or album is about, nevertheless, it is less than flattering. No other complaints though. Definitely an album for the thinking person and introspective. I genuflect out of courtesy and respect."
5,"Don't let a few bad reviews fool you! This is easily one of the best albums out there! There's not a bad song in the bunch! And Courtney Jaye is easily one of best and most original singer/songwriters around also! And she's worked with some of the best in the business to create this musical masterpiece! This is nothing like the average pop music you hear, It has more of a hawaiian sound on some songs, I noticed that the first time i heard it! She calls it rootsy/exotic/alt/pop on her myspace page! That's one of the things i like most about the album! Plus the songs are all so fun, catchy, and dreamy, and she has such a great singing voice, i just can't get enough of it! And there's something for everyone to like! I really love all of the songs so much! But if i had to pick any favorites probably"" Time For Goodbye"" ""This Is The Day"" ""Love me"" and ""Hanalei Road"" to name a few! So please buy this album and listen to the whole thing, with an open mind, and listen more than once! If you're anything like me and really like great music that's different than the usual dull boring music you're used to hearing, I know you'll love it as much as i do! Courtney Jaye is one very talented artist that has real staying power! She's already finished her next album so that's proof of that! And from what i've heard of it, it's great also! I know she certainly has a life long fan in me!    "
1,"I bought this album because I am always interested in finding great new artists and music.  I love Sarah McLachlan, Emm Gryner, Indigo Girls, Jem-- things along that line.  So I thought I would love Courtney Jaye.  But I just can't.  I think it's terribly simplistic, predictable and unimaginable.  I like her voice, but combined with the simple lyrics, unoriginal themes and repetitive tunes, I just have to turn her off after a couple songs.  I tried to be open-minded (I even like some Kelly Clarkson and Natalie Imbruglia songs) but I don't hear the talent"
2,"That title probably gives the wrong impression. But there are a few different types of musicals. The ones that you have to see to understand, the ones you can just listen to and get the jist of it, and then those that some one has to explain it to you after you've seen and listened to it. This show is one that you have to see. I haven't seen the show, so this revue is based soley on my impression after listening to it, and I wasnt really entertained. A good bit of the music is tap dancing, and that just inst as thrilling as it would be if you were seeing it. So, know that a good bit of what you will be listening is tap dancing. The actual singing has some good moments. Its also has some extremly grating moments, which may have been for effect in the show, but not pleasent to listen to. I would definitly listen to samples of as many songs as you can before you decide to buy this one. Collectors should get it just because they collect, but others should probably not by this one blindly. If your getting a gift for someone who likes ""musicals"" this wouldnt be one to get. Fav song: ""Lynching Blues"""
2,"Apparently,their last work with frontman Steve Perry and quite the let down.'Trial...' was the band's '96 comeback attempt,but if I remember correctly this CD was a stiff from the get-go.I tried SO hard to get into this fifteen track disc,but even with a duration of 68 minutes,I just couldn't.The songs don't completely suck,they just don't appear to have much life.Fantastic cover,don't you agree?If you're an old school Journey fan,I encourage you to check out their new 2005 release,'Generations' with vocalist Steve Augeri,who's been with the band for awhile now.That CD is surprisingly good,as I'd give it 3 1/2,maybe 4 stars.Keep in mind that guitarist Neal Schon is their 'key' player"
2,"As the fantastic song title above indicates, life IS hard, and it's been hard on Johnny Winter. It is definitely beginning to show. I play guitar and sing, too, and an arrhythmic heart keeps me off stage a lot. What a drag. Well, I hear Johnny has a few health issues, and I only mentioned my own in order to be able to say that he sounds on this album a little like I feel, sometimes. His voice has weakened quite a bit, and thinned out, but as with the change in Bob Dylan's voice, he actually sounds more musical, sweeter, now, than before. So the burning glory is gone, and the blistering solos are replaced with very carefully phrased and finished riffs. And, yes, a little lacking in energy at some points. The Monkey Song is almost too skanky to be believed. Hell, Johnny, they're all shaved on the internet these days anyway, and that's probably as far as some lame old guy like you gets, right? Sorry. This guy, doing Rock& Roll hootchie-Koo with Rick Derringer back in 1970, could blow walls down. I guess this is the blues"
2,"I'll state the obvious. Rich Boy's southern twang is so thick that its hard to understand what he is saying sometimes. This album has more bad tracks than good tracks so let me focus on the good then the bad. Standout Tracks: Throw Some Ds is a catchy first single that I didnt like at first and the remix with Andre 3000(he had the best verse on here), Nelly, Murphy Lee, The Game is a lot better than the original. Boy Looka Here is an alright second single plus I like how the beat breaks down. And I Love You had potential to be a great track till Pastor Troy delivers a crappy verse on it but Big Boi held it down on here. Lost Girls and Ghetto Rich(featuring John Legend) are two tracks that are worth hearing plus any song of substance I'll give credit for. Filler: Rich Boy pulls a Rick Ross and has way too many chick songs on here like What It Do, Good Things, Touch That A**(the worst out of all of them) and On The Regular. Role Models is weak and so is the fillerific Hustla Balla Gangsta Mack and Gangsta. Get To Poppin has to be the worst plus I've heard Pitbull spit over that same horrible beat(and that track sucked too). Bottom Line: 6 good songs are a good enough reason to skip this album. Yeah it might have some catchy cuts but the album is packed to the rim with skip material."
1,"By far one of the worse albums 2 come out the south since,  well since I can remember, GARBAGE,  on the highest level, I actually took the CD back to Best Buy, walked up to customer service and told them they can have it back and keep the money. If u are trying to be Rich, U need to come up with a better game plan cause u sure didnt put effort in this peice of work. U want to be a Rich Boy, I want to be a Rich MAN, Now how Rich is that"
2,"What happened ?  Ice Cube is my favorite rapper of all time!  For anyone else this would have been 3 stars, but this is a real disappointment to me persoanlly.  If you like the older HARD hitting Ice Cube and NWA I would try one of his earlier releases.  Who knows though... I love plenty of CDs that I hated at first"
1,"I'm a huge fan of the Beatles. I'm also a huge fan of the modern artists that did this album. ..and the Backbeat movie was ok too. So I figure, how can I go wrong. I'll buy the record.   Well simply put, the album sounds like a bunch of generic poo.   Why in the world did they have Thurston Moore on here?  Hmm, we need somebody to stand there and strum basic chords .. let's bring in someone who normally plays sound-effects guitar with magnets and drumsticks.     Obviously the point was to put together a modern supergroup (underground supergroup anyway) to cover a supergroup.  Problem = it doesn't sound like The Beatles OR like these familiar modern artists. It just falls somewhere boringly inbetween, though that might be exactly what some people would want.  DAVE GROHL CANNOT SING. Yeah that's right I said it. Gumby was a better rockstar then this guy. ..well i mean that sarcastically but thinking about it, Gumby was actually a really cool rockstar. But back on topic, Dave Grohl needs to stick to things he's good at like chewing gum, beating the snot out of drum-sets, and growing big sweaty moustaches.   I've heard cardboard boxes blowing in the wind that sounded more exciting then this record.   If Amazon.com had the feature, I'd give it a negative star just for having the guy from Soul Asylum on it.  "
4,"Almost a carbon copy of it's predecessor, 'Vital Signs'. Unlike 'Vital Signs', which was virtually flawless, this one has some flaws.  This follow-up has less memorable songs, cheesier lyrics, and drags a little bit more.  Still, a good overall effort nonetheless.  The highlight is obviously 'Is This Love', which reached as high as #9 on the bilboard charts.  Overall, same mid-80's power-ballad formula as 'Vital Signs', which is never a bad thing, is it"
5,"So you wanna have music on that provides some real audio comfort, music that has some very cool rhythms, music that is well-orchestrated and textured, well search no more for Plush delivers on all levels, it is a lovely mix of music in the so-called ""downtempo"" vein but it is really above and beyond just the latest kind of thing, instead it is a combination of some very sexy music that exemplifies the best in current trends in music! I found it to be wonderful for playtime and my lover agreed with some stunning sonic cues to me as the disc unwound the first time we had it on as we got it on! It is certainly a great disc for the romantically inclined although it is good enough to be just darn good without having to occupy anything specific by way of description since it rolls easily all the way from the very cool to the beautifully hot. I could wax on about my fave tracks but I actually love them all, it is a well put together set and has that magical sort of flow from track to track. You should try it on for love, don't even say a word to your sweetie, just put forward your best kiss and let the disc play, Plush indeed"
1,"I consider Golijov the Britanny Spears of new music. He re-hashes what others have done,albeit with less originality than Britanny, all the while making me nod off"
1,"It has moments of funny, but overall only good for one or two plays.  Like Howard Sterns said, good idea but I don't know if I could sit and listen to it"
5,"Prefab Sprout, a band that just ages very well.  Thomas Dolby's footprints are all over this recording.  While this CD lacks ""Wild Horses"", it contains just about every song any fan could wish for.  Hands down, it beats the Life of Surprises compilation with its inclusions of ""Lions in My Own Garden""  and other material from Swoon, as well as such gems such as ""The Golden Calf"" (a personal favorite of mine) off From Langley Park to Memphis as well as the wonderful ""Bonny"" from Steve McQueen/Two Wheels Good.  I think I could listen to this CD for weeks on end and never tire of such greats as ""Life of Suprises"", ""The Sound Of Crying"", ""Carnival 2000"", ""Appetite"" and so many others.  Yes, you could go buy all the Sprout's stuff (which I recommend highly).  Still, this is a great way to savor one of the most wonderful bands out there."
5,"You'll probably recognize GRAZING IN THE GRASS as the backround music from that TV commercial with the Chinese-American lady from the View.   I forget whether its for khakis or golf, and I most certainly don't watch the View,  but this is great music.   - - You might remember Issac Hayes making fun of  the million mile an hour &quot;I can dig it&quot; conjugations in &quot;I'm  Gonna Get You Sucka&quot;  - -My point is, they're songs like KUNG FU  FIGHTING and a lot of tunes in those GAP commercials... you may not have  actually bought the album or even know the words (personally, I have a  sealed copy of Kung Fu), but if you're a certain age, you you're bound to  remember them or perk up when you hear them.  I tend to think of this group  as kind of a slightly more soulful take off on the Fifth Dimension.  When  I'm in the mood I like both groups.   They are cheery yet soulful at the  same time.   While Grazing was their big hit, I'd have to say the winner  for me is LOVE OR LET ME BE LONELY...  especially the way it starts out all  slow and dramatic then goes into that brassy uptempo part.   - - Anyway,  these songs make great listening (and sometimes backround music) for the  key of life.   For sure they were definitely the &quot;Have a Nice  Day/*smile*&quot; side of the '70s.   I would definitely reccomend  exploring them"
5,"I absolutely love this CD. I bought it when it first came out, and I used to listen to it everyday, a few times a day. But recently I found my CD and it was CRACKED! Anyhow , I'm about to buy it again. But I wanted to let everybody know that this CD is definetly hot, you don't have to skip any songs because they all are good"
2,"But they tried WAY TO HARD to supercede Front Page News and to make it MORE SUCCESSFUL. Failed at both attempts!  This was a big slump period for the band at this point in time.  In fact most of these songs when performed live, HAD the intense fire, these studio versions lacked. 'Way of the World' scorched everytime I heard it live, but on No Smoke Without Fire, well it was a smouldering flicker.  This was one of their biggest letdowns with Laurie Wisefield on second guitar.  The live tracks included here (Lorelei) are nice but are hardly indicative of what 'couldve been', if that energy was put to better use for this project"
1,"My fellow reviewers have one of two things happening:  (1) they received different discs than I, or (2) they have been smoking some very serious stuff.   The average review is five stars?   I can give it only one which is a major disappointment!   Why?   Although the title of the CD is accurate, the quality of the disk is perfectly terrible.   A number of tracks reproduce horribly and No. 2 (There I Go) is particularly bad.   One wonders why the folks that make thse recordings can't take the time to make certain that the customer gets a decent recording for his or her money.  If original master recordings need to be cleaned up in order to give the listener a fair shake then this needs to be done.   This is a perfectly wonderful assortment of Vaughn Monroe's recordings.  It is a perfectly terrible recording of them"
5,"Anyone who dismisses blues music as being sad and depressing and whiny should listen to this album. Sure, B.B. King sings about heartbreak and lost love in many of the songs, but he does so in such a way that it is uplifting, maybe just because you can relate to it and say ""oh, that cat knows what I'm feeling"". That, right there, is why this record is timeless. All of the songs, with the possible exception of ""Help the Poor"", are knockouts. This being a live album of course, the audience is absolutely IN LOVE with B.B. and the band, and people often shout out things like ""Play it all night!"" and ""Tell it, B.B.!"" If this were a studio album, it would not be nearly as good. The advantage of hearing blues live is that you get to hear a whole different atmosphere- people screaming, clapping, going wild for the sweet sound of Lucille. Which reminds me, not only is the guitar on this album fantastic, but also B.B.'s vocals are downright amazing! They range from a deep gravely tone to a sweet falsetto, and are some of the best blues vocals ever put to tape. If you do not own this, get it, just to hear classics like ""Sweet Little Angel"", ""Worry Worry"", ""How Blue Can You Get"", and ""You Upset Me Baby"". An absolute must-have"
5,"It's awesome that someone could give you the feeling you get when you hear a song for the first time all over again with the same songs. This album is just great.You get used to &quot;Frio&quot; , then you get the same songs you love in english and it works wonderfully.I could not believe my ears the first time. This is an excellent piece of art and it should be in your collection"
5,"This 1972 soundtrack for the Barbet Schroeder film ""La Vallee"" was recorded during two, one-week sessions, between which a tour of Japan was sandwiched.  Interestingly, the album works as a cohesive whole, in spite of the short recording time, and the ""dry"" production (especially on Nick Mason's drums) lends the album a very tight feel.  It has been written that Obscured by Clouds is the last true group effort and I pretty much agree.  The album also finds the band poised on the cusp of massive, global superstardom, which would become fully realized with the mega-smash, mega-million selling album The Dark Side of the Moon (1973).  Lyrically, Roger Waters begins to reflect on issues that he would develop further, including his war-victim father (Free Four) and Dave Gilmour refers to science fiction with Childhoods End, which is the title of Arthur C. Clarke's classic from the genre.  I guess it is worth noting that Childhood's End was recorded without the final verse and that Roger would write all lyrics for the group following this album, thus ""relieving"" Dave of this responsibility.  Dave's vocals are also excellent and he really comes across as a confident singer.  His guitar playing is also in top flight too.  In addition to tracks with lyrics, there are quite a few instrumentals as well.  Musically, I think Pink Floyd was in fine form on this album.  My favorite cuts include the atmospheric, VCS3 synthesizer heavy instrumental tracks Obscured by Clouds, Mudmen, and Absolutely Curtains (loads of Rick Wright's sustained Hammond organ), along with the heavy instrumental When You're In.  Burning Bridges, Wot's...uh the Deal, and Stay are also superb and feature the trademark drifting and spacey Floyd sound.  At the opposite end of the spectrum is the thunderous The Gold It's in the..., which reminds me somewhat of the bone-crushing Nile Song (from More, 1969).  Free Four is the only bouncy and lighthearted track on the album, which stands in stark contrast with Water's dark subject matter - the ruminations of someone on their deathbed.  With respect to this 1994 remaster it is just OK and features good sound quality, images from the film, and all lyrics.  All in all, this excellent album is a personal favorite and is very highly recommended along with Atom Heart Mother (1970), Meddle (1971), Wish You Were Here (1975), and Animals (1977)."
4,"Most of Yanni's releases before this CD were compilations of earlier works.  This was his first all new work in quite a while.  And I still consider it his best work to date.  This CD contains most of the pieces used in his &quot;Live at the Acropolis&quot;.  The &quot;Live&quot; CD and Video have a better performance of these pieces however, because of the added instrumentation.  But in the realm of his non-live recordings, this is his best"
4,"""Ocean's Eleven"" is one of those few movie soundtracks worth having. The disc features an eclectic blend of music with the unifying theme of hipness. The CD is as cool as the movie. The hit is of course 'A Little Less Conversation' which became the theme song to the NBC show ""Las Vegas."" The exposure eventually dethroned 'Viva Las Vegas' as the city's choice Elvis tune. Very few soundtracks have made such an impact. Under the general umbrella of jazz, the disc features lounge, acid jazz, big band and even orchestral music. It has a choice blend of swaggering vintage sounds and sophisticated modern music. At the same time, the album finds balance between time tested classics and original music created for the Ocean's Eleven project. The disc will have high appeal to instrumental enthusiasts. While the soundtrack would be stronger without some of the film's dialogue, such a product wouldn't be difficult to create in the day and age of CD-R burners. ""Ocean's Eleven"" is a hip journey worth taking."
1,i regret buying this cd even though it just a buck i didn't like it at all the girl or whatever she is don't know how to sing at all sounds like she is whinning don't buy it i know what i am saying i am a trip hop fan and check out soma sonic /future thats real musi
1,"This cd is horrible. It starts of with a couple catchy pops songs that Carson Daily liked then all the sudden, they bust out some rap. Canadians can't rap, I DEMAND JUSTICE!!!"
5,"Funk, in its purest form, is hard to come by these days. That's because we don't have the kind of wreckless visionaries that the 70s had, like Dr. John and George Clinton. These guys were so far gone into their music that they bordered on being parodies of themselves, and somehow that translated into the kind of raw and unprecedented energy that makes their music so saturated in what one would ideally define as 'funky'. Take Dr. John: the dude is basically the white George Clinton, with his crazy head dresses and honky tonk muppet voice. Put him in front of a piano, get the Meters to lay down the tightest funk grooves you've ever heard, and add producer Alain Toussaint's canjun roots and you've got an exceptionally enjoyable album in ""In The Right Place"". The music is uplifting and listenable; The Meters take the house down with some thick bass riffs, brilliantly arranged horns and tight-as-hell percussions. Dr. John wails like a drunken canjun cartoon character, which is such an endearing and appropriate compliment to this musical experience that you will not know how to listen to this kind of funk without a voice as original and funky as this.  While the entire album provides a consistent line-up of quality jams, the two stand-outs that have become two of Dr. John's greatest hits are ""Right Place, Wrong Time"" and ""Such A Night"". ""Right Place, Wrong Time"" would fill any dance floor with its danceability factor, while ""Such A Night"" is a kind of honky tonk interpretation of a faster-paced soul ballad, with great backing vocals and a nostalgic, Bugsy Malone-sounding keys section.  This album is a must-have for any self-respecting fan of the funk. Dr. John is a true pioneer in the genre and, while most of his work is worth owning, this is nonetheless one of his best albums to prove it"
1,"EWF is perhaps the greatest band of our time.  They had the best songs for a 20 year span and yet the record companies continue to put together greatest hit packages on one cd.  How the heck can you have an EWF greatest  hits on one cd?  Impossible.  Hey record company, while you're at it, do  the Beatles, Elvis, Stevie and Frank too"
1,not good at all!!!! while watching the movie i thought it sounded like a great soundtrack... but i think they must have put all the bad songs on i
1,"This band is the funniest thing I have ever seen. Go to their website, www.mightyrhapsody.com here you will find why they are so damn funny. These guys actually believe they are dragon slayers! I can't stop laughing at this band! Say hello to Medieval Metal"
1,"With great anticipation, I purchased this CD but it came in some obscure ""Super Audio CD"" format by Sony. It is unplayable on my CD player and unreadable on my laptop. The Amazon product description does not designate this. Bummer. Now I have to go through some return/replace hassle"
5,"I first saw this album in the store and I had never heard of this band before and I thought they looked awesome on the front cover so I took a chance and bought the CD. When I got it home and listened to it for the first time I immediately fell in love with the songs Solitaire Unraveling, These Filthy Hands, Never Let It Go, The Wrist, The New Cult King, and Too Much Nothing. I love how they make 8 band members work so uniquely and the two vocalists just put a whole other aspect to their music and separates them from many other bands. I saw the Solitaire Unraveling video on Headbangers Ball and I think it is so awesome and shows just how much emotion there is in their music. I would recommend this album to anybody who wants to listen to and a unique and talented band"
1,"As others have noted, this turns out to be only a handful of lullabyes in Spanish sung by Maria Del Rey, plus nursery rhymes spoken by children and men (not very good for putting a baby to sleep), plus the whole thing repeated in English.  In addition, I had been looking for traditional Latin American pieces and apparently all of these are contemporary.  Don't waste your money...I'm planning on giving my copy away if I can figure out someone I know who could actually use it"
5,"Although I usually preffer more energetic D&B this album really caught me by surprise. The beats are so precise and well executed. I really enjoyed the amount of control that Photek had over the music. Don't go in thinking this will be dieselboy or DJ DB because it's not. It's an entirely different beast. It's a bit more along the lines of Polygon Window mixed with Amon Tobin's walls of sound. It's a really great album to relax and read to. Some of the tracks can be a bit stale but most of them are pretty great, especially track one (it's my fav)"
1,to try and re create NWA with the west coast best is a good idea but it cant be done. The sound of NWA was so raw loud and straight ghetto that this remake serves as a sorry re mak
2,If you have listened to the original cd you will find this one to be  terrible. It can never be as good as the original.  Also Snoop Dogg screwes  up in Gangsta Gangst
2,"I was stunned by how bad this CD sounds.  I'm no expert, so I can't give you a precise description with proper terminology.  Suffice it to say it's a bad job of transferring the recordings to CD.  I later bought the Gold version, and the difference is like night and day.  Judy Collin's voice is too wonderful to let this awful CD prevent you from really hearing her.  The Gold version is worth the extra money"
5,"Any moderate fan of The Scarlett Pimpernel, musical, book or movie(s) should own this cd. I absolutely love the songs ""Believe"" and ""Vivez"" which are not on the Encore cd, and this disk is worth owning for them alone. I'm not crazy about Chauvlin's voice on this disk, which is a bit pinched and his phrasing is awkward at times. For great Chauvlin tracks (like Where's the Girl) you definatly need to buy the Encore cd. Christine Andreas's renditions of ""Only Love"" and ""You Are My Home"" are also more dramatic and truely broadway versions on this disk whereas on the Encore disk these are pop-versions sung by people who were not in the show."
5,"Not only is Pink an amazing singer, but her lyrics are soo deep and personal.  I love people who write about the sad times because a lot of people needs to hear something they can relate to.   Family Potrait speaks to a lot of people, including my brother, who overhead the song and keeps requesting me to replay track 7.   The whole album is a work of art so it's hard to choose, but if I had to choose, my favorites are Don't let me get me, Just Like a Pill, Family Potrait and Lonely Girl.  Pink's voice is soo raw and real that you can actually feel the pain in her voice.  Once you listen to this album, you will want hear more.   So I will go ahead and let you know that her third album is Try This and her fourth, which is her best thus far is ""I'm Not Dead"".  So please give this album a chance.  Pink is a real artist and she will be around for a long time because she is true to herself.    "
5,I first heard this album on a trip to Ireland.  The women artists on this album epitomize the soul of a beautiful land--the cd quality is awesome--I recommend to all who want to expand their tastes
5,"I agree with the previous reviewer, cool jazz?  John Lewis and Milt Jackson  defined cool jazz.  Much better than that crap now that I call ""Smoove Jazz"".  This CD evokes memories of the Music Inn and Tanglewood in the 50s.  The namesake of this CD is the song Django, a tribute to the late great Django Reinhardt.  This is a must for any jazz enthusiasts collection"
5,"Doc Watson is great, and so is Clarence Ashley. This is music worth listening to. Often"
4,"The Further Adventures of Lord Quas is the Trout Mask Replica of rap.  Madlib, much like Captain Beefheart, has a unique style that is hard to penetrate and hard to pin down.  The songs on this album aren't really songs per se, they are more like random clips and odd ball samples with the occasional spattering of rhyme thrown in.  The album is dizzying to listen to.  Their must be 50 or 60 little mini skits, song fragments, and other oddities sprinkled through the album.  All this combines to make one of the best and innovative rap albums to come down the pipe this year.  Madlib/Quasimoto has created an innovative and unique production style that he created with the first Quasimoto album the Unseen, continued with the excellent Madvillian record, and continues to refine with this production.  Overall I think that his production sounds more complete on this record than on Madvillian.  What makes this a weaker release than Madvillian is the quality of lyrics and the MC involved.  Quasimoto is not as good as MF Doom.  Quasimoto seems to be riffing on Doom's style throughout, and his voice can get kind of irritating.  He sounds like Eminem on helium and without all the homophobic gay bashing.  It's an interesting trick, kind of like what Prince did on If I Was Your Girlfriend, but extended for a whole album.  His style can be grating though.    Overall, The Further Adventures of Lord Quas is a good album that fans of off-kilter alternative rap will love.  If you like Dr. Octagon, MF Doom, Peanut Butter Wolf, or Aesop Rock, then you'll enjoy this.  You want to be patient with it though, Madlib's style is like peeling an onion, you need to remove some of the outer layers before you can get the full effect of it. "
1,"Precious is an interesting document of a band in flux, searching for a sound. Gnecco's voice is in fine form, but on only his second record, he is repeating himself. The wonderful falsetto is heard hitting the same notes over and over again, which begs the question, is there true vocal range here, or a couple of parlor trick notes? We will not be sure until we hear more form OURS. When not in falsetto, Gnecco is developing a kind of warble that will alienate many listeners who prefer a cleaner vocal delivery. In addition, the chemistry between the band seems off, making the album sound incohesive or even over-dubbed, The guitar lines which Milone and Gnecco intend to create tension which boils over to melodic changes, seem dissonant and unneccessary. This music would be better served by simpler production. Ethan Johns could probably stand to play a bit more drums - it almost seems like he is deliberately restraining himself in the context of music that isn't sure weather it's hard rock or singer-songwriter stuff. &quot;Leaves&quot; is the lone high spot for this album, with its catchy Beatles meets U2 progression. The rest of the album, as typified by &quot;Kill the Band&quot; lacks cohesion, hooks, and musical identity. Instead of just letting the songs flow and write themselves, it seems like Gnecco is forcing things and deliberately trying to be complex with concepts that are essentially simple. Lyrically, Gneeco could use some help, as he is repeating rhymes, and syllabic patterns all over the place. From a standpoint of lyical meaning, the album is pretty much the standard emo / alt rock / depressed vibe. Nothing new here. Maybe just a sophomore jinx. stay tuned"
2,"i am an honestly big fan of beyonce. i have both of her cds and have always loved destiny's child. i even love her new song ""beautiful liar"". but i think that it is illogical for her to re-release this album, escpecially since releasing it in april defeats the purpose of naming the album ""Bday"" because her birthday is in september. but still, i can't help but love her new song. and i think that she did a great job with shakira. it is an unlikely collabo between two of the most successful artists of the decade, which makes it a great song. but shakira totally steals the spotlight with her stronger voice. i think this track should belong to shakira and she could use it as one of her tracks for her next album"
5,"Throughout the reviews for ""Bone Machine"", you'll see warnings that this music is harrowing, obsessed with death, ""not the place to begin with Tom Waits.""  Pshaw.  This album makes me grin ear-to-ear, all the way through.  This one contains some of Tom's most lovely ballads: ""Who Are You"", and the amazing ""A Little Rain"".  It has some of his funniest lyrics: ""Murder in the Red Barn"" comes to mind.     ""Cause there's nothin' strange About an axe with bloodstains in the barn  There's always some killin' You got to do around the farm""  The poetry on ""Bone Machine"" is truly (to use an overused phrase), mind-blowing.  Hell, I might even go to church if they sang honest songs about mortality like the chillingly beautiful ""Dirt in the Ground""!  ""The Ocean Doesn't Want Me"" is his best spoken word piece ever.  ""Jesus Gonna Be Here"" just flat rocks out.     Be clear about this: ""Bone Machine"" is not background music: it demands attention.  But the bottom line: be not afraid.  Strap on the headphones, pour a tall glass, and take the ride. "
2,"I know that it takes talent to make music, and I hate to criticize any musicians because I certainly couldn't do it, but this CD was just not that good. There are some cool beats, but they're pretty forgettable. Lyrics in electronic music aren't always deep or anything, but in some cases, I think she actually was trying to make a &quot;real song&quot;, so it was kind of sad. Her vocals are Madonna-esque, without the smooth production. Maybe she just didn't quite live up to the hype. I'm beginning to think that most female djs &quot;make it&quot; just because of the novelty of female djs. There was nothing to HATE, but there certainly wasn't anything to love, either"
2,"Yeah, i bought this CD because i heard she is one of the better Drum N' Bass DJs....and she's really damn cute.  Problem is...this CD isn't very good at all.  Trying to go too main stream popish, some of the lyrics are laughable, there isn't a single song on this CD that would make it into one of my sets.  I'm sure she's a very good DJ, but someone led her down the wrong road this time"
4,"Yeah its true folks the Amazon reviewer was absolutely correct in that the lyrics are simply something to hang the pretty melodies on and the music is nowhere near as sophisticated as Blur would later write, but... and its a big but. Blur never again made an album this unabashedly joyful and ecstatic again. Mix great melodies, dumb dumb simple but very singable lyrics, lovely vocal harmonies strapped on top of a driving guitar with compelling and dancable rhythms and you have this rolling explosion of brit-pop bliss. Sometimes an album doesn't have to mean anything to be good"
2,"I first heard Nadia Ali on a few tracks from Global Underground 29 - Sharam/Dubai (which I seriously recommend) which immediately made her my new favorite singer - so I bought this with great expectations, only to be really dissapointed. I can't imagine why she's working with this guy - sorry, he's a hack - these tracks sound like leftovers from Kylie Minogue's trash, and yes, I could do better. Avoid this at all costs & hope Nadia finds somebody with talent to work with ... yawn"
5,"I was only casually aquainted with Mary Chapin Carpenter's music before picking up this album.  The hits I knew were all here, and so was a lot more material I have come to love as well.  I was a bit leery that &quot;Down at the Twist and Shout&quot; was a live version from the Super Bowl; this song was the primary reason I wanted a MCC album, and I was concerned a live version recorded in a stadium during the Super Bowl might be of inferior recording quality.  But I needn't have worried, the sound is great, and the performance is energetic and fun, with a verse in Creole thrown in for good measure.  &quot;This Shirt&quot; is probably my favorite track I was unfamiliar with, but the entire album is quality; there are very few 17-track albums by any artist where I can say I enjoyed every song.  I now look forward to exploring her original albums.  I highly recommend this album to anyone looking for an introduction to this great artist"
1,"The remix sucks.  DOn't even buy the whole remixes on iTunes, they really are bad.  I will write reviews for their other remixes.  Nerd once again strikes out with another _________ comment.  The title is the NATO Phoetic alphabet, your stupid piece of _____.  Once again, you have no idea what you are talking about.  Becuase your stupid.  Tell me, could you write a song like this?    Your respone will be:  No, but It's stupid anyway! or, YES!  No, no you couldn't.  _____ off, your reasons on your pathetic reivew for Hooray shows how much of a dumbarse you are.  THe people who understand the jokes will know how stupid the BHG haters are"
2,"I have always loved Boz and everything he has produced so far.  So, when I read the reviews in preparation to purchase this album, I shook my head and said to myself, ""Some people are just way too picky!  How bad could the drums be?""  Well, I found out.  The drum track in this album ranges from ""mildly irritating"" to ""AAARRRRGGGHHHHH! Somebody shoot the drummer, please!""  The constant brushes on the cymbals on ALMOST EVERY SONG creates a background noise that makes you feel like you're listening to a radio station that isn't quite tuned in to the proper frequency.  I was SO disappointed, because Boz does such a beautiful job singing these lovely songs.  I can't make myself enjoy them, however, because I can't get my focus off of that freakin' drum noise!  So, if you think some of the previous reviewers are just trying to be a little aurally precious, I assure you that they have put forth valid points - points with which I sadly concur.  Can somebody tell Boz to remix this thing and cut out Irritating Cymbals Guy?  Sheesh. "
1,"I loved Amanda's first two albums. But this? Some of the dumbest lyrics I've ever heard. This cd totally sucks. Buy her first 2  cd's, but don't touch this one!! I love her, but this cd is rotten to the core"
5,Very energetic and extremely well done.  Excellent guitarists.  They really beat on those guitars
1,"Puddle of Mudd exploded into the contemporary pop/rock scene around 2000.  This album is representative of their entire catalogue.  For those music fans who want to hear true hard rock, pick up a good copy of any early Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath.  For anyone wanting true grunge, pick up any copy of an Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, or Nirvana album.  Puddle of Mudd shamelessly (and inaccurately) self-promotes their band/sound as both hard-rock and grunge, while living up to neither.  Since most of their fans seem to be pretty young, they've been able to pull this sham off, mainly because their audience has never been exposed to any of the aforementioned bands...and honestly has no desire to listen to any older music.  The songs on this album are extremely redundant, with little variation of riffs or overall aesthetics from one track to the next.  The lyrics are horribly compiled to offer nothing more than a vocal rhythm and subpar content.  This album is a waste of both time and money for anyone interested in listening to any worthwhile rock"
2,"Sony botched the 1996 re-master by not preserving the original segue-way that bridged ""Lovin Touchin Squeezin"" and ""City of The Angels"".  They have failed to correct this error with this newer, supposedly ""re-masterd"" version.    On the original vinyl release, ""City Of The Angels"" kicked in before the final chorus of ""Lovin Touchin Squeezin"" had completely faded to silence - presenting a similar effect that had been utilized for ""Feelin' That Way/Anytime"" on Infinity.  At the time, some AOR radio stations even played these two tracks together.  As completely seperate tracks on CD, the famous ending of ""Lovin Touchin Squeezin"" becomes clumsy as the final tones of reverb are cut off abruptly. Ultimately, it is only a couple seconds cut off (reverb echoing to silence) - But as one of Journey's signature tunes, you'd think that they'd have taken the time to get it right and preserver the original context of the release.  The original ending of 'Lovin Touchin Squeezin"" (with final seconds of reverb) can be heard on the two disc collection, Essential Journey - but of course, as the set is a collection of radio songs, it does not segue into ""City Of The Angels"" as it originally did (and should) on Evolution.  A minor point I know.  BUT - Sony is clearly trying to honor and replicate the original release. They should take the time to check all the details to get it right.  Or - why bother"
4,"I don't know why this is the only later ""Slave"" album released on Cd. Besides their first album, the others are missing in action. I guess Rhino felt that this was their most popular. But Slave had alot of ""sleeper"" cuts that the world should hear. I hope that they will eventually see the light of day. This band was unstoppable, and they put out some of the best music in the 80's along with One Way, Bar-kays, Con-funk-shun, and Cameo. This album is [] good!!"
1,"Dudes.  This is the worst ever.  You gotta be kidding me.  Life is short.  Don't do it to yourself.  Please.  Do not buy this album.  It is so cheesy it hurts.  Get some Heavenly, older Belle and Sebastian, the Beach Boys. If you like these guys then you probably like the Barenaked Ladies.  And if you like these guys and you say you hate the barenaked ladies, then you are a hipster.  My bad.  I am dumb"
1,"woww oh yea um no talent. not fun to listen to, way to much unneccessary screaming. nothing goes well with anything. this is the only screamo band tht can give me a headache..sorry. the only ok song is TO the Readers. All the other ones are repetitive and just are not goo"
1,"I don't know. I loved EC and I loved country...I even went to see him on the tour afterwards...what a waste of my precious time back then...and of my money. This is self-indulgent and badls played...I do not understand the point really. Buy some real country instead...George Jones, Johnny Cash, anything instead.."
1,"This is at best a rip-off of the tremendous talent we have come to know as Shinia Twain, COUNTRY singer.  This music may have done well and good in it's time, but Shinia is a bonafide Country Queen now and for anyone to use her name and status to capitalize on anything but the country music star we have all come to know and love is a rip-off.  Yes, this album  is a rip-off as is. Were it presented as Shinia (Eileen), circa 1990, ""Disco queen"" It would have been a fairer description of this music then what it was.  Can I get my money back?  3of4 El centro, CA"
5,"Its sinful that such a great album doesnt have a 5 star average. This is quality thrash metal right here, with a slightly refined sound to it. All the songs have blistering solos, crazy as hell riffs, and of course, Paul Bostaphs inhuman drumming, which brings me to another a point. PAUL BOSTAPH IS JUST AS GOOD AS DAVE LOMBARDO YOU F-ING RETARDS!!!!!! GET IT THROUGH YOUR F-ING SKULLS.   Sorry, I had to get that out. But seriously, just listen to the crazy intro to Killing Fields, his crazy pummeling in Dittohead, and his double bass madness in SS-3. This is Slayer, quality Slayer, and all the b-chin needs to stop. Im betting about half of you who are trashing this album havent even listened to it, like the retards reviewing Trivium and Unearth. If your like those Sepultura and Anthrax fans who refuse to move out of the 80s and early 90s, than so be it. Your loss.  As for me, my favorite tracks are Killing Fields, SS-3, Mind Control, 213, and Dittohead.  If my review has convinced you to have a positive attitude about change, get Diabolus in Musica, this, and God Hates Us All. Also get some of Pauls work with Exodus, Forbidden, and Testament if you need further proof of his excellency"
5,"After watching the movie Friday, you will know that this is a must-have soundtrack. Though alot of gangsta/hardcore, some R&B or funk tracks like i heard it through the grapvine or you got me wide open, mary jane, i wanna get next to you, ect. wut makes this a five star album is awesome beats on superhoes, and phat lyrics on lettin niggas know .  If u want a real soundtrack, then friday is the perfect soundtrack 4 u. Best Songs: 2. Dr.Dre - Keep There Heads Ringin' 4. Threat - Lettin' Niggas Know 5. Cypress Hill - Roll It Up, Light It Up, Smoke It Up 6. Mack 10 - Take A Hit 11. Funkdoobiest - Superhoes  13. E-A Ski - Blast If I Have To "
5,"I've seen (heard--whatever) Klute spin a few times, and he is unbelievable. Mostly dark , hard stuff (which is my taste--see his Breakbeat Science Exercise mix CD). This orginally produced music by him brings out some different tastes I didn't realize he had in him. I'm not going to get into his ""collage of genres"" cd (#2) [revision--I actually wrote this review before I had given disc #2 a full listen. There is some really good sh** here--especially for you breaks/ party dj's--that would probably never think to look in a D&B's producers direction for such trax--check ""Artificial Sense"" and ""Overchoice""], but cd #1 has a lot of flavours on it. I'm not a big 2 step fan, but ""Part of Me"" is completely addicting. ""Problem Reaction"" and ""Tacky""--(""Ether"" falls somewhere in between 2 step & jungle)-- are typical Klute standouts, and only he and High Conrast could even get me in the 2 stepping groove (if you can call it that). According to silly people who don't have a clue about music, D&B is fading as a genre. But w/ more producers like Klute (and High Contrast) around, it will be here to stay."
5,"This has always been my favorite John Lennon album because the production is fantastic and the songwriting is ecclectic and creative...  I also believe that this is probably the most consistent post solo-Beatle release because of all fab four post solo recordings, the album's production is flawless...  In 1973, Lennon told Rolling Stone that he had really enjoyed Paul's Band on the Run because he felt it was conceptual... thus, I've entertained the possibility that this album is in part, a response to Band on the Run because it displays conceptualism  and ecclectisism.   Like Band on the Run, Walls and Bridges displays The Beatles' unique ability to go from beautiful lush ballads to rocking rockers... at times, I feel like I'm listening to the White Album....the pentatonic 'Going Down on Love' tracks to the up-tempo, brisk, jazzy 'Whatever Gets You Thru The Night'... then, there's the soft Harry Nilson assisted number 'Old Dirt Road'... then John immidiately answers this mellow country song with 'What You Got' (which feels kind of like 'Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except For Me and My Monkey') and so on ... it has been suggested that John's '#9 Dream' was a subconscious tribute to George... I love this album because I feel that John is in harmony with his other Beatle compatriots  and that he's no longer bitter with his past like he was on Plastic Ono Band..  'Surprise Surprise' with Elton John even has a quotation from a Beatle's song... see if you can guess what it is...!!!  This is the first post Beatles album that really really sounds like something the Beatles would have been truly worthy of producing (unlike Band on the Run that although was a milestone for Paul only sustained mediocre production!!!)  This is also a fun album and along with All Things Must Pass and Tug of War, it stands as the best produced post Beatles recording.. If you're a Beatle's fan but think that there wasn't any good solo Beatle's album.... sit down on a quiet Sunday evening with a friend or two in front of a fire with some hot cocoa, sit back, and enjoy a great album!!"
1,buy it so you can set it on fire. it'll be one of the most ENJOYABLE experiences you'll ever have. trust me on this one. it's like the biggest smallest victory one could ever achieve
2,"I remember Christmas a couple years back, when I saw a CD wrapped under the tree. Hoping it would either be by the Beatles or a computer game, I eagerly unwrapped it. I thought, oh no not pop music, but gave it a chance anyway. I'm sorry I did. The first three songs are all raps, and you know my feelings toward rap (If you don't, I hate it.) Hot In Herre is on my list of overrated songs, although Weird Al's parody, Trash, is hilarious. A bunch of boring songs, then Landslide, which is okay...more boring songs...No Doubt? Dear God, don't let them hurt me! More boring songs...hey, Hero, that's good, Don't Know Why is too. More boring songs...In My Place, that one's good...more boring songs...ONE LAST BREATH? MAKE IT STOP!!!!!!!! Don't buy this."
1,"I can see why I saw the cassette version of this album in $1.99 bins in the '90s.  Chicago's 21st album was the worst album to me, easily the worst I've heard from them. The album sounds so boring, and the performances sound so uninspiring. Even the Diane Warren-written song sounds lousy, typical of her sappy ballad pap!  There's not one memorable song on here, compared to classics like If You Leave Me Now, Love Me Tomorrow or others. Don't hear a lot of their famous horns, only keyboards and pop songs.  And Ron Nevison produced this overproduced, overwrought fluff? If Chicago, with their extensive catalog, even thinks about performing one song from this album live, you might want to walk out of the theater to get concessions.  They are too multi-talented a band to let themselves get through this commercial flop that this album was in 1991! "
5,"and I'm still listening to this gem. To be honest, I bought this IN SPITE of ""Kiss From a Rose"". I hated that Seal was getting SO MUCH air play becaus of that song... not that the song was bad or anything, but I fell in love with his first album, and I thought ""Kiss From a Rose"" paled in comparison to tracks like: ""Future Love Paradise"" and ""Violet"".  All these years later, I can still enjoy listening to this CD. I am writing this review because I just popped it in while at work. There isn't a bad track on this thing"
2,"The old timers like me back in the inner cities where Smokey and the Miracles orginally put their stake down in Motown and R&B royalty, used to call him Bill Smokey Robinson. Whenever I meet someone who recalls the days back in the early to mid sixties when the black transistor made in Japan radios were blaring down the New York City school hallways playing The Tracks of my Tears, Shop Around, OOO Baby Baby (which brings back memories of my first interacial slow dance in the Junior High School gym) and the Tears of a Clown, all selections being on The Ultimate Collection~Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, I know that my buddy remembers Smokey's spindly aura on the stage and his silky smoooth and relaxed delivery. I apologize to my readers for run on sentences but Smokey requires such detailed explanation as a legendary contributor to soul, R&B and the Motown wall of sound (they had one too) that my effusive and continuing acclamation of this cherished and enormously loved performer is understated. I heard that Smokey recently brought his performance to Flint, Michigan or maybe some other backyard town in auto country. I really wish that I could have been there to see Smokey put out before a hometown crowd. That must have been nothing short of a miracle. I am going to hit the click button now myself, I need to hear again the sounds that captivated all of us when we walked down the hallways in Junior High with the made in Japans, fingerpopping all the way. Please note, I meant to push 5 stars on this CD and cannot figure out how to correct the above. I apoligize for any misunderstanding however everybody who has ever been touched by Smokey's music probably realized this faux pas.  Jay Adler,    Massapequa, New Yor"
4,"Sometime not too long ago, Bireli Lagrene decided to stop running away from his God-given talent to play exactly as Django Reinhard, and instead embrace it. This record is in my opinion far better than Gypsy Project, which suffers from some highly irritating violin playing. For some viciously swinging gypsy jazz featuring  Bireli's astounding lines, I recommend Move! as well as the even better Routes to Django, recorded when Bireli was 13 years old."
1,I didn't like Keep Right album at all and i was very disappointed.
2,"Well, let's put it this way ...  I bought this when the vinyl was first released.  Went with all the other APP albums I had.  My 700 or so vinyl discs have since been entrusted to an old friend.    I've since purchased *almost* all the APP CDs that I once had on vinyl.  Not this one.    For me, Pyramid was the pinnacle -- 5 stars.  Love the rest of the first four, as well as Stereotomy and Gaudi -- 4 stars.  I'd give 3 stars to Vulture Culture and Eye in the Sky.  But this one and Eve just didn't do it for me.  On a tangentially related note ... if you haven't heard Godley & Creme's Goodbye Blue Sky, try to find yourself a copy.  A rollicking good time"
5,"If you were wondering why so many musicians and critics (and fans) think so highly of Joni Mitchell's work, or if you've heard a few songs and would like to hear a broader sampling, Dreamland is the answer. It offers the heyday pop hits (Free Man in Paris, Help Me) some early folky touchstones, (Big Yellow Taxi, Circle Game), a selection from the fantastic jazz-rock masterpiece Hejira (Furry Sings the Blues), a delightful 80s comedy-drama with Billy Idol and Tom Petty in guest roles (Dancin' Clown) and much more, including some late career orchestral reinventions of earlier songs (Amelia, Both Sides Now). Dreamland is a delicious taste of the diverse and delightful Joni Mitchell catalog."
5,"Zevon become famous with ""Werewolves of London,"" a satirical critique of the world's womanizers (past and present), but as true Zevon fans know, there was much more to this man than ""aaaaaoooo, werewolves of London"" and a three-chord progression that is as infectious as it is cutesy.  The true Warren Zevon was a poet of sorts, a man who tackled difficult subjects (""Excitable Boy,"" for example, with a final verse that still gives me shivers), but still remained a sensitive man at heart (""Accidentally Like a Martyr,"" for example; don't deny, it moves you).  From the you-know-what hitting the fan in ""Lawyers Guns and Money,"" to the purely delightful recitation of ""I Need a Truck,"" to the heart-wrenching ""Tule's Blues,"" to the rockin' romp of ""Nighttime in the Switching Yard,"" to the world's most famous undead Thompson-gun toting anti-hero in ""Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner,"" EXCITABLE BOY remains a rock 'n roll classic.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it's a staple rock album.  It is by far wittier and more creative than most rock albums ever produced; sure, there aren't too many screaming electric guitars (oh my God, is that guy playing a PIANO???), but EXCITABLE BOY is quite simply one of the best rock albums ever made.  Warren Zevon was a folk/rock artist like none before him...and, it's safe to say, like none we will ever see again"
1,I never received the item even though it showed available.  I don't think that should be able to list items they don't really have available
2,"A beautiful song. But, the remix was a disappointment. I thought I was getting the original version. I should have read the fine print. This is the first time I ordered anything from Amazon, so I suppose I learned a lesson"
5,Lee Lessack Is one of the finest singers in cabaret today. His CD stays in my player and always will. He combines ability with heart and this is truly an unusual and winning combination
2,"1972's Elvis Presley as recorded at madison square garden is not Elvis at the top of his game. The numerous covers he performs sound awful. I can give the album a few points for having some of his best known songs on it,unlike some of his live albums. Although the set is good, the performances leave something to be desired.Forget about this one and buy The NBC TV Special CD instead"
1,I have listened to this cd many times and every time I listen to the single it just makes me mad.  The album version is a lot better and I wonder why Moby would want join forces with Gwen.  The cd's version is unbelievable and I was happy to hear it become a single.  I did not like Moby teaming with Gwen.  Buy the cd and see how much better Moby as an artist.  The music is much better and worth the money
5,"This is my favourite Ella record of the moment. Check out &quot;Solitude&quot;, the guitar player is wonderful and is an excellent listen in itself. Bravo to you wherever you may be"
5,If you want to hear a little Jamaica without going completely native Maxi Priest is the way to go
5,"I give this album five stars because there are five Top 10 hits on it. THAT'S NOT HER STYLE was a hit but did not appear on GREATEST HITS VOLUME 3. WE DIDN'T START THE FIRE was the first hit from the album. It tells about world history from 1949(the year of Billy's birth) to 1989,the year this album was released. THE DOWNEASTER &quot;ALEXA&quot; is about a fisherman's life on a boat called THE DOWNEASTER &quot;ALEXA&quot;. Alexa is Billy's daughter whose mom is Christie Brinkley. I GO TO EXTREMES has the style of Billy's Columbia records labelmates,Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. SHAMELESS starts off in a contemporary style and later converts to hard rock. STORM FRONT is another boat song. LENINGRAD is a ballad about a Russian man named Viktor and an American man and his daughter(possibly Billy and Alexa) visiting there. STATE OF GRACE really rocks. WHEN IN ROME has listeners &quot;doing what the Romans do&quot;. Then there's the easy listening AND SO IT GOES which is only Billy's voice and piano. The total playing for this CD is precisely 45 minutes"
5,"From the laid-back observations of Passenger to the anguished soul squeals of Turn Blue, Iggy injects a range of styles with honesty and irony.  From beginning to end, a perfect listening experience!  I don't think even one song is sub-par!  If you like rock, you must own Lust For Life! "
1,"let me first say this, Roots is basically Paul Simon's Graceland, except nu-metalized. these guys went to south america, cut a couple of terrible tracks with ""natives""?, then filled the rest of it out with generic nu-metal crapola with that guy from Korn cut and pasted into the mix for good measure. this is a particularily bad example of the vile and thank-you-god-in-heaven-it's-dead Nu-metal genre-meaningless pissed off lyrics, excessive ""guesting"" of other crappy artist, bad guitar, bad sitar(!), and the inclusion of anything to do with Korn, all presumabely done with band members sporting loinclothes and Rambo style striped face paint. the biggest waste of time, money, and matter. Its a shame that these guys are living and breathing and taking up space and resources that someone else could be using. A real bummer. "
1,"Nice package....attractive and it has almost all of the tracks by this minor group that you would want, but they took the GNP Crescendo album master tapes...complete with tons of horrible-sounding rechanneled tracks and grungy, distorted stereo.  The sound is no better than the old GNP CDs that have been around for years....which were 10th generation copies of the masters for the vinyl LPs.  Finally, the track are in no particular order and there's no information about each track fits into The Seeds body of music.  It's apparent that the guy who prepared this collection (Pat Gilbert) knows nothing about the era and is defintively not the guy to have done this reissue"
1,"wonder why there are 35 used copies of this cd at the moment? cause its craaaaaaaaaap!!!! like rockabilly?  like swing? this aint the place to find it...  setzer is nothin but a 50s wannabe who looks stupid, acts stupid and plays even stupider music.  there is nothing real about this music... it is a fashion trend that is no dead, so go home setzer in that heinously ugly hotrod of yours"
5,"Well, this album is pretty terrible, but I like it anyway.   If you're looking for an album to get you into Modest Mouse, then this definitely isn't it.    Anyone else who would want it probably already has it."
5,"Probably the best album of the last five years, alot more foccussed sounding than ""Life on other planets"" and miles better than anything else thats around at the moment."
2,"I disagree with the spotlight reviewer's assertion that this movie-musical was overproduced; it seems more to suffer from Spartan-like efforts in production.  I did enjoy the fact that part of Oz was in an urban setting (i.e., the subway station), but it looked like they didn't even try to clean it up a little.  But enough about the movie, this is the soundtrack...and as I stated above, it's a mess.  This classification mainly rests on the shoulders our ""Diva Supreme"" Diana Ross.  Stephanie Mills set the bar high, and Miss Ross did not even come CLOSE to that standard.  She was a visible, vocal and emotional failure.  Her renditions of ""Be a Lion"" and Home"" (my favorite two songs} were dreadful--in the latter she even sang incorrect lyrics.  She just does not have the talent or ability to effectively communicate Dorothy's character, let alone sing her songs right.  I would rate this with ZERO stars if it were at all possible.  However, the two stars are earned by the members of the original cast (especially Mabel King) and one addition: Ms. Lena Calhoune Horne.  She was radiant in voice and appearance and brought the level of inspiration and power up a notch as she belted out ""Believe in Yourself"".  They alone save this movie and album from just being a total misstep.  Yet, we still have Diana Ross here absolutely slaughtering the vocals and pathos of Dorothy, so all-in-all it's just a mess"
5,"Oreja de Van Gogh really's beyond comparison.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys imports as much as I do. Its really a mix of pop, rock, ska, raggae, electronica, and ballads. I got this CD thinking it would have the song &quot;Cuidate&quot; in it, without even checking on the back, but I wasn't disappointed when I realized it was the wrong CD.  &quot;Cuentame al Oido&quot; is simply mesmorizing, and &quot;Viejo Cuento&quot; and &quot;Dile Al Sol&quot; are really cool too.  Listen to the entire CD..it's good for a variety of moods.  Enjoy"
2,"Shlomo has become the heart and soul of Jewish music, even in the synagogue. His melodies are now 'davvaned' in places which once cursed him.  He was without question a musical genius whose depth of soul is reflected in every note and word he sings. In this early music one can already hear that longing, that love which so touches the listener. His voice is not great, but the feeling it conveys goes well beyond what is ordinarily given in most singing. He has the holy in him, the nearness to and longing for G-d. And he conveys that to us, so sweetly, so beautifully.  Oy heilegen Shlomo what would we do without your music?"
1,MONO SOUND JUST A REAL BAD CD
4,You gotta admit that this is not the same Genie In a Bottle girl showing up on this album. This is a very mature album and glad that Christina took charge of her direction in music. It definitely paid off and anyone who listens to it won't be disappointed.
2,"I vas very disappointed after I was listening to this record.Rick looses his fine sense for jazzy sound,and falled in a deep stupid commerce.I will wait for the next album anyway, but....turn back to your roots Rick!"
4,"I enjoyed this soundtrack, but I love this movie also! Anybody that doesn't like the movie is more than likely not going to like this"
2,"I was just a little confused when this cd came out a few years ago.  I bought it because well...it's Celine, and I adore her.  BUT...why did she release this cd besides to make some money during her absence?  I mean' C'mon!  Where's volume 2 or 3?  Are we going to get them, or are we just stuck with this volume 1 with VERY RANDOM songs on it?  If you're a Celine fan, get this cd to fill out your collection, but if you're not...don't waste your money.  If you want a Celine album, I would recommend All the Way: Decade of Hits, and One Heart"
4,"Tinkling piano and romantic songs turn The Intimate Ella into a smokey, late night affair. A very specific, slightly dour, yet beautiful recording. Not your typical Ella"
1,"Having bought Shaday and Kirya by miss Haza, i bought Desert Wind with the notion that it would be as fantastic as the aforementioned. Boy was i wrong. Gone are the heavy Yemenite/Israeli beats and flavor, as is Haza singing in Hebrew. Instead, I found her beautiful voice swallowed up by abhorrent 80's synth-pop cheese and benal lyrical content, with Hebrew only in the chorus at most. There is not a single song, with the exception of ""Slave Dream"" that I could bear to listen to all the way through, and most of the songs are laughably bad. So, fans of Haza's other works, do yourself a favor and save your [money] and buy Shaday or Kirya. Unless you want a good laugh, then by all means, purchase away"
5,"I love every track of this CD. Specially, 'Missing you now', 'Now that I found you' and 'We're not making love anymore'. He sounds so perfect for me and I completely leave everything when anybody plays his song. Great lyrics, perfect pitch and absolutely worthy CD to buy. ITS SUPERB and deserves more than 5 stars"
1,In 2001 during the (good ridance)time of your life craze they released a Cd to make every song accustic to like time of your life.
2,"Dru Hill had some alright cuts,but were a dime a dozen R&B Group. to me they were a Poor Man's Jodeci.sisqo had a decent voice,but seemed kind of gimmicky at times.""Tell me"" was a decent cut,but ""In My Bed"" was my cut by them.I dug the re-mix.everything else I could take or leave"
1,"This is a joke.  It has too much uninspired music from Browne's later albums, and leaves out classics like ""That Girl Could Sing.""  Sadly, there are no decent collections of Jackson Browne's music yet released, and fans will still have to get all of his great albums separately and make their own collections.    From other reviews, I gather that rock snobs are frustrated by the album's omission of ""obscure gems.""  And people like me who just want to hear the great songs we grew up with are equally disappointed. "
5,"Because she's like adult contemporary and I'm not supposed to like her because I'm not part of her target demographic but damn this CD is great. It's not surprising that the Grammy's picked this as Album of The Year. Even the upbeat songs here are not bad for Celine. It's a crime most of these songs were never released because they are so good, in my opinion, even better than her massive Titanic hit song. My favorites are Falling Into You, I Love You and Dreamin' of You. I don't own any other Celine's albums but I'm glad I have this one"
5,"You didn't think you've seen the last of ""The Annoying Thing"", did you ?   Well now he's back and better than ever with an all-new album featuring the new hit single ""We Are the Champions (Ding-a-Dang-Dong)"" based on the song by Queen.   Other songs include ""I Will Survive"", ""Ice Ice Baby"", and ""Copa Banana"".  In comparison to the UK import album, the US album exclusively has revamped versions of Eiffel 65's ""Blue (Da Ba Dee)"" and Rednex's ""Cotton-Eyed Joe"", two of my favorites.   The UK album, however, exclusively has froggy versions of ""I'm Too Sexy"" and ""The Final Countdown"", as well as the full version of ""Go Froggy Go"", the bizarre ""Crazy Jodeling"", and the even more bizzare ""Nellie the Elephant"".   Also there's ""Super Crazy Sounds"" which sounds so totally mixed up and around, if you know what I mean.  Either way, I like this new album a whole lot.   Better than the first, even "
5,"This disc contains three works by Russian-Tatar composer Sofia Gubaidulina, an artist of deep religious sentiment as is apparent in these titles: ""In croce"", ""Silenzio"", and ""Sieben Worte"". The common instruments in these works are the cello and the bayan. The latter is a type of Russian accordian played here by Elsbeth Moser, who performed in the Western premier of ""Sieben Worte"" and to whom Gubaidulina dedicated ""Silenzio."" Cello is played by Maria Kliegel, who has performed under the approval of Rostropovich.  ""In Croce"" was originally written in 1979 as a piece for organ and cello, but it is represented here in a 1991 arrangement for cello and bayan by Elsbeth Moser which Gubaidulina has approved. It is an exploration of ""vertical"" music (the organ or bayan) intersected by the ""horizontal"" (cello), thus forming the cruciform symbolism so common in Gubaidulina's work. Personally, I prefer the performance of the cello and organ version by Ivashkin and Hicks released by Chandos, for the organ just seems to work better than the bayan. Still, Kliegel's cello work here is deeply moving and worth hearing, less restrained than Ivashkin's but perhaps more passionately religious.  ""Silenzio"" is a fragile, insubstantial piece for bayan, violin, and cello in which the vast majority of the work is played pianissimo. It consists of five ""miniatures"" which all maintain the same rhythmic proportion 7-2-5 in varying ways. It is an interesting experiment, but it results in the least interesting item on this disc, and it's technical brilliance comes at the expense of religious power.  ""Sieben Worte (Seven Words)"" for cello, bayan, and strings, is a crucial piece in this disc, and in Gubaidulina's oeuvre in general. I have said before that the composer's ""Johannes-Passion"" may be the greatest work of Christian piety of our time, but ""Sieben Worte"" follows not very long behind. It is an acknowledgement of the tradition of religious composition, and contains quotations from Heinrich Schuetz and clear influence from Haydn. Nonetheless, the bulk of the piece shows the originality of Gubaidulina through and through and has an elaborate technical basis on the cello which is too long to quote here, but which is included in the liner notes. The strings of the Camerata Transsylvanica (ironically based in Budapest after the emigration of its members) under Gyorgy Selmeczi are intense and unfaltering.   As is unfortunately usual with Naxos discs, the weak point is the liner notes. The English and German are, inexplicably, two different commentaries instead of a common text translated from one or the other. Keith Anderson's English commentary is quite interesting but poorly edited and unprofessional. Teresa Pieschacon Raphael's German commentary tells something about Gubaidulina's place in the Soviet music community which English readers too should have been able to enjoy. Though Naxos was kind enough to provide commentaries in two languages, the profile of the performers is only in English.  These three pieces, especially the last, make an excellent introduction to the work of this superlative composer, and at an economic price. This is one of the finest works in my collection, and I sincerely and passionately recommend it to just about anyone"
5,"YOUTHFUL PRAISE HAS ONCE AGAIN PROVED TO BE A DOMINANT FORCE IN THE GOSPEL INDUSTRY! THE CD IS FILLED WITH SO MANY INSPIRATIONAL SONGS, INCREDIBLE CHOIR HARMONY, AMAZING SOLOIST, AND SLAMMING MUSIC.  THEY HAVE GROWN AND GOTTEN SO MUCH BETTER SINCE THE VERY UPLIFTING ""AWESOME GOD"" DEBUT ALBU"
5,"_blue_ is simply a masterpiece of pop-rock music! it has tons of massive hooks, sweet grooves, incredible melodies, awesome vocals courtesy of mr. jenkins, and dashes of experimentalism! the melodies soar overhead with his sweet falsetto voice, the drums rip and roar through some funky bass grooves, and the guitars strum delicately or spit out a distorted lullaby of happiness. as much as i enjoy third eye blind's eponymous debut album (which is one of my favorite pop albums ever), i think _blue_ is even better. it is impossible to deny the songsmanship on display here. everyone should listen to this album"
5,"The only reason i bought this is to make fun of it. sure it brings back a few memories when my sister had some of  his 45's. But in no way shape or form does this have any merrit or substance. Nothing aginst Shawn personnaly i'm sure he made a few bucks in his career, Corporate America at it's best! Ilove this stuff!!"
2,"With regard to concerns about the audio quality of the this MP3 version, the original audio CD version (""The Collector's Edition""), an 8-CD set, is still available from Amazon UK. I paid a little more than twice the MP3 price. The ISBN number of the Audio CD version is 0-563-47702-4"
1,The soundtrack was a total disappointment since I purchhased it entirely for the last track featuring some awesome guitar. I will be returning it tomorrow
5,"While Neil has written and recorded a wealth of outstanding material throughout his career, his albums have tended to be a bit uneven.  Perhaps that's why there are so many Neil Diamond compilation albums on the shelf these days.  This collection culls the best selections from his late 60s and early 70s UNI/MCA albums.  In fact, this set is essentially an expanded version of the now out-of-print His 12 Greatest Hits.  And while that album supplanted the studio versions of Sweet Caroline and Holly Holy with strong live versions from Hot August Night, this collection restores the original studio recordings.  Hot August Night, Neil's last MCA album before leaving for Columbia, is represented with the stellar live version of Cherry, Cherry.  But as good as that version is, I would have dropped it (along with the cover of He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother) for Cold Water Morning, Glory Road and Two-Bit Manchild.  That's a minor quibble though, as this set does contain all of the essential recordings from the period in breathtakingly pristine sound quality.  Several reviewers have complained about the lack of certain songs (Heartlight, Kentucky Woman, Thank the Lord for the Night Time, etc.).  For the record, this is a compilation of Neil's best work from his UNI/MCA recording era (1968-1972).  The early singles (Thank the Lord for the Night Time, Kentucky Woman, Solitary Man and the original studio version of Cherry, Cherry) were recorded for Bang Records in 1966 and 1967.  The best collection of the early Bang Records material is Classics: The Early Years.  America and Love on the Rocks were recorded for Capitol while most later era songs like September Morn, If You Know What I Mean and Heartlight were recorded for Columbia (beginning with the Jonathan Livingston Seagull album in 1973).  The best single-disc collection of Neil's Columbia material is probably 12 Greatest Hits, Volume II.  Fans interested in purchasing a career spanning retrsopective may be tempted to buy Greatest Hits 1966-1992 or The Essential Neil Diamond but both of those compilations suffer from the inclusion of inferior live versions of in place of the original studio recordings.  The career spanning box set, In My Lifetime, largely avoids the live version replacement issue that plagues other compilations but it suffers from its own share of problems, namely an abundance of mildly interesting (but ultimately unnecessary) rarities.  The most efficient method of compiling your own triple disc, career spanning box set is to purchase these three titles: Classics - The Early Years [Neil's Bang Records recordings from 1966-1967], The Neil Diamond Collection [the UNI/MCA sampler reviewed above], and 12 Greatest Hits Volume II [the best of the Capitol and Columbia years]. "
5,"Unlike some of the other ""Mondo"" albums, this collection may not be representative of the breadth and depth of Indian music, but it makes for great listening all the same.  ""Mondo Asian"" features primarily the polished, intricately textured compositions of R.A. Rahman, billed as ""India's greatest contemporary film composer"".  The CD cover continues: ""By incorporating western production styles and sensibilities to Indian traditions, Rahman has created a music that is universal even as it is distinctly Indian.""  Traditional Indian instruments and vocal techniques merge with western harmonies and structures to create compositions that are as fascinating as they are fun. Especially striking are the hypnotic track #11, ""Gropika Poornima"", and track #8, the mysterious and sinuous ""Suno Re"", which was written by Rahman's student, Vishal"
2,"I DON'T LIKE DJ CLUE,I DON'T LIKE JAY-Z,I DON'T LIKE MEMPHIS BLEEK BUT I DO LIKE METHODMAN NOT REDMAN.THIS CD IS NOT WORTH BUYING,I DIDN'T EVEN BUY IT I HEARD IT FROM A FRIEND.THIS ALBUM IS NOTHING BUT JUNK"
4,"Very nostalgic.  When I was a kid, Photographs was the first song I ever heard true ""stereo"" on.  Listening almost 25 years later, half the songs are pretty good, have are really kind of lousy, but the nostalgia is all great!"
5,"What can I say about Cracker's &quot;The Golden Age&quot;?  I have had this tremendous album for years and it is still fresh to me to this day.  It is easily one of my favorite albums, and I have a lot of music.  The album is awesome, consistent yet not generic. It hits you hard with bone-crunching guitar powered anthems (Sweet Thistle Pie, Nothing to Believe In, 100 Flower Power Maximum), then loosens up with catchy Crackeresque sarcastic songs (How Can I Live Without You, Useless Stuff) and then blows your mind with blissfully mellow thought-provoking tunes that sound out of a western ghost town (Bicycle Spaniard, Big Dipper).  The core of Cracker was and always will be David Lowery and Jon Hickman - other members have come and gone - yet not missed that much.  The Golden Age saw Cracker at an all time high when coming off their stupendous predecessor album, the platinum &quot;Kerosene Hat,&quot; which featured the hits &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;Eurotrash Girl.&quot;  Some may feel that this album does not live up to Kerosene's greatness, yet others like myself, find this album even better and more consistent.  This is a true great American band that has never quite gotten their due, and they should be recognized for bringing back fond memories of classic-rock bands like the Heartbreakers, the Byrds, the Eagles, Led Zeppelin, and even the great Neil Young with their tunes.  If you have not heard The Golden Age, or Cracker for that matter, you are missing out - so what are you waiting for?.  There have been so many flash in the pan bands as well as the other drek that fills our radio airwaves lately. A band like Cracker is truly a breath of fresh air and originality to the true &quot;music&quot; fan, not just some sampled, generic, over-the-hill, bubble gum, or boy band shlock that makes me want to puke.  The opening track, I Hate My Generation, speaks volumes to me about what is going on in the music industry these days: corporate greed.  This album, The Golden Age, in the words of Spinal Tap's Nigel Tufnel, truly goes to 11.  Five stars out of five - a classic"
5,"This is a great album with an insane amount of energy that if you listen to it. . .right before you go out for the night, run errands, take a long drive, then this is the album that is a necessity in a music collection. Though too much of a good thing, is never a good thing, so moderate intake with the previous album.  Switch it up, go crazy, do whatever just do something. I gotta run some errands now"
1,"I wish amazon allowed giving ""zero"" stars to an album.  I bought my first John & Yoko album in 1969 (""Life with the Lions."") I got ""ripped off,"" although I should have know better..  I was smart enough not to buy ""Two Virgins"" because of the bad reviews.  I bought ""Life with the Lions"" without reading any reviews, but I was young, naive, and a big Lennon fan.  Oh well!  The John & Yoko albums released before the breakup of the Beatles were all pretty much the same.  The chief instigator of these albums seems to be Yoko.  Her background in the ""avant garde"" and ""conceptual art"" is apparent in these albums.  The basic premise is: take a ""concept"" and run with it.  Keep running with it for as long as possible.  Let's hear John & Yoko call each other by their first names for a half-hour.  Let's produce feedback and screaming longer than one can normally tolerate.  After all, the big joke is that John Lennon's name is on this album... so even if the ""concepts"" are questionable and/or idiotic- lots of people will BUY this piece of vinyl because a Beatle has his name on the cover!!!  ""The Wedding Album"" was the BIGGEST rip-off I ever experienced as a Beatles fan and purchaser of all things Beatle.  When this album came out in 1969 it was priced HIGHER than a regular album because it was a big box!  The graphics for this product HAD to cost more than the recording costs.  The recording part of this project was interminable and amateurish.  Feel like hearing John & Yoko calling each other by their first names for a half hour?  Feel like hearing ""home audio"" of every inane bit of their ""bed-in for peace?""  I sometimes think the most ""conceptual"" thing John & Yoko could've done with this project would have been giving the customer an EMPTY box!  It probably would've sounded better.    Buying the CD version of ""The Wedding Album"" seems bizarre.  The product was designed for vinyl and you lose so much graphic presentation in the CD format.  The only blessing in the CD version is the inclusion of three actual SONGS.  However, the three actual songs are Yoko's.  So maybe it's not that big a blessing after all.  All three tunes were B-sides to Plastic Ono Band singles.    I don't recommend buying ANY of John & Yoko's ""conceptual"" albums.  Do yourself a favor and make one of your own!!"
4,"First of all, I LOVE this show!!! I just got my CD in the mail...and i've already listened to the whole thing! I LOVE it!!"
2,"What I have come to expect of Rhino is thoroughness, and this CD certainly is not thorough, although what is here is of course done very well. Where are the hits Half the Way,Why have you left the one you left me for, etc?  I think this could have been a great collection if made longer, or possibly even a two CD set, although maybe they figured nobody would spring for that......too bad, it remains a &quot;couldve been great&quot;....."
5,"My sister introduced me to Richard Cheese and I think I busted something laughing at the music/lyric combo.  This stuff is HILARIOUS.  That said, my baby daughter also digs this music.  Sadly I am going to need to ditch this CD before she learns to talk or we are going to be in some deep S#@&T"
5,"I was initially sceptical of the Stone Roses and for a long time I never really gave them a chance. However after numerous recommendations i finally decided to giv ethis album a go and found (to my surprise)  uplifting and repetitivly entertaining album.  From the opening of I Wanna Be Adored to Waterfall to Bye Bye Badman to I Am The Ressurection and the bonus track on this disc Fool's Gold. What most impresses me about this album is it's ability to not only keep your intention for 10 minutes plus (Both Fool's Gold and I Am The Ressurection push double figures) and still leave you yearning for more like The Velvet Underground's I'm Waiting For The Man you could just keep listening for hours.  All in all this is a fantastic album well worth the title of Greatest album of all time (If not close), A+ for Squire's boys"
5,"What a pleasure to sit down and listen to such great artists, they certainly do not come like that today. Great sound to, it's like one is there, job well done by the sound people. I saw Louis Armstrong in Holland in 1959 and it will always be for me the best jazz concert I have ever been to. I recommend this CD to anyone. Aalf J Molenberg."
4,"Hello,  I like Armstrong and Fitzgerald together.  And this is the completed Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstong together ON VERVE RECORDS. The previous reviewers have a few facts wrong.  Ella and Louis did record Dream a Little Dream of Me on DECCA Records.  You can find this recording on Ella Fitzgerald: The Last Decca Years.  True, GRP has released a great deal of Ella's Decca output, there are some cuts missing, due from my understanding, some legal complexity.  Ella did record Baby, It's Cold Outside with Louis Jordan.  The track isn't included in any of Ella's Decca CD outputs, but it was included in The Complete Louis Jordan on Decca.  But, Baby It's Cold Outside isn't on any of the 9 CDs, it is on the EP that came in the CD box set"
1,"this is pure dung, I can't believe that Luca Turilli was involved with this cd"
2,"I bought this cd for one reason only- Kyu Sakamoto's ""Sukiyaki"".  Unfortunately, this 1994 compilation cd has a tremendous amount of hiss which makes for an annoying and disappointing listening experience.  You will be much happier buying one of Kyu's newer cds with better noise reduction technology, and as an added bonus, you will also be rewarded with his other material which you will not get with this bad cd."
5,What could you say about Lionel Richie when he started his career with The Commodores and later solo.  All fourteen songs were written by him which were all chart toppers of its time.  Let alone his music crossed genres over to country from pop / R&B tunes.  Only those in relationships that's worth fighting for will find this LP of all love songs pleasurable.  This has feelings and depths with the arrangements and vocal range of Lionel
5,"Protection was released in 1994. With Tricky already having success with his own newly made group Portishead, & with their massive hit album Dummy just around the corner, there was alot of pressure on Massive Attack. So on the album they used Everything but the girl's Tracy Thorn on lead vocals to replace Blue Line's female vocalist Shara Nelson, although she would return for the 1998 smash hit album Mezzanine.  The album begins with the lushous Protection, the groups sound has definitely changed, as it's more of a heavy beat than the first album & Tracy's vocals really work here. Karma Koma is next, this would be a very popular radio hit, and remains to this day perhaps the groups most well known song. Three is quite a dark track, again Tracy on vocals here, whilst the ellegant yet dark instrumental Weather Storm continues into the darkness. Spying Glass is a more of a hip tune, performed by Del Naja, whilst Better Things is a smooth sould tune, skillfully performed by Tracy. Euro Child is suprisingly the first rap song since Karma Koma (I say suprisingly as Blue Lines contained alot of rap tunes in it) Tracy's on vocals again for Sly, which returns kinda into the darkness, whilst if Sly was kinda returning the second instrumental of the album Heat Miser is definitely in the darkness. The album strangely ends with a live rendition of The Doors classic Light my Fire, but done in Massive style, it has to be heard to be believed!!!!  Protection is definitely different from its predecessor Blue Lines & whilst I'd definitely recommend it, I think I would advice people who are new to the group to buy Blue Lines first as Protection may be a bit too much for them to handle at first. The band would continue their direction towards darker music four years later in the smash hit release Mezzanine!!!"
5,"If you are newer to Bach's abundent solo keyboard music - or Angela Hewitt - then this CD is an excellent place to start. It features the popular ""French Overture"" and contains some of the more lyrical and ""accessible"" music Bach wrote for the keyboard. There is a delightful mix of Bach compositions here capturing the diverse musical styles from Italy, France, Germany and Spain.  Bach shows himself to be a true ""non-politico"" as well as the master composer by skillfully combining these styles (namely from France and Italy) to produce works of great appeal and mastery - but in a style that is uniquely ""Bach.""  In the opening piece, Hewitt does great justice to Bach's tribute to the Italian concerto style with a convincing ""dialog"" between lighter solo episodes (tutti) and the fuller passages imitating orchestral effect (ritornello) - all on one keyboar of course.  This piece is most famous for the Adagio which Hewitt infuses with much heart and soul by her delicate, thoughtful melodic lines that never approach over sentimentality.  The main event of this CD must certainly be the monumental ""French Overture"" (aka: Partita in B minor) - a grand conception lasting some 30 minutes repleat with numerous movements of French courtly dance influence and rich in imaginative and decorative keyboard effects.  Miss Hewitt wonderfully articulates these effervescent rhythms with supreme confidence and masterful result.  Her ornamentations are always tasteful, seamlessly integrated and truly enthralling to hear.  In the off-beat rhythms of the gigue, her semiquavers bounce off the page with great poise and the crispness of fresh-pressed linen.  And she shows her masterful pianism to its fullest in the curious final ""echo"" movement, bringing an brilliant, orchestral quality to it.  Hiding in the shadows of these two main events are four charming little ""duets.""  These are no mere ""fillers"" but delightfully catchy, two-part inventions that Hewitt plays to full effect.  Rounding out the program is a most unique ""program music"" piece by Bach thought written around the story of his older brother's departure (""Capriccio on departure of his brother"").  In it, Angela Hewitt communicates both its nostalgic sentiments with her gentle, poinant phrasing and dynamics along with the piece's festive celebratory ending with her effective creation of trumpet and horn effects.  In this unique composition, Hewitt succeeds to create a wonderful range of emotive effects in one piece.  Indeed, her carefree yet tight-on-the-rails style truly seems to bring out the best of Bach's keyboard treasures - transforming them into music of great vitality and charm.  Her approach to Bach is one of artistry, nuance and good taste (not unlike Schiff) but without the ""directness"" or the ""rough edges"" that can be found in other performer's approaches (Gould and Gulda, respectfully).  The many great Bach performers through the last decades have given us many ""pallates of color"" to experience, and Hewitt's colors are most notably beauty of tone, a poetic flavor, and graceful fluidity of line at its heart.  It is no wonder that Angela Hewitt has been heralded as ""the premier Bach pianist of this generation."" Just about any recording of Bach's keyboard music by Angela Hewitt is a safe bet for being among the top choices available, and this CD is certainly no exception.  It received the highest marks from both Gramaphone and Penguin Guides while ClassicsToday gave it a perfect 10/10 for Artisty/Sound Quality.  In all her Bach recordings from Hyperion, the sound quality of this recording is among the fullest and most realistically recorded (where some other recordings like her Couperin, WTC or French Suites are done with a touch more ""spaciousness"" but still with clarity).  Also a highlight are the scholarly and detailed notes delineating the nuances of the various ""dance"" types that Bach encorporated into his compositions.  In all, an emmensely satisfying recording from a top Bach pianist of our time.  Highly recommended"
4,"The Aquatics Director wanted the atmosphere at our club pool to provide a ""California Summer"" feel.  The Surfin' sounds of the Ventures really hit the spot...and made me feel young again"
1,"First the sound quality is poor - I had my stereo turned almost up to max and it was just loud enuf to hear.  Then there are the uncredited/unlisted ""bonus tracks"" - they are comercials/radio ads for Ike & Tina.  The version of ""River Deep, Mountain High"" is not the Phil Spector version."
2,"I was very disappointed with the latest album from Bon Jovi, a band that has put out numerous exceptionally high quality albums throughout their career.  Obviously no one still expects them to put out albums today that set the scene of what is cool music wise, that they did back in the 80's and early 90's with the classics such as Slippery When Wet, New Jersey and Keep the Faith.  Obviously like everyone else from that era they rely on the next generation to tell them what is the latest rage music wise but this album music wise doesn't seem to fall into the latest style or ignore the latest trends and maintain their classic sound.   The album is like a continuation sound wise of their previous album This Left Feels Right, which was a greatest hits album rerecorded with their classic songs in a way that emphasised their lyrics.  That was great for the classics songs hearing them in a new way but this style for a whole album of new songs really doesn't do anything for me or anyone else I've come across.  Have a Nice Day is catchy and fast enough to be a great live song and it'll be around for a while if not forever but I don't think in five years time any other song from this album, like with other mediocre albums like Crush and Bounce will be played on the radio or at a Bon Jovi concert (and make sure you go to one of these before you or they die as they are the best live band one earth).  I hope that the guys have a few more good albums left in them but this certainly is not an indication that they do.                      "
1,"Terrible. This album is terrible. All tracks the same. Terrible take off on the song, the dance. Wow, it's so bad, don't know where to begin. Awful. Simply disgusting, this musician should play different music with his talent. Awful. Terrible. Disgusting. No musician in the world would recomend this album for anything. Disgusting. Little tinkerbell chimes in background of songs. So ridiculously bad it's not even funny. If you buy this. You just wasted some Money. needlessly. I bought it. Terrible mistake. Disgusting. might have made me laugh from stupidity if it was a little better. Terrible. Awful. Disgraceful.  WOW WHAT A STUPID C"
5,As much as I loved this album there IS one thing better. That is watching The Chieftains and Mr Nunez perform live.  What a wonderful experience both are! 
1,"Simply put, the music is fine, but for what it's worth, you might as well see the movie.  Unless you have a hunger to listen to music intended for background music, just get the movie, you'll see that the songs fit better when placed along with the movie"
5,"Great Seller - This is one of my favorite cd's - Too, Too Cool!"
5,"I have had this album on cassette tape for some time, and decided to update to CD format. Needless to say, if it wasn't a fine album, I wouldn't have pursued this title CD. Fabulous as ever"
2,Yes this CD will put you to sleep in minutes.  Its the most boring uninspiring classical music.  The first CD was very good but this Vol. 2 is like most movie sequels....AWFUL 
2,"This album will only appeal to die hard UB40 fans and not casual fans or fans who loved the old up tempo sound of UB40 on LOL 1 and 2. This album only has 2 up tempo songs that sound like the old UB40 from the early 80's and early 90's. Download the songs Come Back Darling and Mr. Fix it, so you can save your money. I love UB40, but after listening to LOL 1 and 2 I thought LOL 3 was going to be a classic, but it is not close compared to the previous LOL albums and seems like it was just put out to make a quick buck because there was no passion in the music and singing, which made the entire album boring or like Reggae elevator music until I heard the two songs I already mentioned and recommend downloading. Those two songs saved the album in my opinion, otherwise it would have gotten zero stars.   "
2,"I miss the old UB40 stuff you could skank to. The beats on this album's tracks are too &quot;club&quot; for me.  Labour of Love and Labour of Love II are some of the best Reggae albums ever made, this one though is has  almost that &quot;industial&quot; sound to it that's so popular in Europe.   If it weren't for &quot;Come Back Darling&quot; and &quot;Mr Fix It&quot;  this CD might be a total loss.  So it gets 1 star for each of those songs  from me"
5,"AWB is a very underrated band.  Their talent is definitely for the mature R&B fan who enjoys funk.  If this description fits you, you will love Pickin' up the Pieces.  There were more great songs on the cd than I expected.  ""Cloudy"" and ""A Love of Your Own"" were THE slow jams when I was in High School.  I am so glad to now have this cd in my collection."
4,"Bernard Roberts is someone who I'd characterize as a master crafsman who can be relied on to give a good interpretation of the works without taking them over (e.g. like a Glenn Gould). The result is not just good listening but its makes for a recording that's an invaluable study aid for anyone who's trying to learn this material. Since the 48 are not just pieces of music but Bach's demonstration of styles and keyboard technique -- something that Dr. Roberts seems to understand very well -- you end up with a lot more than some CDs, a plastic case and a few sleeve notes......if you could only figure it all out, of course"
1,"This album contains one of THE MOST ANNOYING Songs I've ever Heard in My life... ""Afternoon Delight"".  The only good thing about that song is that is was SO Overplayed, that no one dares play it anymore while others are in Hearing Range! :"
5,"Thsi album is amazing, they use simple household noises and make it into music, these people are geniuses! This album sounds great, it's very insturmental. It's like a clash of noises and happy,cuddly things, and dreamy stuff! It really gets you thinking."
4,"If you like Huey Lewis, don't hesitate to pick up this disc.  It has a nice mixture of hits from the 80s, 90s, and today.  You can tell the upper end of Huey's voice has suffered a little bit with age.  But otherwise he and his (now) larger band sound great.  I especially enjoyed the new arrangement of ""Do You Believe in Love.""  As somebody who grew up during the 80s (when Huey was at his peak), this disc has been a real treat to listen to.  "
5,"Jeez, I feel like it's the 70's again; defending McCartney:  To anyone who doesn't get it: his solo work is not the Beatles. He never seemed to care as much about lyrics and ""meaning"", as opposed to John and George, but focused on great melody, harmony, and catchy, if sometimes almost meaningless, lyrics. No one seemed to mind when he did it with The Beatles......... All amazing. This album may be his best; simple songs, simply recorded, heartfelt. His tunes and lyrics can be deceptively simple ( Junk, Man we was Lonely ) but listen closely to what he's saying. He doesn't shove your face in how he feels, unlike Lennon's ""How do You Sleep"" or even Ringo's ""Boogaloo"". This album is the first glimpse we all got into who did what in the Beatles and, as basic as it is, opens a new door. Still on my top ten"
5,"Sweet Surrender!!! that's the song that got me into bying this album, and what a album! On ""move with me"" he takes me on a ride in the same vibe as the stones have. ""Get on top"" equally great with his sex frustrated voice in peak condition. The flow on ""Hong Kong Bar"" is simulair to the feeling you get from the doors ""riders on the storm"" and closing Make it right is dramatic as few. There is a few not so brilliant songs but mixed up with these mindblowers that just dosent matter...If you love Jeff then learn to love.."
4,"A nice later album from this all-star, all-gal trad band.  On this album, the Ladies bring in various members of their families to perform alongside the ensemble...The Longs, Maddens, Clancys, et al., pitch in, and show where the group's trad roots come from.  Other than a horrendous  version of Dan Fogelberg's '70s AOR neolith, &quot;The Leader Of The Band,&quot; this is a great album.  (I &quot;get&quot; the thematic tie between the lyrics and this album; I just can't stand the song and think it's really cheesy.)  Otherwise, this disc has an admirable mix of instrumentals and ballads, and Joannie Madden's piping is, as ever, a heavenly aural treat.  Recommended"
5,"This is different from most classical and instrumental cd's I have. It is neat to hear the euphonium showcased. You can tell that Adam Frey has a great sense of humor, the album art is fabulous! The album has a great variety, Flight of the Bumblebee is fantastic!  I highly recommend this cd for anyone who wants a little something different in their classical collection"
5,"Where to begin? To put it as briefly as possible, if you're an adventurous music listener you will not be disappointed by Blueberry Boat. This is the most inventive work I've heard since Radiohead's Kid A. (No small feat). Every style you could imagine is carefully melded into one, including the most wonderfully bizzare lyrics I have ever heard. No sense discussing every track ad nauseam, each individual will form their own opinions. I can only give this my highest and most urgent recommendation.  Pay no mind to the impatient simps who give this album one star and call it ""the worst of all time."" Sit down with Blueberry Boat; listen to it as many times as you have to. Those who *get* this musical gift from the Friedbergers will fall in love. Give it a chance and you may be pleasantly surprised"
2,"I was going to order this, having ordered Volume 1 of the same title, when I noticed that this has a track on it that is ALSO on Volume 1, &quot;Goody Two Shoes&quot; by Adam Ant.  Why in the world would anyone publish a 2nd Volume of a CD set and include a duplicate track on it???  RIP OFF"
1,"Having been a Glass fan since Music in 5 Parts and a R. Shankar fan for even longer, I eagerly anticipated this collaboration.  Individually, both Glass and Shankar challenged my listening in many directions.  When Passages finally arrived, it was a real disappointment. This work challenged only my patience and ability to stay awake.    Every two years or so I give it another listen to see if a new perspective emerges.  It doesn't"
1,My gosh!! Tina had made 2 cd's of All The Best is a waste of money on Tina Turner. Don't take us wrong we do fond of her but why would she made 2 times of All The Best?! About the same as En Vogue!! It's not worth on buying this one because it only has 18 songs in this cd!! So think twice!! the best cd's you could get is 2 sets of cd of All The Best it has over 25 songs in it it would save you alot of money from buying these 2 cd's for once tho... just my opinion!! Honestly for this cd we would give 1 star but the other one of All The Best that has 2 sets of cd's and has over 25 songs in it we would for sure give 5 stars for that one!
5,It's one of those cd's that makes you bounce and makes the holiday season more enjoyable. Boney James is good... period
5,"the guys in this band have a sound with size-12 shoes. if you like this band, I suggest you try the Allman Bros., Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Creedence Clearwater Revival. standout tracks are Rockin Into the Night, Hold On Loosely, Wild-eyed Southern Boys, Fantasy Girl, Caught Up In You, If I'd Been The One, Back Where You Belong, and Like No Other Night. the question is: where is this band? it's awesome. they need to make a comeback."
2,"I randomly chose to buy and listen to this CD because they are playing at Coachella.  It isn't good.  It reminds me of StereoLab but without talent.  Each song is more insipid and boring than the last.  The music is an unfortunate combination of beats from a dated drum machine, irritating electonic blips, guitar for beginners and vocal stylings that are wimpy and heartless.  Needless to say...I don't get it"
2,"Galactic decided to go with a big-name producer named Dan the Automator.  Dan the Automator took an amazing, explosive, quirky funk sound and gutted it of any soul it had.  I'm sure these songs sound good live, that is without Dan the Automator's overproduction and mixing (Drum machines over Stanton Moore?  For shame!  The horror!).  The album itself is flat except for a few high points - ""Paint"" is good, ""The Beast"" is funky enough, ""Never Called You Crazy"" is good, and ""All Behind You Now"" is a great song, or would be live.  That's about it.  The rest of the album varies from so-so to outright boring, and considering the amazing amount of talent Dan the Automator had to work with in Galactic that's a crime.    Crazyhorse Mongoose and Late for the Future are both far superior records"
1,Being the fan of the Rolling Stones I picked up this CD thinking it was  something similar. Well they do try to emulate the stones sound but fail  miserably.  They have no originality or heart in their music who ever lets  them make CDs should be forced to listen to it.  If you buy this you are  either a masochist or an idiot
4,"I saw this album when it first came out back in '99, but do to some hard times and a lot of other b/s, i never got around to buying it until the summer of 2004. I am huge Bone fan, they are the group that got me into rap, and i'm into much rap, look at my reviews and you'll see that i am metal head, but i love the bone!!! Layzie and Krayzie are my favorites, followed by Wish and Flesh then Bizzy. I like all of the members, but i love Layzie and Krayzie's delivery and lyrics. So after i finally got around to buying this double disck collektion, i was really amazed at the material on here.  First off, i'll admit that i don't like every track, but i'm a white metal head so what do you expect? but the tracks i do like, i really feel and appreciate them. The moods this album can put me through are really amazing. One minute you can be feeling the fire from heated heavy, where my thugz at, thug alwayz, silent warrior, shoot the club up,world war. Then the next moment you can be feeling some more mellow beats but at the same time it's still cold blooded murda mo going on on tracks like murda mo, try me,thug mentality, these dayz. but there are even more mellow tracks too like Paper, Smokin Budda, That's The Way, won't ez up tonight. This album is really awesome, Krayzie tears up all the tracks, i love how his flow can go from mellow, to angry, to smoothe laid back sounding. Here's all the tracks that i like off this album and a rating for each.  1.Thug Invasion-An excellent intro 2.Heated Heavy-Krayzie's flow is lightining fast and as tight as ever. 10 3.Paper-A nice mellow track, awesome beat that keeps the song interesting. 10 4.Payback Is A Bitch-This song really makes me want to shoot some bitches up!-9 5.Dummy Man-haha, scandolous ass Krayzie! 9 6.Drama-I actaully like this song,it's really true that the b/s never stops. 8 7.World War-tight track-8 When I Die-i actually like this track, no one else seems to agree that is fire! 9 8.Thug Alwayz-Krayzie,Layzie,Flesh, and Wish tear it up! Awesome beat! 10 9.Thug Mentality-I like how he nakes off all the places, nice beat and lyrics. 9 10.Murda Won't Stop-tight ass intro-10 11.Where My Thugz At-Another tight-ass track-9 12.Try Me-i read a lot reviews that said this song was filler, but listen to the lyrics and you'll see why he wrote this song. 9 13.These Dayz-This song has some awesome lyrics and a great beat! listen to all of the versus lyrics! 10 14.Silent Warrior-This song is the fire!!! 10 15.Shoot the Clup up-Love this track! 10 16.Won't Ez Up-9 17.That's The Way-Awesome laid back track-10 18.Murda Mo-Love this track!! Krayzie tears it up!! 10  I highly recommend this to any Bone fan, this will really compliment your kollecktion!!"
5,"Mariah Carey's 1994 album Merry Christmas is the ultimate Christmas album.  She breathes new life into standard songs like Silent Night and Joy to the World.  Her voice is in peak form, hitting her five octave range - and I swear for this album - six.    On this new release, one side is a CD, the other has all her charming Christmas music videos.  The label warns that the CD side will not play in all CD players unless it is a Sony, but it played fine in my non-Sony CD walkman as well as my Gateway PC DVD player.    There are two engaging secular songs here, ""All I Want for Christmas is You,"" and ""Baby Please Come Home for Christmas.""  But the real power is in the classic hymns and carols.  Her versions are so full of joy and reverence for Jesus our Saviour.  I get tears in my eyes when I think of the Christ Child coming to Earth - the real reason for Christmas"
2,"HOLD THE FAITH: With his debut album release, VIRTUOUS WOMAN, Warrior King cemented a reputation as one of Jamaica's hottest conscious singers in recent years. Singles like NEVER GO WHERE PAGANS GO and VIRTUOUS WOMAN bust up the Jamaican charts, and established young Warrior King as a major talent with strong vocal range, delivering cultural as well as lovers' lyrics for some of the island's biggest producers. In light of such a powerful debut, HOLD THE FAITH turns out to be a bit of a disappointment. The album opens with an interesting introductory segment, and then the title track, which is decent but nothing to run out into the streets and shout about. From thereon out, HOLD THE FAITH rides a few crests - like the herbally inspired MEDITATION on the PASS THE KUTCHIE (FULL UP) rhythm, or the catchy sing-along, EDUCATION - but mostly hovers right around average, or at worst, sinks to sadly uninspired. Listening to forgettable roots-by-numbers efforts like FREEDOM and JUDGMENT DAY, there's little evidence that this is the work of the same singer whose compelling chanting style carried a modern classic like POWER TO CHANT to the top every reggae playlist. Even worse, there are a couple of performances - particularly the dreadful EVERYDAY - that sound like phone-ins; a real let-down, and not at all what you'd expect from an artist of Warrior King's caliber. Overall, I really believe that HOLD THE FAITH is just a misstep, and that if we can indeed hold the faith, Warrior King will be back to reward us with his very best before too long. Until then, this will just have to do"
5,Just buy it. You will thank me later. One of the most incredible recordings in musical history. Anything by Lemon Jelly is special and Lemonjelly.ky is also out of this world so why not buy them both?  If I could give this CD 100 stars I would
4,"Most people are familiar with at least Rhapsody 2 from watching Warner Brothers' cartoons, if for no other reason. That delightful piece is included but there is so much more! This is a wonderful album to enjoy.  Among my favorites is the short but delightful number 11 in A minor. It is a joy to hear but, then again, all of these are.  Do not expect orchestral arrangements. This is for the piano by itself.  Listen and enjoy!"
5,"The last great American operetta of the 1920s, this masterpiece by Sigmund Romberg and Oscar Hammerstein is given a loving performance by the cast of the 2004 New York City Center Encores production, including Christiane Noll, Rodney Gilfrey, Lauren Ward, Burke Moses, and Peter Benson. This is the only available recording of the complete score, including ""Marianne,"" ""The Girl On the Prow,"" ""Softly, As In a Morning Sunrise,"" ""Stouthearted Men,"" ""One Kiss""  and ""Lover, Come Back to Me."" What a treat!"
2,"When I bought this I was looking forward to the blending of the flute and the harp. I have Wind Songs and some Hilary Stagg and other harp music  in my collection. This CD dissapointed me. The flute is much louder than the harp and when I turned up the volume to hear the harp the flute became too shrill for my ears. My second letdown is that there is no passion or emotion in the performance. It sounds like some musicians playing sheet music for money. The musicians are very good technically, but they are performing music that they did not choose or compose and their lack of emotional commitment seems evident. Michael Hoppe wrote the music but he does not perform on any of the songs. The liner notes say that this is music to play in the background while having diner. Maybe that is what it is intended for, it's just not what I was looking for"
1,"Atlantic Records sure must be loose w/ their recording contracts. I don't see how this kind of drivel, regardless of the musicians' past records and reputations, could pass a demo test w/ stingy studio execs.  This CD was  simply self-indulgent and wasteful.  Froom is incapable of just playing  keyboards, w/out trying to overunderproduce a piece to the point of  absurdity.  Atmospheric just don't cut it if there's no compelling content  to hold it up.  And where's that killer guitar talent we know/knew in  Hidalgo?  Just a strange, disjointed, and goofy effort with no real payoff"
2,"My daughter needs to have music playing when she sleeps. That's just a fact because we in a house in the city. This is the weirdest cd I have ever heard. It doesn't really stop her from crying but it does sometimes put her in this weird daze. It does not help her sleep, in fact, it keeps her from sleeping and after a while, she is agitated until I turn it off. I'd say if you don't normally play music for your baby she or she may fall for this. I'd recommend just playing any CD that you currently own on repeat mode during naps. The point of playing music is so that when a baby re-enters the light sleep phase, normal sounds in the home don't startle and awaken her. If you feel that you must buy something specifically for your baby to hear, I recommend Woody Guthrie ""Nursery Days"" for your baby. It has become the soundtrack of our lives."
1,"this is the type of cookie cutter crappy late eighties dreck that was played on a lot of radio stations at the time. although, cheesy as it is now, definitely takes you back to a time and place, abeit, a very cheesy time and place. anybody still growing their mullet!(sic!"
5,"Probably one of the top 20 rock albums of the past 20 years, I still consider this to be Pearl Jam's best album to date. Possibly even Pearl Jam's career defining album, which is unusual for a band to be at the absolute peak of their game on releasing their debut.  Penned and sung by Eddie Vedder, without a doubt one of rocks great vocalists, this album has a fair few of PJ's best-loved tracks.  If you're relatively new to Pearl Jam's music, I would recommend you buy either this release or their greatest hits album, 'rearviewmirror: Greatest hits 1991-2003'.  Fan favourites on this album are ""Jeremy"", ""Alive"", Even Flow"" and ""Black"". Some tracks I rate highly would be ""Alive"", ""Garden"", ""Jeremy"" and ""Release"".  Still, if you don't fancy buying the album, at least download some of the tracks I mentioned. You won't be dissapointed.  If you're a fan of Pearl Jam you might also like The Smashing Pumpkins, Soundgarden, Audioslave, Alice in Chains, Stone Temple Pilots or even Nirvana. If you like this record I would highly recommend listening to 'Siamese Dream' by The Smashing Pumpkins, or 'Superunknown' by Soundgarden, which is apparently one of Eddie Vedder's favourite albums"
5,"I have this and the 2000 Hawaiian Slack Key Christmas cut.  Both are fabulous but if you had to choose one, I'd favor the 1996 cut for the sweet, mellow sound...  the old style"
2,"Warning:  some of the songs listed on the box are abbreviated versions and should be listed as such.  They fade out half way thru the song.  I was very disapointed.   Would be much better in chronological order.  It is in some places, but then jumps around for no apparent reason.   It seems like Barry attempted to show what a talented entertainer he is, and he is very talented.  It is just this box set tries to do too many things, and accomplishes nothing.  It just tries too hard.   "
1,"Don't buy it.  If you can get Carpet Man on another collection, do so.  He's better off not trying to be hip because he is not.  I purchased this for historical purposes, but if you ever wonder about pop idols trying to be hip, Tommy Roe did a little better with Winter's Day"
5,"Waller and Armstrong were of the same generation and were collaborators in music in the 1920s. Louis's first big leap to popular stardom beyond the tight group of Jazz musicians and performers came when he introduced ""Ain't Mis Behavin'"" on the Broadway stage. The audiences often forced him to do three or four encores.  Folks who had seen the show before would pay full price just to get in to hear Louis sing this one song.     The recordings in the late 20s by Louis with all the vocals are simply my idea of the best music ever recorded by anyone. Rather than get them selected this way, you might want to get one of the CDs or collections that covers that period of time with everything, rather than just the songs by Waller.   Likewise, while the All Stars were not as good as his original Chicago and New York Groups, particularly these later all-stars (I prefer the albums with the great Jack Teagarden), if you get into the music you will want that all too.       At any rate, there is no one else but Louis who can do these songs justice except the Fat man himself, Mr. Waller"
5,"This album PIANO MAN put Billy Joel on the map, even though his COLD SPRING HARBOR album was also excellent, but didn't get very much distribution originally. Of course ""Piano Man"" is one of my favorite pop/rock tunes in the history of music, but really this whole album is superb, and there's not one bit of filler on this one. Of course ""The Ballad of Billy The Kid"" is classic Billy Joel, and the same with ""Captain Jack"". The rest of this album isn't excellent but Very Good. Billy just couldn't do any wrong during his 70's heyday, and this was just basically the beginning of his huge success. Billy was probably the best pop/rock songwriter of the 70's, and the material on this album happens to be some of his best compositions. In short Billy flat out rocks, so rush out to your music stores and buy this gem of an album."
4,"Before I tell you all my opinion about this musical, I would like to comment that my recording is slightly different than the one here online. My is the original Canadian Cast. The cover has a gnarled tree against a blazing sunset on it...very interesting. For the most part though, the songs are the same. Some things have been added, taken out, or modified. Anyway, I got mine at a flee market and couldn't wait to listen because I was a fan of the famous book. I listened and was slightly disappointed with it. Marla Schaffel (I might have spelled her name wrong) has a gorgeous voice and plays the part of Jane very, very well. I haven't heard the man who plays Mr. Rochester on this recording; I have only heard Anthony Crivello portray him. Although the cast matters a good deal, in this musical's case, I believe the score and lyrics count a tiny bit more. Some songs are truly disgraceful, however, there are several that stand out. My favorites include 'As Good As You', 'Painting My Portrait', 'Secret Soul', and 'In the Light of the Virgin Evening'. I would probably have more favorites if I had heard this recording...unfortunately I haven't had the pleasure to hear 'The Orphan', 'Sirens', 'Finer Things', or 'Rain'. The music is over all very good once you become accustomed to it. The real quality that stands out in this musical are the lyrics. Lyrically, this play is absolutely brilliant. Even if you ignore the music and the voices...just listen to the words and you will most certainly be moved. Being that Jane Eyre is adapted from a novel, I expected that the lyrics would be predictable and insipid...everything they are not. Over all, I can enjoy this play for not only the musical wonder, but the breathtaking lyrics. Thanks to those of you who took the time to read my review! Do any of you viewers agree"
4,"I love this album. If you are a jam band fan you will love this CD/album. Some one I know thought it sounded a lot like the Grateful Dead when I played it for them. I bought this CD after seeing them for the first time live. They are a great band and are very ""together"" with their sound. Found this CD addictive and never seem to get tired of it. GREAT BUY!   I only put 4 out of 5 stars because they are still better live than the CD."
1,"I had read the reviews of this album and picked it up on the strength of the positive comments, but I was shocked at how terrible this album was.  Understanding Herbert's classical piano background, I expected a deep and nuanced interpretation of house that could combine interesting danceable beats with a solid 4x4 backbone, but some rhythmic variation and interesting found sounds from the claims of so many odd samples used.  The first thing that put me off was the terrible vocals, which combine the cheesy and trite lyrical stylings of the worst diva-house with the shallow wording of your local folk music open mic.  The rhythms were also boring, none of the more interesting layering ontop of the standard house beat, but a very shallow and superficial interpretation you would expect to find on a Casio keyboard.    Stay away"
4,This cd is light hearted and FUN
5,I definitely would recommend adding this CD to your ecclectic collection. It summarizes cowboy music and the cowboy mentality which I feel I have a little bit of. Extremely good for the confirmation of being single- it's  okay to be alone
5,"I am a 34 year old Real Estate agent who used to own a Dance Club.... Think 10 years ago going to school... My personal leanings musically are more 80's dance and new wave... I got into the Gin Blossoms, Toad The Wet Sprocket, Origin stuff in the early 90's but when Nirvana changed the style of mainstream music I sort of dropped out... Went to dance music and there wasnt much of it... These past few years as I was busy with a family and real job I have not payed much attention but about a year ago I found Synthpop and www.adifferentdrum.com and www.slothradio.com aside from the synthopop and Blank and Jones type stuff I have been listening to I also have liked a lot of the teen-i-bopper music out latley... really top fourtyish as it has a dancable beat and the best writers seem to have gone that direction for the money.... K thats a long intro for why this album BLOWS me away... I have all this stuff playing in my office to keep me and my staff pumped all the time and whats wierd is we have this server (iTunes) where everyone can choose from 90 gigs woths of music and with iTunes you can keep track of number of plays. In the past 3 months with probably 100 new CDs in the server in that time this one is on top of all of them with the Killers coming in second. Its sort of dark, but energy filled, INCREDIBLE vocals and it really makes you want to dance. Please... check out the different mixes of"
2,"as always, the dutchman comes through with quality mixxing talent. unfortunately for me, i felt there was a lack for outstanding musical selection.  i didnt feel like there were any outstanding tracks... nothing with a unique and outstanding rhythm. i like progressive mixes, but i have to say this mix didn't progress to anything outstanding.  "
2,"Alright, the song I am looking for is when the group is in Copenhagen I believe?  Cooper goes off by himself to the local Sex Club, where they proceed to have all sorts of fun with him.  I am looking for the song that plays in that scene.  Its not very long, and its in German, but it sounded vaguely familiar.  I have had no other luck finding it, so I thought I would ask here.  Thanks, ~dash"
1,"I bought this LP when it first came out.  I'd drowned my happy soul in ""Out of the Cool"" and got lost for months in the moods of ""Individualism"".  Add to that his ""Guitar Forms"" LP with Kenny Burrell and the ""Sketches"" album, I was ready for more of the pure Evanescence, and not ready for Gil Evans to do what most self-respecting composers do -- shift gears.  No, change cars.  In mid-drive.    This album was a huge change to me, and I tried to follow him but couldn't.  Kind of like trying to follow  Stravinsky from his neo-classical phase to his atonal phase.  Maybe he (Gil Evans) made it, maybe the other reviewers are right, and it's all great stuff, but it lost me.  No magic, no startles, no surprises that I could suck into my soul and thrive on.    So, be warned, be cautious.  It's a change, and it signals a change that he continued on for the rest of his career, and if you loved ""Individualism"", you might not make the jump.  Then again, maybe you will.  I just have to go on record to say all this, as one Evans fan who is disappointed"
5,"Joe Cocker teams up with Tulsa native Leon Russell and a cast of over forty for a concert tour, and what a party! The live set contains a mix of Russell compositions and blues/R&amp;B/pop/rock standards, all performed with the feral intensity of a man possessed. It's clear that the magic couldn't last in this form, and it didn't, although Cocker did go on to make many fine records, and even some great ones, after his jaunt with Russell"
1,"It doesn't get any worse than this. If you have any doubts as to whether Def Jazz is ""worth"" the trouble-- don't bother. To even call this repulsive mess Jazz is a slap in the face to a genre that has stood fine on it's own without the help of so called fusion Rap/Jazz albums. To the reviewer who named this the best Jazz album ever:     SHAME ON YOU!!!!!!"
1,This was a great disappointment. Waylon must have been in the bathroom and the muscians in the lounge when this recording was made! I love Waylon Jennings but the vocals are so distorted and the music so loud that it was very hard to tell who was singing. I'm sure if the recording had of been better quality I would have loved this
1,"My feelings are very mixed on the live performance by 2Pac. But in the end, I feel it is a CD that should be avoided unless you absolutely need everything issued under 2Pac's name.   The sound quality is terrible; it would not rate well if being issued as a bootleg. The CD starts off with a Live Medley, but drops in about the middle of California Love. Even the most idiotic bootlegger would not make such a mistake.  If you decide to continue listening, it is probably because there is a dearth of live material by 2Pac that has found its way to CD. But because of that, why would something of such poor quality be the best for a commercial release?   And at the end of the 40 or so minutes, it becomes obvious...Suge Knight was trying one more time to cash in on 2Pac's legacy before his label became totally insignificant.  The CD does not have the Amaru logo on it, meaning that Afeni Shakur did not approve the release. But Knight's name is written in bold letters anywhere it can fit.  After taking it all in, Knight should have done 2Pac's fans a favor and just made an appeal for donations on the Internet.  "
1,"I don't know what you people are talking about. This album is horrendous. Terrible, Peter-Frampton-cum-Boston arrangements of Velvets songs. The guitar tones alone are enough to make me want to scream.  This is not rock, nor is it animalistic. For anyone who loves this album, I recommend doing drugs. Or having some soul"
2,"Nickel Creek fans, obviously, will love this syrupy solo album by the guitarist of the aforementioned famed popgrass fusion band.  Presumably this mostly-instrumental outing is intended to demonstrate Watkins' chops as a picker, yet it follows so closely in the saccharine tradition of Nickel Creek that it doesn't do much to differentiate his work from theirs.  The album opens with &quot;Neo's Song,&quot; which sounds like a watered-down version of Tony Rice's note-bending flatpicking style; the rest of the album gets progressively muzak-ier and Windham Hill-ish.  Watkins has lots of technical facility, but his artistic instincts are hopelessly bland"
1,"I bought this CD thinking it was the 2 CD set I saw in the commercial, and I was wrong.  It is a single CD with only half of what the TV version has"
1,"All I have to say is this cd is not comprised of ballads.  It really frustrates me how stupid these ad guys are.  Ballad--A ballad is a story, usually a narrative or poem, in a song. Any story form may be told as a ballad, such as historical accounts or fairy tales in verse form. It usually has foreshortened, alternating four- and three-stress lines ('ballad meter') and simple repeating rhymes, often with a refrain.  If it is based on political or religious themes, a ballad may be a hymn. It should not be confused with the ballade, a 14th and 15th century French verse form.  Some good examples of ballads: The Devil Went Down to Georgia, The Ballad of Jesse James, Johnny Has Gone For a Soldier, Ode to Billie Joe  While there are a couple of songs on this album that are actual ballads, the large majority are not.  The same goes with that Monster ballads cd with all the bad eighties hair metal/pop rock"
5,"i was asked once what my favorite pavement songs were...     there are some pavement songs which fit certain moods *perfectly*, and at those times, i don't have a choice but to count them as my favorites. for instance...i was in new york a few springs ago, spending the evening with the girl i'd had a brief-yet-effective romance with the summer before. she was there with a guy; i was there with two other girls, mutual friends. the five of us were in an underground, literal-hole-in-the-wall-type bar, tucked away inside a subway station at 50th street (i think). the bar was called siberia, and was a total punk/russian (prussian?) paradise. every light bulb was red, and there was writing on every inch of the walls and tables. the lone bathroom stall had a gaping three foot hole busted out of the wall on one side, through which you could see only blackness. the sofas had long ago collapsed on their stumpy legs and fallen to the sticky floor, where they laid dejected and off-balance. cushions were missing and the beer was extremely expensive. i got drunk and watched her...got drunk on the beer and the nostalgia both, pressed myself into a musty corner of the couch, and after a while, closed my eyes. there was a jukebox. it was the brightest and biggest thing in the whole place. it had &quot;crooked rain, crooked rain&quot; in it. i played &quot;fillmore jive,&quot; wallowed in its brilliant decadence...i played it again then got up and roamed around manhattan for 5 hours. alone and happy.     that night, &quot;fillmore jive&quot; was my favorite pavement song"
5,"A lot if not most greatest hits collections have some hits and some padding.Not this album.This is one great collection.The five songs tacked on at the end made this album a must own masterpiece.If you like Al Green's 70's output,you WILL like this CD.Every single song is a classic.Ol Skool Al Green fans (like myself) might already have at least a couple of his albums already,but this CD sums up why he's soul legend.   P.S.:Do yourself a favor and pick up some of his 70's era albums starting with ""I'm Still In Love With You"" if you haven't already"
4,"Not his best album, not his worst, The Predator seems to fall right in the middle.  It came out just one year after his last album and 2 years after his debut (right after he left N.W.A.), so alot of Cube albums came out from '90-'93 (one each year).  It has 12 songs, and no guests so alot of Ice Cube gets heard here.  It has 1 classic, 2-4 I skip, 3-5 are ok, and the others are good.  Production is good for iots time buy you can tell it's defintiely from the early 90's.  DJ Pooh does 4 songs, Muggs does 3, Sir Jinx does 2, and Pockets, Mr. Woody and Torcha Chamba all do 1 song.  Every song samples an older song so it's not the most original of beats but the samples are mostly good.  For fans of Cube or early 90's political type gangsta rap pick it up.   #2 - 8 #4 - 5 #5 - 8 (nice beat) #6 - 5 #7 - 10 (CLASSIC -- great relaxing beat sampling the Isley's -- maybe his best song ever) #8 - 7 #10 - 8 #11 - 6.5 #12 - 6 #13 - 8 #14 - 7 (has a 1 minute intro before rapping starts) #16 - 6  O'Shea Jackson -- b. 6/15/69  check all my review"
5,I ecpecialy like the song Dirty Boots and Kool Thing but the rest of the album is great too
1,"This Was Joe Walsh in his Prime, when he was really Rockin' If your A james Gang fan, and you like live music, you really should own this ""CD""!  (Joe at some of his best!!!)"
5,"The other reviewers are spot-on exact about the loveliness of this music.  I shall only add that I gave my copy away about 6 months ago but am only now replacing it -- the tunes are finally sounding a little worn and faded when I play them in my memory.  This music accompanies YOU after a while.  It is a quiet conversation with a much beloved friend, a silk scarf against the wind, a warm bowl of good soup on a damp chilly day.  Enjoy"
4,"Great 80's sounding pop, but with a lot of 2006 uniqueness.  I love it"
5,"Leave it to cafe-ta to give its fans such a great deal on not only a wonderful cd, but also on an even greater dvd. This is a must have for all the cafe-ta fanatics... like myself. the dvd it great but i wish that it wasnt so edited. it seemed like they took a couple of concerts and edited them together... and sometimes not so discretely. towards the end of the dvd there are some scenes that cuts from them wearing one thing, to another and back again... all in the same song!... but other than that I LOVE IT... ive probably seen it about 50 times and ive had it for about 2 months! once again.. this is a must have for all CAFE-TA fanatics!!!"
2,Absolutely superb album!!! I haven't stopped playing it for the last 3 days and I am quite fussy with what I like. All the tracks for this album are wonderful and just carry you away with emotion. Fantastic peice!
1,"There is a reason why record companies who carry bands like Earth, Sunn 0))) and Teeth of Lions Rule the Divine ask very little for their albums: its nothing but noise. You would think that a band putting together three tracks adding up to well over 60 minutes of music would have something of worth on them. Well, don't expect it. Trying to make it through any of these band's work is like trying to sit through the film Shaoh without an intermission. Granted, I don't smoke weed, so I guess that leaves this music to those of you who aren't doing anything with your lives and who probably still play Dungeons & Dragons in your parents basement, while listening to the likes of Earth, Sunn 0))) and Teeth of Lions Rule the Divine. It just seems ironic and deeply sad that one must get blazed in order to like this ""music"". Drone metal was invented because the creators knew that there would be a massive following of losers just waiting to gobble up something that appeared to be visionary and original. I will admit, I have one drone metal album, Teeth of Lions Rule the Divine. I attained it because so many people on Amazon made this stuff sound as if it was the second coming of Christ. Please, do not waste your money. This is nothing but a novelty act that has long over stayed its welcome"
5,"The fact no one has reviewed this title before now kind of surprises me.  This records highlight some great work by Monk, Max Roach, and Art Blakey; in addition, this record marks the first time most of these tunes were ever recorded, and there are some classics on here.  &quot;Trinkle, Tinkle&quot;, &quot;Blue Monk&quot;, &quot;Bemsha Swing&quot;, and &quot;Little Rootie Tootie&quot;(a lesser known but incredible tune) are all featured on this disc along with many other wonderful songs.  The particular version of &quot;Blue Monk&quot; that appears on this record represents a very memorable highmark.  It clocks in at 7:36 (the longest track on the record, most tunes are relatively short, preety much like the Blue Note period length wise) and features some awesome drum work by Blakey.  It is really great to hear Monk in a trio format, he really shines in this scenario.  I would definitely recommend this title to any Monk fan, or anyone wanting to start their Thelonious collection.  It really sets you up for Monk's &quot;original&quot; piano style"
5,"This compilation has nearly all the tracks from American Graffiti's soundtrack, and so much more. This is exactly what I've been looking to fit my eclectic taste. All the hits are here, this side of Great Balls of Fire and Willie and the Hand Jive. Those two would have made this compilation perfect, but perfection is hard to come by when dealing with era compilations.   I wasn't around back when these songs were blasting on the radio, but I grew up listening to this music - thanks, mom! If you want to experience the sound of this era, this three-set cd collection is perfect. I've been looking for Maybellene, Be-Bop-A-Lula, Peggy Sue, Sea Cruise and Blue Suede Shoes and they're all here on the same set!  Try ebay before you buy here. I found this set relatively cheap over there. There were about five sellers when I bought mine, all vying for the lowest price.    This is great road music for those of you in my generation brave enough to try something new and break away from the Death Cab for Cutie/Outkast conformity we hear all the time on mainstream radio.   For those of you who grew up on this stuff, please let me reintroduce you to your old friends. This cd has almost all of them."
2,"I'm very confused.  Rap has turned to garbage in the blinking of an eye.  I got all Suave House c.d.'s and this ain't the Eightball and MJG I know.  It's only about 4 tight cuts on here.  The rest of them are garbarge.  The title of the Album is one of the worst songs on here.  I don't know why they got Swizz Beatz to touch this album but he didn't do it any justice.  His beats sound just like every thing else he does except worse.  DJ Quik produced a couple of cuts on here to but there just as worse.  The chores on just about all the songs are tired and plain.  This album is to damn slow and soft!  It's not a single song on this album to get you hype like Coming Out Hard and On Top of the World.  Even the lyrics are boring.  I don't know what happened between them and T-Money but they need to hook back up with him quick, before its to late.  I feel like I'm in a contract.  I have all there albums so I gotta keep buying them.  If you decide to buy one of there albums for the first time, don't buy this one! Garbage!  First Jay-z's last album, Wu-tang's last album, and now this.  Makes me want to break my foot off in somebody"
2,"This is definately NOT the Linda Ronstadt that I have loved listening to for the past 30 years!  I have been a Ronstadt fan since the early 70s.  Loved her Nelson Riddle big band stuff, her Tucson Sessions album with Emmylou Harris, and just picked up her ""Frenesi"" album and love it too.  But this... This is definately not the album to showcase her vocal talents.  I could not even finish listening to it.  The last CD I will buy without previewing the songs first.  Skip it."
5,"Usually i'm not the greatest Gloria Estefan fan, but this cd utterly won me over!  I'm not a super english Gloria Estefan fan, but her spanish cd's have captivated my heart.  When i decided to buy this cd, i was waiting for your typical dance music.  I was really glad to hear good spanish music because now a days we lack that.  Every time i hear it (whether i'm doing homework, easy listening, or reading)I want to be Cuban (de la patria) and dance salsa forever!  She moves me-if not her, then definitely her music/orchestra.  Beautifully arranged, perfect timing, and a glorious attack of Cuban beat/rhythm/love/spice/energy!!!  After this cd, i bought all her other spanish cd's immediately (like Mi Tierra and Abriendo Puertas) but nonetheless, this cd (Alma Caribena) beats them all! :"
1,"I have several of Mr. Thompson's cd's which I like, but this one is really bad.  Imagine listening to relaxing music, but some kid is at your stereo playing with the balance control, making everything go all in your left ear, then all in your right ear, then back and forth randomly.  After 10 minutes I couldn't take it anymore.  Someone else might find that relaxing, but I most certainly did not"
1,"Why do I keep finding that most of the theme songs are written by different artists on other albums?  Clubbed For Death was done by Crystal Method, and I know that for sure because it's on their album"
4,"Ministry's ""Bad Blood"" is the best song on the whole album. But could have added some techno like, Orbital, Aphex Twin, Chemical Brothers, And Fatboy Slim.    They should have added ""Come to Daddy (pappy mix)"" to the album. Or maybe ""Head Like a Hole"
5,These 1969 double disc live cd's...  I didn't like VU until I heard these cd's.  The versions of lisa says and sweet jane on here make later recordings of the same songs sound completely inferior.  It's like a totally different band on these discs
2,"This music is pretty intelligent, but not very interesting. The forgettable melodies hardly connect with the complex rhythm lines; on only one or two occasions on the cd satisfying harmonies come across.   I bought this together with Nitin Sawhney's ""Beyond Skin"", which is an incomparably better cd - Sawhney plugs in nicely with earlier work from Portishead, Hooverphonic, and even the Roots. Karsh Kale however, seems to pay tribute to Jean Michel Jarre's ""Waiting for Cousteau"".  During yoga, my teacher wallpapers her lesson with a whale sounds-cd. When I do yoga at home, Karsh Kale is a neat substitute for that"
2,"I listened to cd and I dont know how to explain this cd. I cant really explain to well I guess, but i'll try. The problem I had was the swearing. I usually dont have a problem with swearing, but the way this band did it ruined the cd. It seemed like every other word in the songs are F$%*. It sounded like they tried to damn hard to impress the youth by doing this. The cd held nothing speical at all, not what I really wanted to hear in a metal cd. If you want really inspiring music go and listen to a Hatebreed cd. This cd is alright, but the swearing was so stupid and out of place. HA! Thats what I meant to say, the swearing just seemed random and out of place. Thats what the problem with the cd was. Just add it here and there, not every other word. Probably would have been a better cd that way. To fans fo Throwdown, please do complain. Everyone has an opinion and that is mine."
2,"This is not up to par with his prior releases.  I did not care for his genre with this album.  I prefer his more bluesy music.  He has a greatvoice and is a fabulous musician, but this CD does not bring out either abilities.  It is a very average CD.  In fact, I cannot remember a single tune from it 20 minutes after listening to it.     I would like to see Jonny go back to the music that made him popular.  I don't believe that it would go against his new-found faith. "
4,"I caught this band the other night on the PBS show ""Austin City Limits"". Every song they did was unique, and very well done. The song that really stuck in my head was the title track from this album, More Adventurous. I'm really a fan of jazz, but I can certainly recognize talent, and these guys are headed for the top"
5,"I followed Anais from the TV show that discovered her ""Objetivo Fama"" and show after show,performance after performance,she was always the one to beat!   I always knew she would win the competition.  She is beautiful, has a strong & powerfull voice, great personality and a true talented STAR.   Her first CD just recently released ""Asi Soy Yo"" is a hit!  Her first single made popular by the great Ednita Nazario ""Lo que Son Las Cosas"" has been 4 weeks at #1 on Billboard Charts and the cd debut at #11...not bad for her first release....  I love the ballads ""Que te Pedi"" and also her reggaeton songs:  Sexo,Sexo and Suelta, they will in no time get to the top of the charts as well. I recommend this CD by Anais to anyone looking for a spanish album full of ballads & reggaeton. ANAIS IS HERE TO STAY!!!"

4,"After seeing Toni's show in my hometown Las Vegas,I was truly disappointed.  Toni's album is very good.  She leaves her personal problems out. However, her voice and personal problems were brought out too abruptly at the show!"
2,"This reissue could have been so much more. Firstly, the versions of several of these songs are markedly different from the original album, especially ""I've Tried Everything."" If they wanted to remix these songs, they should have just used them as bonus tracks! And the original album artwork is not here (the back shot of David Stewart is missing), as are the lyrics. And finally...these bonus tracks suck!!! They should have definately included the dance mix of 17 Again, which, here in the U.S., was the only hit version of that song!!! What a drag."
1,"With songs like ""I'd Rather Ride Around With You"" we know we're in for a nice beach ride!!  This is an inconsequential offering from Reba.  Just more ""fluff"" aimed at the teenage beach crowd.  Nothing to stand out here at all"
1,"I don't understand all the raves for this CD, I was so disappointed when I listened to it.  I've always liked John Barry's film scores but in this re-recording all life has been drained out of the music.  Where's all the emotion, the excitement and pathos?  Instead, every track sounds the same -- they're all filled with a melancholic boredom.  Give me any of the original soundtracks over this &quot;easy-listening&quot; interpretation"
2,"If this album had ""Desperately"" on it from ""Stick It To Ya"", I would've bought it in a second.  That's the best song on that album, a hidden gem that got a small amount of airplay nonetheless.  And with 8 tunes coming from that album (as well as 8 from its follow up ""The Wild Life""), you would've thunk that ""Desperately"" would've made the cut over ho-hum songs like ""She Wants More"" or ""You Are The One"".  As such, skip this one, the songs from ""The Wild Life"" aren't that great anyway.  Get ""Stick It To Ya"" instead, it's a better best-of Slaughter collection than this one"
5,"Martin Denny died last week.  The end of an era for me.  As a kid I would grab my father's vinyl LP's of Exotica and Quiet Village and transport myself to tropical lands beyond my dreams, listening to Denny's soothing sounds and exotic bird-call melodies.  Julius Wechtler on the vibes was one of my early favorites.  (I actually saw him, as leader of the Baja Marimba Band as the opening act for Wayne Newton!)  When all my little pals were buying LP's from some English group called the Beatles, I was kickin' it to Martin Denny.  This re-mastered double CD is a trip right back to those magical days in front of my parents ""hi-fi""!  And without all of the snap-crackle-pop of the originals!  Awesome!!  As long as Martin Denny's music lives, so will he!!  Aloha, Mr. Denny!  And thanks for everything!  Keep a Mai Tai ready for me at that big Don the Beachcomber bar in the sky!"
5,"Although he had written a number of film scores prior, John Williams  really began to score as a film composer with Star Wars.  Since then he has  composed a number of winning film scores, this score from Amistad certainly  being no exception.  As good as the film is, this music is good enough to  stand on its own and is worth the listen, even if one has not seen the  film"
5,"If you watch--and listen to--enough movies, you can almost name the composer of certain scores, they're so similar.  John Barry's scores to &quot;Dances with Wolves,&quot; &quot;Out of Africa,&quot; and  &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; (except for the Rachmaninoff), are like that.   James Horner's scores are a little better differentiated.  But the two  best, able to write evocative scores that capture the essence of the film's  story and make us FEEL it--without leaving us thinking we've heard this  before--are Jerry Goldsmith (e.g., &quot;The Sandpebbles&quot;) and John  Williams.  Here, like Goldsmith's score to &quot;The Wind and the  Lion,&quot; Williams is able to take a truly exotic motif--the musical  forms of West Africa--and mix it with truly American, if a little  Copland-esqe-sounding, music.  And that's the whole idea.  People were  violently ripped from their homes and transported to, for them, a place no  less alien and bizarre than Africa was to white Europeans and Americans.   And yet the United States was a place that declared &quot;All men are  created equal.&quot;  The contemplative, high-principle-sounding music to  &quot;Mr. Adams Takes the Case,&quot; is as stirring as the exotic  &quot;Dry Your Tears, Afrika,&quot; but in a completely different way. That  John Williams is able to do that in score after score is what makes him one  of the all-time greatest in a genre that hasn't been around all that long.   My only wish is that film score composers would more often produce true,  symphonic suites from their film scores that can be played by orchestras as  stand-alone, concert pieces.  I hope this music becomes such a suite.  Like  the subject matter of the movie--the eternal human quest for freedom and  equality--it would become timeless"
5,"This is my favorite cd of Vanessa-Mae's, and definitely the one you should buy first.  The pop/techno arrangements are very good, not cheesy and dated sounding like those on The Violin Player.  A must-have for anyone who enjoys the classical crossover genre"
5,"Good music is easy to come-by ... GREAT music is rare. What an incredible combination of talent Ritchie and Candy have! I've known of Ritchie of years, from his 'rock' days and always respected his talent. But Blackmore's Night is probably one of the most wonderful convergences of talents I've encountered. I wish I could say I listened to Blackmore's Night on purpose, but it was quite by accident. Nonetheless, I was enchanted enough to look into what they had done. I'll never regret it. They are unsurpassed in the music world these days. Candy's voice and lyrics and Ritchie's guitar ... it doesn't get any better"
5,"While I'm not always a big fan of the musical-esque style of Disney movies (although the kids love it, and that's what matters), Sleeping Beauty is one of the best orchestrated films I can remember.  George Bruns does a brilliant job of arranging Tchaikovsky's score from the Sleeping Beauty ballet.  The recording itself is decently remastered, and the small ensemble performing is excellent.  Mary Costa's vocals are flawless and almost supernatural.  If ever there were a disney soundtrack to own, this would be it"
2,"I don't know what I was expecting from Hubert Sumlin. Surely not a rehash of some old Muddy Waters' and Willie Dixon chestnuts that were done correctly the first time with Muddy's voice and band. This album was a big dud. Sumlin takes the songs and tries to sing them and tries to make his band sound as if they were recording in the same style and sound as Chess Studio in the 1940's and 50's. Unfortunatley Muddy had a better voice and so does Willie Dixon for that matter. All the session men sound like add-ons to the old band, not muscicians who can bring their own style and verve to this thing. Pretty weak effort by all, unless Sumlin is himself to blame, as a control freak who did not have the vision to see what he was creating,something that had already been created 50 years before.  One redeeming quality of this cd is the final cut, an acoustic number that sounds as if some originality had been finally injected into the session. Sumlin is in need of an editor, or at least a confidant, who could have helped him with a better song selection or at least a better and more original way of handling these tunes."
5,"Being from Portland, the Wipers were a band I always knew about but somehow never actually saw. Their heyday in Portland ended right before I turned 21, to my eternal chagrin. Greg Sage is one of the great unkown rock stars of all time, bow down before him.   Kurt Cobain wanted to be Greg Sage. Think I'm full of it? Listen to the Nirvana cover of D-7 on the box set, listen to the original version of D-7 here and then consider the rest of Kurt's music in that light"
5,"Wow on the reviews. They are much deserved.   I saw the Wipers live a number of times. Remember they formed in about 1977. So I wouldnt call them post punk, but maybe the first westcoast punk band.  The Nirvana connection is warrented, since Kurt Cobain was a big fan of the Wipers and saw many live shows.  I agree with the others, the Wipers arent a punk band. What is punk anyways. Im 44 and heard the Ramones in 1974, were they punk, no, they were pure Rock N Roll.  Greg Sage has a style that defines original.  Greg if you read this, I saw you a bunch of times at the Satyricon. Also some industrial part of Portland when the microphone hit you in the teeth. You missed about a half of sec, then kept singing.  Greg and the Wipers, thx for the memories.  Zenorecords.com  go to buy Greg and Wipers itmes.  BTW, Roky Erickson rocks. Check his music out also."
4,"""Dear Gordon:  Remember the days when you showed such promise?  Before you sold me your soul in exchange for super-stardom? You, Andy & Stewart really concocted a rockin' brew of punk, jazz, funk, pop sensibility and, oh yeah, 'reggatta'.  Heh heh heh.  Well, as our bargin dictates, you owe me another Mercedes commercial.  Reminds me -- Phil Collins and the dude with the dreds from Counting Crows owe me another Disney soundtrack and Coke commercial, respectively.  Ciao, my little corporate huckster!  XOXO, Beelzebub.  PS - How's the whole Tantric thing working out?  Better make it 2 Mercedes commercials."
5,"I'll make this review short and sweet, because I'm feeling lazy today. Anyways I've had this CD for about 6 months and whenever I pop it in my mind is blown away, and my brains are thrown in a blender. These guys have two singers, and they both constantly switch off between different vocal styles, the brutal death style, the hardcore style, high pitched screams, and it blends together in a way that you will not be able to comprehend. One thing this band does not do is ever sing like a wussy, no emo garbage here. Basically if you think you're some big tough death-core kid because you listen to Premonitions of War, The Acacia Strain or The Red Chord, you don't know nothing until you've heard this. No disrespect to the latter three bands, they are some of my favorites, and some of the best live....but this CD is something else. Now come to Colorado, Despised Icon because I wanna see how much chaos you cause live. Buy this if you want to hear one of the heaviest bands in existenc"
1,"Sadly, one of the greatest rock songs of all time finds itself on one of the most boring rock albums of all time.  To add insult to injury, the notes on the CD cover proudly boast of 'a full eight months recording' time, which had been 'preceded by a year and a half of reflection and writing'.  We're talking 26 months here, surely time enough to produce a decent album.  Instead, they produced their only good song, which I'll say again, is an acknowledged classic, only hated by true Eagles fans, as most true fans hate the classics of their favourite bands.  If an unknown band had tried to get a record deal at that time on the basis of the rest of the filler, I seriously doubt they'd have been successful.  For good use of studio time see what can be done with just 30 HOURS of it on Led Zeppelin I"
2,"I was very dissapointed in this release, especially compared to their past efforts. Not a single song stood out on this, nothing different than the 76432714 other power metal carbon copy bands out there. If you're a fan of ""Glory to the Brave"", ""Legacy of Kings"" or even the ""Renagade"" album just end it there, this is not worth ruining the vision of a once good band."
1,"Kid ""Rock"" is to rock-and-roll what Twinkies are to gourmet cooking.  He's a poseur and a pretender, who tries to mimick the attitude and style of those who went before him -- Bob Seeger, Rolling Stones -- while hoping that no one will notice that he has none of their talent.  Why listen to a pale imitation when the music of the true greats is still available? "
4,"Whitley combines dissonant electric guitar with acoustic and his songwriting style is uniquely his own. &quot;Automatic&quot; is the best thing here, but you can't go wrong on any of the others. I prefer this more  full-bodied work to his other stripped down acoustic affairs, &quot;Living  With the Law&quot; and &quot;Dirt Floor&quot;"
4,"we need the funk, and john scofield provides it. chill down and groove with it"
1,I am very upset - I bought all three and no onscreen lyrics - why would I buy a karaoke cd without them? I feel that I just wasted 41 dollars
4,"This is a very solid debut. A unique style of flow that seperates him from the pack, but easy to bang. Hes hot. Production is Q-U-I-K no C so u know its bangin. Lyrically this cat is a west koast phenom and highly underrated. For the majority of the album the feel is reminiscent of Quiks ground breaking ""Tonite"". Very close to being a classic. My reviews are for those close to the streets so if this isnt u dont be surprised if u dont agree. 6X9 b down or get klowne"
1,"I bought this never having problems from Amazon.com before.  They did not state that this was a Sony product and when I received it, all the CD had on it was a root kit virus.  It would not even play in my CD player.  When I tried to read the CD to copy and burn the ""WAV"" files to a new CD so I could just listen to the music, all there were on the CD was executables and no sound files.  Sony is very poor quality now and I do not want to buy it again"
2,"I am a Ry Cooder fan, and this is not his best. I was quite dismayed and it is one of the C.D's I never listen to. If you are looking for good Ry Cooder, this is not the one to buy"
2,"I saw one of their music videos playing at Walmart and thought to myself: This is really cool!  Another goth/rock/alternative band along the lines of Evanescence.  I happen to be a big fan of Evanescence and I LIKE the mainstream twist of goth/rock/alternative.  Most of the times repetative music doesn't bother me.  You find this A LOT in pop, R&B and even country.  It's almost common to mistaken a Mariah Carey or Shania Twain song for a different one.  In fact, Mariah even made a remix that blended 2 of her songs.    To get back on track, I liked the female vocal.  The songs didn't allow her full potential of her talent.  The male vocals were ok.  I wasn't looking for a strictly GOTH or strictly METAL band but a mix of the two.  I happen to like it when artists experiment with music.  Otherwise Linkin Park wouldn't exist (love 'em too).  None of the songs really grabbed my attention.  Normally, there would be at least one or two I'd really listen to on a CD.  I didn't catch the name of the one that was in the music video @ Walmart so after I bought it I tried to pick it out.  I kept thinking to myself: this one must be it!  But when I get to the next one I think: wait, this one might be it!  Then they all sounded the same so I gave up.  I really tried to be open minded & and almost forced myself to pick out at least one song that would rectify purchasing a whole CD for.  But they were all pretty bland.  I don't think I've ever been so disappointed over an album purchase.  Due to the attempt at the mainstream rock/goth I gave it the extra star"
5,"once again maiden brings it all and creates another masterpiece. aces high is no doubt one of the greatest opening tracks ever, followed by the live favorite 2 minutes to midnight another solid rocker. the middle of the cd is filled with solid songs, that are all pretty much straight forward rockers. then comes powerslave which has one of my favorite solo portions. then it ends with rhynme of the ancient mariner, the second best epic they have. this would be a good introductory album for people new to maiden.  UP THE IRONS!!"
1,I never received the CD from Amazon despite seveeral e-mails to track down my order . I asked American Express to cancel my charges since there wasn't any response from Amazon 
2,"Yup..those are two of the biggest problems with Day of fire. They have an overused hard rock/grunge sound to begin with, and all the songs on the album sound exactly the same. Cornerstone, Through the fire and Time stand out on their on, whereas the rest of the songs sound too formulated. Hopefully there next release will be a bit more creative"
2,"As a fan of Buth and his song contributions to the Flatlanders, I was disappointed to find many of the songs to be unsubtle, strident polemics against war  or the obstacles to peace.  The melodies were not memorable.  It is in sharp contrast to Neil Youngs most recent release dealing with the same topic. "
5,Good music from a truly funny film. Aretha at her finest. Belushi can sing! Great interprettions of Chicago style blues. A must have for your soundtrack or pop collection. Good party record too
4,"There are often times where we see artists sampling great songs from others, and that has been considered a good or a bad move. Recently, the Red Hot Chili Peppers sampled Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers Mary Jane's Last Dance for their funky track, Dani California. Nevertheless, to spin a song of your own, and sample it into another song for an artists own self is considered even more ironic. That is the case for Prince, and his latest single, Fury, the third single from his album 3121. The song samples the opening hook from his 80's track 1999, and takes it into something else. The song actually is good, and delivers a unique feeling of funk, soul & pop. It is a really good track, that still shows that Prince hasn't lost his edge. I found this to be surprisingly upbeat and worth its price. This is a great song, and I hope it gets a lot of good airplay.  Song: "
1,"I special ordered this album after reading a review in Jazziz praising the artist and his work.  One week later I couldn't wait to unwrap it and stuff it into my CD player ...........AWFUL, pure and simple.  As I continue to read flowery reviews I am bewildered.  Weak and reedy voice, poor recording, background instrumentals muffled and distracting. The title Wild Ox Moan about says it all. Honestly, I cannot make it through a single song or through the album at a single sitting"
2,"Yep this is pretty much pop metal for twelve year old girls par excellence. This stuff may not require a lot of musical talent but it certainly requires plenty of stylists for hair - perhaps sitting around in stylists chairs does count as 'suffering for your art'.   But honest injun, I only review albums that I actually own and since I've never ever thrown away a single disc ever bought - well you guessed it - I paid for it and still own it.  The airheaded pop stuff here is truly grating. My list of major problems with this release is;  1 - A band called Danger Danger puts out an album with the lead track of Naughty Naughty. The saving grace is that Naughty Naughty is a darn fine song. Really, the genre doesn't get much better than this. Pity about the rest of this album. 2 - This is the kind of band that Metal Edge magazine pushed to the fore - one of the most horrid segments of the mag was entitled 'The Way the Were' which actually had photos of the band members as kids. Really, pandering to the musical tastes of 12 year old girls is not the way forward. Then again, at the time D/D made a bit of cash so perhaps they're the ones laughing now. 3 - ""Bang Bang - what's that sound / I gave you my heart then you shot me down""    If Naughty Naughty was the genre at it's best then tunes like Bang Bang were the genre at it's most dire.  I have nothing but good memories of this band - they certainly gave us all a good laugh at the time. Despite the fact that in so many ways this only deserves one star, I can't possibly do it. These guys bent over backwards to make themselves seem so nice you wouldn't want to hurt their feelings. Not to mention the fact that Saturday Nite also rocks well. Two great songs and a couple of other good hooks just don't rate so it can't get more than two stars"
5,"Bottom line: a very enjoyable album for ANYONE with an open mind.  Girlfriends, boyfriends, single people, married people, old, young, male, female.  You probably already know (and like) at least 3 songs from this album: ""Every Morning"", ""Someday"", ""Falls Apart"".  So, you're already off to a great start.  And, for those of you old-school Sugar Ray ROCK fans, there's plenty here for you.  Try ""Personal Space Invader"", ""Aim For Me"", ""Glory"", and ""Burning Dog"" if you enjoy cranking it to 11.  Actually, this album is predominantly rock inspired...if you've  listened to the WHOLE THING.  Hip hop fans will find ""Live and Direct"" featuring KRS-One to be a pleasant little surprise.  80's fans will take to their spiced up rendition of Steve  Miller's ""Abracadabra"".  And, they've got some nice softer tunes in the form of ""Ode to the Lonely Hearted"" and ""Even Though"" (a song which seems to have jumped off the time machine from the 50's or something...good stuff).  And, of course there a bits and pieces of that trademark Sugar Ray humor thrown about the album.  Like they always say, Sugar Ray is all about having fun.  Period.  If things like ""image"" matter to you, then steer clear of this band.  If dogmatic adherence to one specific style of music (and ONLY one specific  style of music) excites you then steer clear of this band.  But, if you like having fun with your music (a.k.a. ENJOYING it) and if you can appreciate diverse musical influences, then here ya' go"
5,"This CD has a ""catch"": the surprisingly beautiful voice of Leigh Nash.   I am usually reluctant to hits covers, but in this case I would suggest to give a special try to SNTR performance of The La's ""There She Goes"", Crowded House's superhit ""Don't Dream It's Over"", and even Abba's ""Dancing Queen"". Special mention to that wonderful tune titled ""Kiss Me"". Leigh Nash's voice reinvents these songs and provides a new dimension to the meaning of ""Cover version"".   Believe me... this CD is a serious improvement for your music collection!"
5,"I recently put my vinyl onto a CD, and had a chance to revisit this be-UUU-tiful work.  I agree with another reviewer that ""Sweetheart"" alone is worth the price of admission.  If you like a combination of jazz, blues, pop ... heck, no labels necessary.  In the words of her own song (from another album: ""Label it garbage/Label it art/You can't call it soul/You'll have to call it heart"".  So if you love serious good music, get this album"
4,"I bought this album two years ago, because I'd fallen in love with the one song that made it to radio &quot;In My Hands,&quot; and was hoping the whole album was built like that song.  How wrong I was. At the time I hated it.  I put it away and didn't listen to it again until about a month ago.  While I still think that &quot;Space Ceildh&quot; could stand to go away, I must admit the album grows on you. &quot;Get Me Through December&quot; is a haunting song, as is &quot;Flora MacDonald.&quot;  I like it more and more"
1,I played this CD and was not happy.  I had to return the item becasue it skipped really bad on almost every song
5,"Predating the whole pop-metal explosion of the later 80's by a few years, Def Leppard's 1983 masterpiece ""Pyromania"" still is a shining of how metal sensibilities can successfully merge with pop to create something that has integrity, substance and not an inkling of self parody (which Def Leppard would end up falling prety to themselves in a few short years after this album).  I became a Def Leppard fan with their 1981 album High 'n' Dry but Pyromania took things to an entirely different level.  The songwriting in particular stands as some of the best and catchiest of the 80's (or any decade for that matter).  The band never sounded better and this was the last album for a while that drummer Rick Allen would play an acoustic kit on as he hadn't had his tragic 1984 car wreck yet in which he would lose his left arm.  Singer Joe Elliot's voice was its strongest as well displaying a great range throughoug the wide range of songs on this album.  Guitarist Steve Clark along with Pete Willis (who would be sacked shortly before this album was completed) create a great guitar team.  Peter Collen only contributed some solos to this album as he joined really late in the game, but his solo on the track Stagefright (my favorite DL tune of all time BTW) is amazing in both his note choice & chops in addition to his feel.   Bassist Rick Savage and drummer Rick Allen create a rock solid rhythm section in the vein of AC/DC and add to the proceedings without drawing too much attention to themselves.  Producer Robert ""Mutt"" Lange would contribue to a co-writer on most tracks in addition to adding a very clean and crips sheen to all of the tracks.  This is one of the most well mixed rock/metal albums ever.  To be honest, there's not much more I can say about how great this album is that other countless reviewers have already stated.  This is Def Leppard at the height of their powers/creativity and unfortunately beginning slightly with Hysteria, the world would see the band crumble into self parody and an endless sea of wretched power ballads.  Essential! "
1,"These days, it seems like you hve to try to be a reality star inorder to make it big. For a celebutant like Paris Hilton, she doesn't really deliver as a solid an soulful singer. That is very unfortunately  big shame. Her second single, Nothing In This World, isn't a very good song from a wannabe pop star. The song like Stars Are Blind, is just as bad. I am not very convinced at all. She sounds like she is trying to had to really deliver like Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez and Kelly Clarkson. To actually be honest with you, I'd rather listen to Michael Jackson instead of this. Paris is not aything in this world, and this song is just the shameful same.  Song: F   "
1,"I disagree with all others who reviewed this album. This album is somewhat decent for its time ('94) but overall, the beats are garbage. I think Eiht really stepped up his game when he came out with Death Threatz. The beats on that album are great and I give that album 5 stars"
5,"I can vividly remember when this type of music was ""new""  now it's just very collectable.  Of the steamroller set I loved number 1 and this one.  Help us and save us I had the record albums.  Granted, the cover pctures were more enjoyable back then.  Aside from sentiment it is still lively music. Buy one now"
5,"I first heard this band in the movie 'Desperado'.  I have a couple of their CD's and really enjoy the grooves while driving.  If you're a big top 40 fan, (Britney Spears, etc.) You may not like it.  The songs are not cranked out of the radio play tune machine and have bizzare subject matter.  Keep it up Tito!  P.S. I have tried with poor success to get my friends into this band, but I stand by my taste"
5,i love this cd cassie steele is a great singer and actress i hope see comes out with another album hope y'all love it as much as i d
4,"Being a newer fan to Anti-Flag and only catching their albums (The Terror State and For Blood and Empire) I will admit my ignorance along the lines of their earlier work with what little I know of it.  Something that I have noticed with a large majority of the negative reviews about this album is how they view the political aspects of the album and of the band, as well.  Is this not a cd?  Does the cd not have MUSIC.  How about having a critic on just the music itself like how many of the songs have strong messages and I've been hearing some impressive bass parts along with very catchy songs.  I don't know who Crass is and I don't care.  It's all a matter of opinion and if you don't like the album, that's your deal.  I think it's pretty solid.  Though, I will say this.  Something that I have never liked about Anti-Flag is their music is so limited.  You can only write so many songs about the same topic before it gets old.  Something that I have always appreciated with bands is versatility with writing songs.  So far from what I've heard, it's just all politics... though that is the path that Anti-Flag has chosen to take and they have stuck with it ever since.  So kudos to them"
1,"It never ceases to amaze me how punk bands today consistantly preach against brainwashing when they do exactly what they condemn.  Anti-Flag is nothing more than a gimmick band who got popular riding the ""Down with the establishment"" bandwagon with little real political commentary or discourse.  That being said, I fully believe that bands (and anyone) should have the right to say and think what they want.  After all, this is America, and I am serving in the Army right now to ensure that we have this right.  It just gets to me how they are so willing to step on the very thing which symbolizes that right: The American Flag.  This album is proof yet again that this is what they intend to do.  I have no respect for this traitorus band and would never give them a penny of my hard-earned money.  Besides, wouldn't a real communist refuse to capitalize on their music, anyway"
2,"Definitely not as good as ""Down in Albion"".  THAT record is magic.  This ep is...I dunno...nothing special.  It's missing something.  Mick Jones?  Junk?  Not sure.  I had high expectations from Pete, and this was a bit of a let down"
5,marc bolan is my main man man.  he's just like a lil consuela
4,"Like so many of the albums I now find myself trawling for, my first copy of The Slider was on good old 12"" vinyl. In that original incarnation it only included the first 13 tracks now included on the CD release. ""Thunderwing"" and ""Lady"" were, if memory serves me, first aired on the B-side of the ""Metal Guru"" single, while ""Cadillac"" (the great single-that-never-was in my opinion) never really seemd to find a home it was happy with. In feel it probably belongs with the sparser-sounding ""Zip Gun"" than with the lusher ""Slider"" or ""Tanx"" production. Purists may argue that ""Electric Warrior"" is the T.Rex album to own if you're only going to have the one, but it is essentially a transitional album bridging the gap between the earlier Tolkienesque folk period and the Glam that followed and ends up being neither one thing nor t'other. ""Slider"" lies firmly in the latter period and is as good an example of the strengths and weaknesses of Marc Bolan as writer and performer as you are likely to get. I can think of nobody else in the modern period who has been able to extract such a variety of results from the basic three-chord blues riff. It's a well documented fact that Bolan would have loved to be Elvis, and on the strength of this perhaps he wouldn't have made a bad job of it. It's too easy to treat some of the lyrics harshly, branding them ""pretentious"" or ""unintelligeable"", (although if it were early 20th century poetry it would be called ""hermetic"" and treated with reverence), but that's what Bolan was all about from first to last. T.Rex are probably pretty much of an unknown quantity to most American listeners outside of ""Get It on"" (with it's title inexplicably censored for transatlantic consumption). Here in Britain for 3 or so all too brief years he was the epitome of a pop star. ""Slider"" more than any other album illustrates what he was about before succumbing to McCartney's Syndrome and putting the wife on keyboards"
5,"My friend Marc and I used to take trips to the old coastal bunkers all around the San Francisco Bay Area to map them out.  The first thing we would do when hopping into the car was stick The Slider in the 8 track.  Now admittedly, the lyrics were nonsensical and silly, but the sound was so catchy, that in no time we'd be singing along with them.  The sound was just so unique and riveting, that we'd listen over and over.  Point is, this album will give bring back memories if you grew up in that era, and will give you an idea of what it was really like growing up in the 70's"
5,"Great musicianship and well throughtout lirycs. It's brilliant, original, melodic, fast and vicious. Weel done melodies, incredible solos. Can't go wrong with this one!"
2,"This review has to start with a couple of admissions.  First, I happen to think Cyndi Lauper (especially in her later albums) is an underrated songwriter and performer.  Most people think of her as a pop-culture icon of the 80's and unfortunately dismiss what she's done since then.  Some of her later ballads are sung with great emotion and are among the best-written songs I've ever heard.  On the other hand, I really HATE remixes, especially when they're done solely to try to make ""danceable"" a song that was never intended to be dance music.  So I approached this album with a mix of excitement and fear... excitement that the ""rarities"" would be more of Cyndi's great songwriting and fear that the remixes would suck, as remixes tend to do.  The two rarities on the album are the songs ""The World is Stone"" and ""You Have to Learn to Live Alone"".  There are also extended versions of ""Mother"" and ""What's Going On"".  ""The World is Stone"" talks about how people are turning to stone, ""cold to the touch and hard on the soul"".  The instrumentals are acceptable but nothing special.  Cyndi's vocals convey the emotional message she's sending exceptionally well, and it's a well-written message about there being ""no warmth anymore"" and ""no love anymore"".  While it may be a ""rarity"" it is definitely one of her better and more powerful songs.  ""You Have to Learn to Live Alone"" has a kind of blues or jazz sound to it.  You could imagine it being sung in a smoky nightclub in Casablanca.  Cyndi pulls off the kind of vocals you expect with the music, delivering a powerful and emotional performance in the context of what's a fairly subdued, soft song.  The instrumentals on this song are much better than those for ""The World is Stone"".  The rest of the album consists of remixes, and as I said above, I generally hate remixes.  These are really no exception.  If I had to describe the remixes on this album in a single sentence, that sentence would be: ""How to turn some decent Cyndi Lauper music into something unrecognizable and crappy.""  If you're into the techno-sounding disco stuff, you might enjoy these, I don't know.  Personally, they ruin some decent songs to me.  The only good thing I can find to say about them is that at least they didn't mess with some of her better songs and stuck with the more mainstream stuff like ""Hey Now (Girls Just Wanna Have Fun)""...    If the entire album was like ""The World is Stone"" and ""You Have to Learn to Live Alone"" I would probably give it something in the 8-10 (out of 10) range.  Those two songs are quite good and easily among her best work.  But the 6 remixes on the album pretty much ruin it for me, and I can't in good conscience give the entire album anything better than about a 4.  If it was an album of just the remixes, it would get maybe a 2, and would only rank that high because Cyndi's voice appears in them"
5,This music is totally light-hearted and hugely enjoyable. Track 3 is so cool and track 9 is kind of spooky. I only wish more tracks from the film were in it
1,Maybe I expect too much from an old Wurlitzer but I don't remember the snare drums being so distorted in real life as they are on this CD. Almost like there was some kind of a frequency clipper on the microphone(s) or maybe they were in the wrong place and were overloaded. Whatever the reason I think this CD needs to be remastered (or something) to fix this problem before it can be truly enjoyable. I note also a similar comment about the Volume II CD

1,"I am a fan of Ottmar's work so I did not hesitate when I found a copy of this album for sale. Though not a terrible record it is not what your average Ottmar fan has come to expect. The orchestral arrangements are clumsy or forgettable at best - inappropriate and dischordant at worst. Ottmar's guitar work is mostly relegated to plinking along - sometimes in a slightly dissonant fashion - on top of the orchestral arrangements. None of it is horrible, and a few cuts are even interesting, but my guess is that the typical Ottmat Leibert fan won't be listening to this CD more than once or twice. There are FAR better choices for anyone who likes Ottmar's work. Stick with his more popular stuff and save having to trade this in for somethign else (as I will be doing)"
5,"My gal Sara and I lived on a sailboat in the Caribbean for a long time and we spent most of it at anchor, as we hated marinas. Besides, they were expensive. We're both writers, so on a good day, flat seas, anchored off a deserted island like the Five Island group in Trinidad or Ile Fourche, halfway between St. Martin and St. Barts, where it is pitch black on a cloudy night, but oh so gorgeous when the sky is clear, we'd put these four CDs along with Banana Wind in the CD player's magazine, put the machine on random play, then read and write the day away with Jimmy B playing in the background.  There is just something about listening to Mr. Buffett in the Caribbean, Florida too, that seems so right. His catchy, lyrical, sailing stories, drinking stories, personal stories never get old. They're as fresh the hundredth time as they were the first time. This collection is simply outstanding in every way, not a turkey in the bunch, and oh yes, Mr. B has sung a few turkeys in his day, but as I said, they are not here. These songs will move you to laughter, maybe a tear or two and they may have you up and dancing a bit, but most of all they well waken a sense of adventure in you. Well, they should anyway, unless you're a died in the wool, TV watching, couch potato. But, you know, chances are that even if you do tube the day away, these songs just might get your heart pounding and your soul wanting a bit of adventure. That's a good thing.

2,I was very disappointed in CD.  Way to hillbilly for me
2,"Maire Brennan's singing and artistry is breathtakingly beautiful, and for most this can be rated a fabulous album.  You need to understand, however, that this is a decidedly, in your face, unavoidably christian album.  For those, like me, who are recovering from christianity, it was an unpleasant surprise, but not one for which I will fault or judge Maire Brennan.  I just wish I had realized it before I had bought the album.  It would be better listed or sold under christian music than under any other category"
5,"''Under A Violet Moon'' is a great CD for any Blackmore's Night fan. Lady Candice's voice is eerily haunting, yet comforting as well. Ritchie's miraculous guitar playing is perfectly blended with his wife's voice. A beautiful Masterpiece"
5,"4 tunes,3 live,one studio,all excellent songs,if you don't have surfing with the alien get that cd"
2,Roberts songwriting falls flat . We didn't find the songs as appropriate for children as many other children artists. Roberts songs are very bleak and not children friendly.  Stick with Wiggles or Ralph's World
5,"OK....see if you can make sense of this...my favorite bands are Radiohead, the Cure, Bauhaus, Talking Heads, Kraftwerk, and Dan Fogelberg.....so, where does his sound fit into this genre' of music?  IT DOESNT...i just happen to love this guys voice and his tunes....my favorite one on here is Same Ol Lang Syne...oh my god, i melt when i hear this....i have to admit, lots of his music is sentimental to me due to my childhood, but i  listen to him pretty much every night when i go to bed..i think his music is beautiful......Peace :"
4,"I'm so sick of this ""Alicia Jiles Right"" moron. I can't figure this clown out, she gave Eminem's music 5 stars and said its really good and Eminem is just as if not more offensive to women as Snoop Dogg. You obviously think we're all dumb don't you? Snoop Dogg disrespects woman etc do you think we don't know that? I don't know you but I bet your are pure idiot. Lay off Snoop Dogg and any other rappers your trashing neg reviews on. Keep your f***** opinions to yourself Biotch!  Anyway I miss the old Snoop Doggy Dogg. It seems this guy can't top his debut however if you are a fan of Snoop like me you should purchase this album along with all the others  Doggystyle, Tha Doggfather, Da Game Is To Be Sold Not To Be Told, No Limit Top Dogg, Tha Last Meal, Dead Man Walkin, Tha Eastsidaz, Duces N Trayz THe Old Fashioned Way, R & G The Masterpiece, Welcome to tha chuuch Da album and probably some more I have not mentioned. Like I said it's not as good as some of the others but if you are a true Snoop fan click add to cart now.  "
2,"First of all,Decca engineers insist on to differentiate ""their"" Scholl's voice from that more sweet,resounding previous Harmonia Mundi cd's like Bach Cantatas Solo,English Folksongs and so on where it was a pleasure to hear this singer.Even orchestra Bizantina could be better recorded;maybe Milano Auditorium hasn't fine acoustics.However,the same happens on ""Heroes"" and ""Banquett"".In this Senesino combo just here,Scholl's voice sounds rough and unpleasant,the top of his range excessive and satured.Second of all,in my opinion,opera isn't his confort zone for good.I believe that as a chorister boy,he grew up in that german musical territory singing sacred music by Buxtehude,Bach,where he did his best on recording.In this cd,I heard his worse;a rugged vocalization plentiful in ha-ha-ha,absolutely abusive that seems dreadful to me(""Al lampo dell'armi"" for instance),his vocal colours sounding like croacks sometimes,incongruous and dramatically unfruitful attempt to perform repertoire previously recorded by himself like it was a new,fresh one(""Dove sei"",""Aure,deh,..."").I'm sorry;I know Scholl fans are very zealous on their idol but I have heard much better Senesinos by Derek Lee Ragin,Daniels,Minter,Gall and so on."
5,"I bought their EP CD yesterday, I was going to buy their full album but I didn't have enough money and then I saw the EP CD was cheaper, so I just had to buy it. I liked FlyLeaf before I had their CD because I knew the songs ""I'm so sick"" and ""Fullyalive"" I've seen, the Fully Alive video on Sky Angel (A Christian Channel) before, and the video is awesome! I love all the songs on this cd, my favorite is of course ""Fully Alive"" and ""Red Sam"", and ""I'm so sick"", I love all of the songs though, I can't wait to buy their full CD next time, knowing me I will always love listening to their cd! I LOVE this band, they are better than Evanescence! I HIGHLY recommend that you buy this CD, and the debut CD! I can't wait til their next CD comes out! And Lacey Mosley, does really good in her singing and she can yell in the songs too, she's awesome! FLY LEAF ROCKS"
5,"Playing Time - 39:05 -- Don Rigsby doesn't even turn the big 4-0 until February 28 of 2008. Already he has two decades of professional bluegrass experience with such top groups as Longview, Bluegrass Cardinals, J.D. Crowe & the New South, Lonesome River Band and Rock Country. He's also released four highly-acclaimed solo albums and was twice named SPBGMA's male vocalist for the year. When Rock Country disbanded, Don was faced with two choices - work for someone else, or form his own band. He chose the latter and, unlike previous solo albums from Rigsby (on the Sugar Hill label) that enlisted friends and session players, he has recorded ""Hillbilly Heartache"" with his own group (Midnight Call) that includes himself singing lead and playing mandolin, along with Dale Vanderpool (banjo), Shayne Bartley (guitar), Jesse Wells (fiddle), and Robert Maynard (bass). It was a good move to do it all themselves this time because it's a crackerjack band.   In a few instances, (Make God Laugh, Red Bird, Prisoner on the Highway), their vocal arrangements also call for Rigsby to jump up to tenor on the choruses. ""He Loves To Hear You Shout"" (written by Dixie and Tom T. Hall) is a very nicely presented vocal quartet for the group with Rigsby, Vanderpool, Bartley and Wells doing the vocalizing.   While best known for his mandolin picking, Don's a versatile multi-instrumentalist, and it's a treat to hear him also provide some snippets of guitar, mandele, and fiddle. Two songs (""These Golden Fields"" and ""Any Bar in Birmingham"") incorporate some of Don's light percussion. The former, about farming, features Don's high-lead singing with two harmonies below, as well as Wells' octave violin for a different mood. Obviously, quite a bit of forethought went into producing these songs in the best possible manner for us. In a few, the banjo is muted, and on the closing number, ""I Am The Man, Thomas"") Jesse Wells lays down his fiddle to provide clawhammer banjo as the only accompaniment for Don's voice.   Midnight Call's repertoire is drawn from some excellent songwriters (Shawn Camp, Marty Rabon, Jim Lauderdale, Mark Brinkman, Larry Shell, Kim Williams, Tim Stafford, and others). Bobby Cyrus is a co-writer of ""Big Jim."" I'm curious as to whether Big Jim is a fictional folkloric character or whether there was actually a man who sacrificed himself for others. You may recall that it was Cyrus who penned the reflective ""Carved Our Names in Stone"" that was sung solo by Rigsby on his last solo album, The Midnight Call. Farmers, family, life and love get ample coverage in the songs. For his song of home, he belts out an inspired rendition of Bill Monroe's ""Kentucky Waltz."" Another tale from that region is an intoxicating ""Daddy Was A Moonshine Man."" A standard instrumental, ""Forked Deer"" gallops along, but I hope their future projects introduce us to new tunes. Sung solo, ""Old Green Chevrolet"" relates a tale of a traveling preacher bringing the gospel to mountain folks, and I missed a little harmony on the choruses.   With ""Hillbilly Heartache,"" evocative messages get us thinking, smiling, contemplating, and even laughing when the intoxicating ""Daddy Was A Moonshine Man"" cues up. This Kentuckian clearly has strong mountain roots, and he knows what it takes to produce a very compelling bluegrass album. His reputation and dedication to traditional music, and his innovative vision for the future, are well documented. While he may have stretched boundaries a bit in the past, ""Hillbilly Heartache"" is simply a hallmark album for a superb band to showcase its contemporary bluegrass.

5,When Layne died he didn't get enough respect. He stopped making music for a long time. If he died in 1996 is death would have been more meaningful like Kurt Cobains. Makes you think? Anyway this album is excellent and the last song is called over now. Get it
1,"When I first heard the song inside it got stuck in my head for a long time, and everytime i heard it after that it would get stuck in my head even longer... so i decided to go buy the album.. which was one big mistake.. the vocals are horrid and theres not one good song to get into.. It doesnt even deserve 1 star but i give them one for some how making it to tv..So dont waist your time or money on this band, go for bands like From Zero, Pillar, or Thousand Foot Krutch"
5,"Thanks for reading. I'm surprised reading some reviews that this album receives such poor comments from people. This stuff is brilliant and has awesome songs! As usual the album is a great mix of slower and faster songs. The early line-up was great, albiet missing Don Felder. ( forget about Walsh ) What's remarkable for me is not the hit songs "" Take it Easy"" ""Witchy women"" and "" Peaceful Easy Feeling "" ( which are all wonderful songs ) it's the OTHER songs. Some are just brilliant, including "" Chug all night"" ""Tryin"" and the best non single ever from the Eagles "" Take the Devil"" Mind blowing song from Randy Miesner. Great guitar and melodies as usual. This is my second favourite Eagles album, just pipped by "" One of these nights""  A must for music fans in general. This is GREAT MUSIC!!!  Essential for your collectio"
5,"Loretta Lynn rocks.  Awesome cd.  ""Portland Oregon"" is one of the best songs I have heard in a long, long, time.  No one says ""Oregon"" like Loretta.  Rock on, Loretta"
1,"I'm a huge Dylan fan---own everything he ever released.  In my humble opinion, this is Bob's worst.  Just a really bad CD.  'Nuff said"
5,"I never listened to Celine Dion's music much. I happened to check this album out from the library and had to go out and buy it after it was returned. This album has just the right mix of sad, slow love songs and up-beat ones. I would buy all of her CD's simply based on this one"
5,"The soundtrack of this movie was undoubtedly instrumental in making Empire of the Sun the amazingly beautiful movie that it is.  With the first track alone, SUO GAN, which is actually a Welsh lullaby and not a Japanese song, you'll find yourself riveted and drawn to the time and place and story of Jim. The beauty of listening to this soundtrack is sitting back, and reliving the scenes from the movie in your head.  It is timeless, bittersweet and triumphant all in one"
5,"Was reborn when I heard this. I used to be a heavy metal rocker in my teens, but hearing it now is a whole 'nuther experience. You cant fault the raw energy of this band, they smoke! It's balls out, no nonsense, bread n butter rock music, no gimmicks. Check out the Movie (Let there Be Rock) and see the experience! Angus's striptease is hysterical and consolidates his place as one of Rock's true characters. He is essentially Chuck berry on Speed! Bon was a true gravelly dude. My mum used to work at a Salon called Scissors in the 70's and her college 'Silver' used to date Bon, so she got to meet the boys a few times. When she cut Angus's hair, he apparently said nothing and drank 4 pints of milk during the process. A real school boy to the end. I love this band and I love Bon's smutty lyricism, too. R.I.P"
1,"Well, it has been more than two years now, and Perfect Pop Album is (somehow) back after it's very minor success with the first edition, and it seems that this new edition is going to do even worse.  First problem, Hollywood Records shouldn't be doing complications. They are Disney Records's sister. I mean, look at the tracklistings. They look like another Radio Disney Jams CD. Joss Stone, Josh Kelly, and Liz Phair are really the only reason buying ""Got Hits 2"". The rest are Disney Channel fillers.  The CD starts with seven Disney acts in a row, starting with Hilary Duff, the lastest flop in the music industry. Depsite the fact she had multi-platinum success with ""Metamorphisis"", she didn't even go Gold on her self-titled second album. ""Come Clean"" was really the only big hit by this artist, which to me was a big shocker, ""So Yesterday"" was way better. Then we move to Jesse McCartney, OH BOY! ""Beautiful Soul"" may have a good melody, but Jesse's vocals, awful. And the lyrics make no sense. ""I don't want another pretty face, I don't want just anyone to hold, I don't want my love to go to waste, I want you and your beautiful soul."" Well, if you think about it, isn't that a beautiful soul? A girl with a pretty face, and good personality? Whatever. Let's move on to JoJo. Okay, I don't mind her, as long as you put something decent by her, like ""Leave (Get Out)"". Instead, they put her hit ""Baby It's You"". The song did well on the charts, and the song is decent, but I think I've had enough. But wait, there's four more! Lindsay Lohan is next up, she didn't have many hit songs, unless you coun't her minor ""Rumors"" big. They put on ""Ultimate"". WTF? When and where was that a hit? Or maybe I should look on foriegn charts to see why Hollywood Records chose this. It was on the 2003 soundtrack ""Freaky Friday"", and all of the sudden it's big. Moving on. Next up is Bow Wow's rival, Romeo. Okay, for all honesty here, how DID he get a record deal? Master P's song ""Make Em Say Ugh"" wasn't bad enough? ""My Cinderella"" is just a poor quality rap song you'd hear on Radio Disney. Then we have Skye Sweetnam. Now, ""Tangled Up In Me"" is actually a decent song. It's melody is damn catchy, and they have pretty good voices. I definitely wouldn't recommended their ""Noise From The Basement"" album. Way too much filler. Then we have unknown Jump 5. Okay, don't name the album Got Hits if you have an unknown artist. Anyway, ""God Bless The U.S.A."" is horrible, they can't sng their way out of a bag. Then we're FINALLY up with Disney artists (but their revenge comes again later in the CD).  Next, we have a country song by Rascal Flatts. It's okay; not a country fan. The album is called ""Got Hits 2: More Perfect POP"". Notice the uppercase letters. Then, we have our first song worth listening to, from Joss Stone. Though, ""Some Kind Of Wonderful"" was barely a hit, it's still an awesome add, as the song is decent. She has a great voice and her songs are great; jazz flavored pop songs.   Then we have Raven-Symone and the Cheetah Girls. I'm not even continuing with this song, since those artists alone should spell trouble.  Luckily, after that, we have alternative rock queen Liz Phair, with her self lyriced ""Extraordinary"". The song is excellent, from the jammin' guitars to the extraordinary lyrics, to her voice. You should definitely check out her music, especially her older stuff.  Two paragraphs back, I said that Disney's revenge is coming. Well, the Disney Radio artists have returned. We have Raven Symone (second time on this CD) doing ""Supernatural"", which was probably the biggest hit in Disney Radio history, and is featured on ""The Haunted Mansion"" soundtrack. On regular Top 40 radio, never heard it. The song is average at best, and the same rule applies. Just because you have a big TV show, does not mean your vocals are automatically good and you can make a record. And the same rule applies with the next artist. Once again, the second song on this CD by Hilary Duff, and she brings her sister into the song, which is the third Disney Soundtrack song. This one was featured on the ""A Cinderella Story"" soundtrack. Okay, this remake is just horrific. First, you have the second worst vocals in the history of music (Milli Vanilli being the worst), then you have ""Our Lips Are Sealed"". Now, the Go-Gos version is very good, but the lyrics don't even fit Hilary. Next, we have the Vengaboys. Enough said. Then we have some group called Mr. C and the Slide Man. Maybe I'm not quite old enough, but who the F is this? The song is ridiculous, and definitely should not end up on a 2004-2005 hits album. Then, Josh Kelley's ""Amazing"" is amazing, and he actually writes his music. That gave me some hope about the end of this album...but wait...we're at the end.                 Unless you're a gigantic fan of Radio Disney and like 2003 songs on a 2005 complication, avoid this on all costs, and get Now 19 in stores Tuesday July 19, 2005.  Replay Value: Low Child Appeal: High Teen Appeal: Low Adult Appeal: Lo"
5,"I typically don't listen to C&W; I'm more of a fan of the groups 'Disturbed', 'Staind', 'Metallica', etc., but I have to say that this is some of the best country and western I've heard to date.  After listening to the title track 'When It All Goes South', I went out and bought the CD.  It's laid back, upbeat, and thoroughly enjoyable to listen to"
2,"I was, overall, disappointed by this CD.  There are many good reviews here, but they generally overpraise.  Tracks 4 through 8 have too much synthesizer for my ears.  A major highlight is track 9, The Crab and the Egret, but interestingly, the flute is accompaniment to the wondrous Chinese percussion.  Disappointingly, the CD is only 40 minutes long and left me wanting more tunes without synthesizer accompaniment"
4,"This is an awesome band, and they've realeased an awesome CD. So it's not the most technical stuff. It has atmospehere. But ok, let's bash a band because their music has higher meaning than just cool sounds and constant head bangning. While there are some headbanging tracks on here, a lot of it is about the atmosphere. Somehow this music can sound very depressing but with in the same song gives you a sense of hope. It's a very different sound. Probably an aquired sound"
5,"Soft Machines's ""Fifth"" (also known as ""5"") finally get the 24-bit remastering(from original tapes)that it deserves!!! Awesome full-detailed sound!!! Great booklet with photos and liner notes too!!! A jazz rock classic!!! Great playing from Hugh Hopper,Mike Ratledge,the late Elton Dean,Phil Howard,John Marshall,and Roy Babington!!! There's even a rare alternate take of ""All White"" included as a bonus track!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A"
5,"Pimp C and Bun B came out in 1994 with an album with nothin but fire.  This album slams from start to finish with that old school down south feel.  The beats are melodic G-Funk, with twangy guitar and smokin keyborad riffs.  Lyrically and vocally, UGK kills in all departments.  They really know how to tear up the mic with their firey flows. The track ""Feds in Town"" is a gangster classic with a phat, funky beat and tight scratches. ""Super Tight..."" is the perfect one to pop in the six fo while hittin switches down the avenue. The mid 90's was one of the best periods in rap history, and this album is testament to it.  Don't sleep on this classic"
5,"Scarface has definately captured the love of the street in this here album.  He straight up kept it real with all the homeboys in todays' rap biz.  With tracks like ""Do what the .... you want to do"" All the Homies in the street like me be flockin' to the record store for the fact that be the motto.  There is a lot of bad mouthin' goin' on in these reviews, but them folks need to check nuts and realize what has been done here.  Scarface dedicates this to Homies in the street, that's real. So much respect goes to the Big Homie Scarface for givin' it up to the street"
5,This is an inspirational CD as well as an indicator of Mariah's great talent.  I enjoy hearing her voice proceed up and down the scale and I love the Gospel flavor on some of her songs
5,Belinda Carlisle is such a smooth and pleasant singer.  It is so nice to listen to hear.  This is a nice set of great hits
1,it sucks and the album cover is pretty boring to
1,"The lead singer's song delivery is quite mopey. The keyboard solos are rather pedestrian, but was way ahead of it's time, it's match for match with ""free jazz"" and japanese noise. The guitarist is quite talented and to be honest, the rest of the band weighs down his true potential. The song ""Riders in the Storm"" is a good Exhibit A on why a band should not record whilst taking barbituates"
1,"bwahaaaaaahaaaaahahahahahahahahahahahha NO SERIOUSLY im not finished HOLDING MY SIDES YET BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  oh man to actually think their are kids out there who consider this music.  I know im going to quit my job and paint my face with clown make up and change my name to weakho The @$$ clown (hey it wouldnt be any more ridiculous than any of these other lame retards names. colton grundy???)  and I should have millions by the end of the year from all the fuggaloes who are obviously smokin punds of weed out of a pipe to be diggin this junk. Canibus or asheru could rip these weak retards inside of one verse minus 500,000,000,000,000  stars. peace to all the real Hip hoppers out ther"
5,"This CD is true poetry, full of metaphor and metonymy. I have never become tired of listening to this poetry, the evocative moods and desolate yet soulful landscapes of loneliness. The pieces are timeless quality, and its musicality provides a backdrop for the lyrics rather than being intrusive. Truly a remarkable work of art"
4,"It ain't easy being an interpreter.  Christopher O'Riley's an accomplished classical pianist, but his biggest claims to fame are three piano interpretations of modern musicians--two discs worth or re-imagined Radiohead, and now this excellent exploration of Elliott Smith.   Most respectable classical musicians don't do this sort of thing--they usually stick to what are deemed respectable composers. And the ones who do bother with anything composed after, say, 1925 and played on anything other than orchestra instruments? They become a little trashy by association, exuding a faint odor of music whoredom as they ride the rock n' roll gravy train from the New Release section to the Bargain Bin. (This happens whether they're re-interpreting the Rolling Stones or Pink Floyd or, heaven help us, Metallica.) Heck, most musicians in general are fearful of doing too much of someone else's work, lest they be seen as bar-band ready tribute acts rather than as the sainted singer-songwriters they'd like to be.   Thank heavens O'Riley's not like most musicians. He seems to see interpretation as something like what it used to be in the Frank Sinatra heydey--something anyone can and should do as much as they want to, provided they're patient enough to really take their time about it and bold enough to make someone else's songs their own. For that's the true test of a musician--not whether or not they cover other people's work, but whether they put in the effort to give their audience something more than a tracing-paper copy of a song's original outlines.  By that standard, O'Riley's latest outing's a smashing success. It is a demanding listen--don't just pop in while riding the subway to work. I'm thinking headphones at home, late night, no distractions, just you and Chris and Chris's piano and Elliott's ghost.  On his previous outings, O'Riley had an easier task--on most Radiohead songs, lyrics and musical tone match pretty well. (Paranoid songs sound paranoid. Unhappy songs sound unhappy. And...well, that just about covers it, actually. Not that I'm complaining, Thom.) But what made Elliott special, among other things, was the way he so frequently married bleak lyrics about depression and addiction and self-loathing to poppy little tunes as radio-friendly as anything this side of the early 60s Beatles.  So O'Riley's opted here for re-imaginings that somehow capture the trajectory of the original songs while giving them the melancholy feel of Elliot's tragic lyrics and aching voice. (Check out ""I Didn't Understand"" or ""Speed Trials"" or especially the sad scared rumble of ""Independence Day"" if you want to know what I'm talking about.) As usual, O'Riley goes above and beyond the call of duty in scouring the back catalog for songs to play. (If you're like me, that means you might miss ""Pitselah"" but feel comforted that someone out there's a much more devoted and appreciative Elliott Smith fan than you'll ever be.)  It's a shame this sort of thing doesn't happen more often. Then again, there aren't too many modern musicians respectable enough to deserve the O'Riley treatment"
5,"Rippington's during the period Moonlighting was made were the epitomy of Jazz fusion with latino flair. Fusion today is milk toast compared to this CD. ""Soft Jazz""  has become the term for bands and artists of this genre, and it fits. All radio friendly and crossover hopeful. This CD smokes with vibes, fast guitar, syncapated rythyms, and memorable melodies. Toe tapping and should be played twice in a row to let it sink in. Russ Freeman is the most under-rated jazz guitarist of his time. He is never mentioned with Carlton, Rit, Lorber, Dimeola,etc..... He is a great songwriter and his music appeals to all that listen, old and young alike....."
5,"I think I'm following in love with JONI MITCHELL ... all over again after listening to this cd. For some Boomers there will always be songs from our youth that, when heard later in life, will immediately whissssssssk us back there in our minds. This Joni gem has plenty of those type songs. XOXOXO, Joni"
5,"This album has it all. Utterly gorgeous. Bittersweet Symphony serves as a classic opener, complete with luscious strings. A perfect video clip to match too. Don't try walking down a busy city street while listening to the song. You'll start trying to imitate Ashcroft's negligent and arrogant swagger.  While Sonnet is sweet, The Rolling People and Come On are epic, angry, arrogant songs that just make you wanna sing out loud and just go off. It's an adrenalin rush in your ears....  Lyrcially, the songs are deep. Ashcroft is a fascinating lyricist, and his sentiments in Weeping Willow and The Rolling People are endlessly intriguing.  70 minutes long, but it's a soaring sensation. Every song has merit, even Neon Wilderness that is pivotal to maintaing the perfect flow of the album.  A must have for any one who likes British rock. One of the most important albums of the 90's.."
1,I was lucky to have not wasted any buck on it.Thanks for the lovely service!the sample of 1 minute aimless lousing on note leaded me to an immediate decision
4,"After listening to this CD a couple times, I will be keeping it on my iPod playlist for some time. It will come in quite handy when I want to drown out the voices of people with ""single phase"" minds! Yes, it is supposed to be relaxing! Comparing this to Muzak is nothing short of ignorant! On a better note, I would tend to agree that Peter White is creative when it comes to mixing up his sound with other artists. Yet another reason to really appreciate the jazz community. If you are a Peter White fan, you will not be let down."
5,"Supertramp's seventh album entitled Paris was released in October of 1980.  The album was recorded in November of 1979 in Paris, France at the Pavillion on the final night of the band's Breakfast in America European tour. Paris is a wonderful live set, capturing the band at the peak of their popularity when co-leader/guitarist/vocalist/keyboardist Roger Hodgson was still with the group. When you consider that the possibility of Hodgson returning to Supertramp these days very doubtful, Paris becomes a more important live document of the band, indeed.  Many great Supertramp classics are included in this live two disc set, such as most of 1974's grand breakthrough Crime of the Century(the spirited opener School, Bloody Well Right, Hide in Your Shell, Asylum, Dreamer, Rudy and the closing Crime of the Century which closes this live album), three songs from 1975's highly underrated followup Crisis? What Crisis? (Ain't Nobody But Me, A Soapbox Opera and Two of Us), two from 1977's Gold selling US breakthrough Even in the Quietest Moments(From Now On and Fool's Overture), and three from the #1 Multi-Platinum selling Breakfast in America(the monster hit The Logical Song, the title cut and the Top 20 smash Take The Long Way Home) plus one exclusive song called You Started Laughing which was not found anywhere else save the B-side to a song called Lady from Crisis? What Crisis?.  Hodgson and co-leader/keyboardist/vocalist Rick Davies sing their hearts out and play their respective keyboards with great passion, and Hodgson also serves up some incredible fretwork on the guitar. Co-horts John Helliwell on saxophones/clarinets/occasional keyboards, additional backing vocals and band MC(he does the stage bantering here, especially his humorous intro to Breakfast in America), drummer Bob C. Benberg and bass player Dougie Thomson have terrific interplay with Hodgson and Davies, helping to bring the band's great melodic music to life in tremendous fashion.  Just like on their studio albums, the band totally cook live in concert, too. The songs on here rival their studio counterparts, especially on Rudy which is played at a faster speed than the studio version on the Roger/Rick vocal duel section.  Paris did well peaking at #8 on the album charts(going Gold right away) and is one of my Top 10 favorite live rock albums ever, especially with the remastering on this album.  Highly recommended!"
5,"The album, ""In Rock"", by Deep Purple, was a milestone in early progressive rock history; a gem showcasing British hard rock at its best and an example of this particular genre that was strongly influenced by classical music.  It was the first studio album by a new line-up of the band that attained great success commercially, producing four(4) solid studio albums while touring the world almost nonstop.  The new members of the band were Ian Gillan on vocals and Roger Glover on bass, and what a difference their addition made to the sound of the band.  Just take a listen to the song, ""Child In Time"", a timeless masterpiece of more than ten minutes in length.  Just prior to releasing the album, ""In Rock"", the first studio album for this renown line-up of the band, Deep Purple recorded a unique presentation of their work with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra.  The work was performed (and recorded for later album release) in September of 1969.  Entitled, ""Concerto for Group and Orchestra"", the work reflected the band's strong initial ties to classical music, and it was a wonderful foretaste of things to come.  It certainly drew attention to the band.  With the presentation of its first work together as a band at a prestigious venue, namely, The Royal Albert Hall in London, Deep Purple began to forge something new and worthwhile in progressive rock, a path that blended the unique talents of its members, all of whom were accomplished musicians.  Specifically, the band's music was highlighted, and driven, by organist Jon Lord; by the guitar of a true guitar virtuoso in Richie Blackmore; and now, by the strong vocals of a new member of the band, Ian Gillan, who oftentimes wailed and screamed to complement effectively the sheer volume of the music that his bandmates produced.  After all, these were the wonderful beginnings of hard rock in all of its glory!  Nevertheless, and astonishingly as it may seem, the band was not alone on this particular path in rock music history.  Other bands were likewise breaking new ground in 1969 in the progressive rock music field just ahead of the release of Deep Purple's album, ""In Rock.""  The Moody Blues were already well-established; King Crimson's initial line-up of that year would become a short-lived new-comer; and Yes, having had just released its second album, was still going through personnel changes.  Led Zeppelin, although not a part of the progressive rock music scene, was nevertheless establishing its name in hard rock in 1969, but the band was coming from a different direction musically, drawing its inspiration from the blues.      Another prominent band at that time in the progressive rock music field, The Moody Blues, also had an opportunity to record their music with an orchestra, specifically, The London Festival Orchestra.  The renown line-up of the band with Justin Hayward and John Lodge recorded their initial album, ""Days of Future Past"", with the aforementioned orchestra in 1967.  However, the band decided to play all of the instruments themselves for their second effort, namely, the album, ""In Search of a Lost Chord.""  Here, The Moody Blues played thirty-three different instruments, including the mellotron.  This relatively new instrument duplicated, to some degree, the wonderful sounds of an entire philharmonic orchestra.  Taking the mellotron into the studio, and afterwards, on the road, on the concert circuit, meant that the band was able to trailblaze, at its own pace, free from being dependent upon a philharmonic orchestra, its unique sound in progressive rock music.  As a result, by 1969, The Moody Blues had already established themselves as innovative musicians in the progressive rock music field and more, with the release of each new album, The Moody Blues continued to broaden their horizons musically and add to their ever-growing fan base.  Unsurprisingly, The Moody Blues broke new ground in 1969 with the release of two phenomenal albums, namely, ""On The Threshhold of a Dream"" and ""To Our Children's Children.""  Both of these albums are worth a listen.  Significantly, the popularity of these two albums marked a broadening acceptance in 1969 of progressive rock music, and in regards to The Moody Blues, the mellotron became an integral part of their music.  Nonetheless, the stage was set for the following year when the well-known line-up of The Moody Blues would release their fifth album, ""A Question of Balance"", continuing their strong ties with classical music, and Deep Purple would release their gem, ""In Rock.""  It is important to note here that Deep Purple followed a slightly different path from the one taken by The Moody Blues.  While The Moody Blues preferred softer sounds and vocals that produced memorable ballads and love songs, and at times, the band even added passages of read poetry on their albums, Deep Purple followed the direction of ever-louder music, levels that prompted its singer, Ian Gillan, at times, to wail and scream!  While Deep Purple headed towards the branch of progressive rock music that would eventually be labeled as ""hard rock"", The Moody Blues embraced an entirely different vision.  The band set the controls for their somewhat mystical journey pointed towards the heavens.  On this preset course, The Moody Blues, that is, their music and their lyrics, actually became, at times, heaven-bound, especially when their music was surrounded by, enriched with, and propelled by, the outworldly sounds of the mellotron.  King Crimson was another band that, at that time, was forging new paths in progressive rock music.  King Crimson made its public debut in the summer of 1969 at a free concert in London's Hyde Park with the Rolling Stones, and soon thereafter, the band released its five-song masterpiece, ""In the Court of the Crimson King.""  The album quickly became a true phenomenon, influencing many musicians at that time.  Like The Moody Blues, King Crimson used the mellotron; like Deep Purple, the band had a true guitar virtuoso in Robert Fripp; and like the individual members of The Moody Blues, King Crimson employed the services of a multi-instrumentalist in Ian McDonald.  Like The Moody Blues and Deep Purple, King Crimson was strongly influenced by classical music, but the band's music also reflected its ties to jazz and folk music.  Like The Moody Blues, King Crimson placed considerable weight on the lyrics of its songs, employing the noted lyricist, Peter Sinfield.  However, this initial (and stellar) line-up of the band was to become short-lived, and as a result, it unfortunately only created this one well-received album.  During this period of time, another band was likewise beginning its journey on a path that, with the passage of time, would prove to be extraordinarily successful.  The band was Led Zeppelin.  Like Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin's music was oftentimes loud, hence the label, ""hard rock"", but unlike Deep Purple and other progressive rock bands at that time, Led Zeppelin's music was based on the blues and, to some extent, on British folk music.  As a result, Led Zeppelin followed a slightly different path within the hard rock genre than Deep Purple, but its music had such an ever-growing appeal that its popularity influenced many bands both, established and those bands that were just starting out.  Like Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin had a true guitar virtuoso in Jimmy Page who, in the early years of the band, played his electric guitar with a violin bow as a novelty and also to produce special effects.  Much like the supergroup, Cream, that preceded them, Led Zeppelin continued to electrify the blues and while the band was reformulating this process, it began to establish its own style, a style that, along with the band, Black Sabbath, and several other bands at that time, began to mold yet another branch of rock called, ""heavy metal.""  Led Zeppelin released its initial album, ""Led Zeppelin"", in January of 1969, and its second album, ""Led Zeppelin II"", later in the year.  Both of these albums profoundly changed the rock music landscape forever that year"
2,I listen to this cd because billie is my moms favorite singer and she heard this is one of her best boy were they wrong. Her voice is so bad becasue of all the drugs she has done and music is way overproduce. Billie was at her best with a more strip down sound with just a couple of musicans not a few blowed orcherstra. Fans like this because it is billie and if she sang the phone book they would by it and the fact that her life was just as bad as the songs that she sang. You make love a artist a whole lot but you got to admit when they have done something that is far from there best that does not mean that you should love them anyless. The one good thing about billie is that there is alot of her music to chosse from before you buy this
4,"I will cry at anything it seems, My Girl & Armageddon floor me everytime, and I sometimes even cry at Neighbours. So I just knew by reading the blurb of this, that I would cry.  It's amazing these days that a friendship can span three decades - so far my longest friendship has lasted nearly 10 years. And we've been through a lot, but never had a serious argument. As the old saying goes, guys, jobs, etc come & go, but friendships last forever.  In this, the friendship starts at the age of roughly 11, and the young actresses who play Barbara Hershey & Bette Midler's characters are excellent. The little actress who plays CeCe Bloom at 11 is the spitting image of Bette Midler - poor child! She's got the hair, the wide smile and the mannerisms down pat, and it's so funny to watch her. It's a shame Mayim Bialik hasn't done much else, it's mainly voice work she does now (most notably she voices a character in Extreme Ghostbusters.) They become penpals, and the relationship is played out through letters, until they finally get together. The film spirals from there, from husbands, to divorces, to arguments, to children.  It's predictable, and I did find Bette Midler's character just a little irritating, but that wasn't due to Bette Midler. It was just the way she played the character she annoyed me, she was so self centered. Barbara Hershey's character was fun, kinda the sidekick to CeCe, and Barbara actually got collagen injections in her lips to look younger, as she was playing her character through such a long period.  Of course you know Barbara's character is gonna get ill, but it's the way it's done, it's very subtle to start with, she starts looking more tired, and then it snowballs, and it's shocking how they manage to make her look so awful, she deteriorates really quickly, and I have to say the makeup artists did an excellent job there.  The funniest line in this film is my title for this review. ""Over the shoulder boulder holders"" is the perfect way to describe those annoying things called bras.  I've heard ""Wind Beneath My Wings"" many times before, and it's an extremely powerful song. What made a bigger difference was watching what was happening on screen, and listening to the lyrics, it brought a whole new meaning to the song, a meaning that I never got before. Well, that was me. Thankfully, I was watching this alone at the time, cos it would have been really embarrassing for someone to see me crying the way I did. To say Beaches had an effect on me is the understatement of the year. Even after I'd switched it off, I was still going about the house in tears. I'll never hear ""Wind Beneath My Wings"" the same again.  Unfortunately, I bought the bog standard, no frills, DVD, not realising that there was a special edition. But I'm quite happy with the edition I have. I'd probably cry through the extras too.  I'll probably watch this again (I still force myself to watch Armageddon & My Girl now & again, just because I love them that much), and I'll probably cry even more now I know what's coming. It's a terrific film, and is definitely the ultimate chick flick. It's also directed by Garry Marshall, so watch out for a cameo by Hector Elizondo"
2,"Oh my goodness this is one the best CD's I've bought.  Finally a CD you can share with the one you love (I mean really love). This is not for boyfriend and girlfriend love cute-sy stuff...this is for serious lovers til the end, no matter what. I ain't there yet with anybody, but boy does this CD excite me to know I will feel like that one day. To think it was only $4!!! I would've paid had I known how excellent it was. Kenny and Chante celebrate love and so do I!!! GET this CD now!! and dance, laugh, kiss and ""stuff"" with your loved one!"
4,"This release includes all ten of the brothers' top 40 hits from 1971 to 1974 (""One Bad Apple"" through ""Love Me For a Reason"" and ""The Proud One"") plus two additional cuts: ""I Can't Stop"" and their version of ""He Ain't Heavy."" The 1992 greatest hits compilation on the Curb label is essentially the same disc minus the two additional tracks. ""I Can't Stop"" was recorded in the late sixties back when the brothers were regularly on television on Andy Williams' weekly variety show. The song was released after ""One Bad Apple"" topped the national charts. The flip side of that number one hit was their remake of the Hollies' hit ""He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother."" That tune was eventually covered over the next few years by many artists, including Neil Diamond and Olivia Newton-John. If you don't already own the 1992 hits disc or the three disc box set released in 2000 (also on the Curb label) then this is the compilation for you. You may also want to get your hands on the other two recently released ""20th Century Masters"" collections: one covers Donny's solo hits of the 70s plus the other disc features his hit duets with sister Marie from the same decade"
1,"This cd is maaad weak.  The beats are wack, the lyrics are wack and C.B. is just swinging on Eightball and MJG'S fame to get his cd out.  By this time this is an oldie but it is as bad today as the day it was released.  I  would sell mine if I could find anyone to take it"
5,"Greggs first Solo Album. Cut in Capricorn Studios with a 19 year old Chuck Leavell on Keys is a superb LP. Re workings of ""Midnight Rider"" and ""Please Call Home"" are instant classics as is ""Multi Coloured Lady"" and Greggs gospel arrangement of ""Will the Circle be Unbroken"". If you love your music Heartfelt and Blues/Roots soaked then this is a must have.."
5,"This was the most sophisticated popular music that I heard when I was young.  Joshua Rifkin, who also plays piano rags by Scott Joplin on another record, arranged and conducted this music.  ""Both Sides Now"" (win and lose are a strange trip in this song) was a hit on the radio for years, competing with ""Walk Away Renee"" and ""Pretty Ballerina"" by The Left Banke for best songs with harpsichord in popular music.  I soon bought THE JUDY COLLINS SONGBOOK with 55 songs that included eight of the songs on ""Wildflower.""  The first musical thing I notice about these songs now is how often I hear a trill or slower alternation between two notes.  The first song, ""Michael from Mountains"" by Joni Mitchell is in the key of E-flat, with a short introduction that repeats F G F G F G in the treble clef before Judy Collins starts singing those notes.  The second song, ""Since You've Asked"" by Judy Collins, which seems to be in E-minor, starts with an E and D alternating an octave higher over an E-minor7th chord, dropping through B-minor to a C chord with E D E D E D E in the octave of the voice being much like the introduction to ""Michael ..."" but with enough G, A sus.4, D9, A-minor7th, and B chords to have as much complexity as sophisticated people expect to hear in their music.  The words on such simple lines, ""Take the lilies and the lace from the days of childhood, All the willow winding paths leading up and outward, This is what I give . . . "" are as poetic as can be expected when people hardly listen.  ""Sisters of Mercy"" by Leonard Cohen is brilliantly done with flutes and French horns.  There is certainly more going on than I can describe.  Judy Collins had done ""Suzanne"" on an earlier album, ""In My Life,"" and the combination of Judy singing Leonard Cohen songs worked so miraculously that ""Wildflowers"" took it in a very religious direction.  ""Priests"" has 7 verses, with the third verse:  And who will shoot the arrow That men will follow through your grace. And when I'm Lord of memories And all your armor has turned to lace.  The music seems a lot more complicated than a trill, possibly in B-flat-minor, with the notes between the staffs alternating between B-flat and A-flat three times per measure until the chord changes to C-flat.  If you have never heard ""La Chanson des Vieux Amants"" by Jacques Brel and Gerard Jouannest, you might not realize how sophisticated French popular songs had been before this album pushed American radio up to international standards.  Big bands had been popular once in the United States, and American music during World War II might have been as popular as anything the rest of the world had to offer, but I lost track of what songs great singers had to choose from after that, when Perry Como and Dean Martin could have used a few more hits.  There are some distinct instrumental voices which make the Brel song on ""Wildflowers"" interesting, but Brel often worked with Gerard Jouannest to achieve musical complexity.  So I suspect that this version is notable because Judy Collins' French is so beautiful.  The final song in her songbook, ""My Father,"" (on the ""Who Knows Where the Time Goes"" album) is about ""My father always promised us that we would live in France,"" and she sings like she wants that more than anything else in the world.  Contemplating intense desire is inspiring, but this song for lovers who have grown old expresses it sweetly.  ""Oh, mon amour, Mon doux, mon tendre, mon verveilleux amour, ...""  ""Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye"" is a beautiful song by Leonard Cohen, soft with sorrow but Hey . . "
2,"Keller Williams is a fine FINE acoustic guitar player.  I can't deny him that.  However, after seeing him live, I can't say I will ever see him again.  Too much looping, too much cheese and not enough grit.  Light and fluffy.  Maybe you could call it bubble gum music.   I'm not turned off to the jamband scene.  That's not it at all.  I was a Phish fan for many years...going back to the late eighties.  I really enjoy improvisation.  My musical life revolves around it, whether I'm playing or listening, whether its jazz, free or jamming.  I love it all.  I just find Keller Williams and a lot of the bands (not that he's a band really) that are in the ""jam"" scene to be pretty boring.  At least Keller doesn't go on twenty minute quasi-bluegrass noodle jams"
5,"All children, especially American children, should be introduced to the first two Boston albums at an early age.  They are among the best guitar oriented rock records ever in the history of humankind.  Fantastic guitar arrangements and tone, and otherwordly vocals performances by Brad Delp all captured here for our enjoyment in perpetuity.  You owe Tom Scholtz more money, and you know it"
1,"Okay, I too fell for this.....I was under the impression that this CD contained PRINCE music tracks.....NOT just a spoken word, unauthorized audio biography!!  Amazon's description should have made this clear, and I would not have purchased this item. "
5,"I loved the movie, so I bought the CD to go with it.  This is the best version of Chicago ever.  Everyone can really sing and sing well.  I love Catherine Zeta-Jones!  She's fantastic!  Renee did well too, I was surprised by talent.  Richard Gere too amazed me with his talent.  John C. Reilly is absolutely AMAZING doing Mister Cellophane.  Queen Latifah was great as well.  If you're not sure which Chicago soundtrack to buy, I would suggest this one over the Broadway ones, unless you want all the songs.  They cut a few songs out of the movie, but it was no major loss.  This is a great soundtrack and highly recommend it to anyone!"
5,"Gang Starr really put out some classic ish here. This is one of those albums that you may dismay as being sub-par, or even bad first listen if you arn't into underground, but you soon relize how this album is a gem. DJ Premeir, and Guru have been putting out classic material sence the late 80's, with there first full album ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"".  Premo is widely regaurded as one of the finest producers to ever grace the boards in hip hop history, and his partner in crime Guru is known as The King Of monotone Rap.  This is artistically a incredible peice of work. Guru & Premo put out a style of Rap that wasnt commen in the 90's, and is non-existant now! A Minimalistic Producer known for playing a melody of three keys, and a obsession for scratching teaming up with a monotone  soft spoken slow tempo rapper. Sound like a weird combonation right? Wrong... If Being a Hip Hop duo was a marrige Gang Starr would have been couple of the year for 10 years straight. This is the type of album you have to spend some time listening to, sure I have my favorite songs of the batch, but they are all solid, and the way Premo mixed together the songs, and even transitions is strokes of genius. Sure you can listen to ""Im the man"" 5 times, but you will get the full effect of ""Im The Man"" in the way Gang Starr men't for you to hear it if you listen to the tracks leading to it.  Everything seems timed perfectly. Strong in your face, phony rapper, and conspiracy theorys come in at the proper time for a full listen thru. The Interludes are also excellently timed. After hearing ""Im The Man"" you want something a little chill, & relax, so Premo follows it up with ""92 Interlude"" a soft short, but sweet 30 second paino riff. And even the intro is a great beat, than instead of it sounding like a new track they programmed it to go immediatly into the next track, cause the beats mix together. Guru lyrically is sharp, and he does not need much help, with only 2 guest appearences, and literally 2 guest appearences, sence premo controlls all the hook's with mastery Guru shows his lyrical powress, consistently spitting 30 plus bars in his monotone serious voice every track, except the interludes. In this album DJ premier seems to be the Architect, and Guru seems to be the foundation. Premier uses his mastery of beatmaking, programming, mixing, scatching, and especially sampling to construct a masterpeice around Guru's lyrics which are the foundation. Bottomline, you gotta pick this up if your a Hip Hop Head"
1,"i bought this cd based on the other reviews.  and when i got it, wow, i was very disappointed.  this cd is not good at all.  it may be good to those of you who like dashboard confessional and stuff like that, but it's not to my liking.  i recommend anadivine, coheed and cambria, or armor for sleep well over this cd"
5,"Well, not much to say here. Neil (the bad man with a thousand voices) and company do exactly what the title says: they unleash Pure Rock Fury. Clutch is one of those bands where you can't just listen to two or three tunes off the CD; it demands to be played in its entirety while you and your friends are hopefully partying and freaking out because no band you ever heard in your life jams the way Clutch does. A lot different than the classic Transnational Speedway, but it's still Clutch and every tune is a ten out ten. Don't pass this one up. If you're new to Clutch and want to check one CD out before buying a bunch of them, get Tranational Speedway League first. After that you'll grab every other one: trust me. And don't forget to raise a glass of beer to the live version of Spacegrass on here!   Necrosoul."
2,"Look, Zakk rocks. I've followed his entire career, so when I say Pride and Glory is weak, I mean it. The southern rock twinge is actually pretty cool and Zakk plays some nice solos on the softer tunes on CD. But it always goes back to the same thing for every artist--SONGWRITING. It's just not good here. Too many tracks sound alike and the songs are just thrown together. Track 5 is OK. Rest is mostly filler. Nothing you will remember 5 mins. after you change the CD. Sorry Zakk, but it sounds like you threw this together in 1 drinking binge weekend. Good move to kill the Pride. Now if you want good acoustic and blues from Zakk, get BOOK OF SHADOWS. It blows away this lame effort. Pride and Glory should only be purchased from the bargin bin. ROCK ON BLS"
2,"thats exactly how this album feels! you know, some irish songs and influences are good, but this is ridiculous. when 95% of your lyrical content is irish at least keep it interesting.(spicy mchaggis jig??? what the....?) so i say if your even interested in this cd or something 95% irish, get drunken lullabies or swagger by flogging molly instead, if you dont already have them. id also recommend the new murphys cd ""the warriors code"" if you want faster irish music done good. i give it 2 stars because its not nearly as bad as some of the other stuff out there. oh yeah rocky road to dublin kicks arse....thats about the only reason to even put this cd on. easily the worst DKM albu"
5,"This is the greatest piece of music I have ever heard. Out of my 300 cds, I listen to it the most. It is great to work out to, to drive to, to do anything to. I've been listening to it for 12 years and still find sneaky little percussion nuances that I didn't realize were there. Everything else by Talking Heads and byrne solo, while still brilliant, is not on the same plane. Hilarious lyrics, irresistable grooves, totally original songwriting, white hot rhythm, a masterpiece. When was the last time a song made you feel angst ridden and ecstatic at the same time? ""Something ain't right"" does."
5,"I have looked for this soundtrack for years and I was so glad to finally see it offered. I love the variations on the theme from the Omen II, such as the opening music from the movie, which is why I looked for so long. If you love powerful and furious music, this is for you"
1,"The score to Cast Away is one of my favorites - right up there with Ennio Morricone's underrated instrumentals for ""Once Upon a Time in America"" - and it's a real shame that, apparently, the only album with music from the film is this compilation disc which doesn't even feature the full soundtrack. Luckily I got my hands on an Academy Awards advance album preview for Cast Away - the CD that Universal sent to the Academy Awards crew for Oscar consideration - and it has six beautiful tracks. But I know there are more out there and I think it's time the full soundtrack was released"
4,"While the idea to make a collection of the fall out of punk and hardcore scenes in the 1980s after the great No Thanks box is a really interesting idea yet it proves extremely hard to pull off. Why? Well when punk became new wave and hardcore became alternative, you were left with so many sounds, so many viewpoints. While it totally made the music scene much more interesting compiling it to 4 discs makes it a hard listen sometimes because of that collage of styles. So its a great learning experience for the uninitiated to learn from, and its a great nostalgia trip for those who grew up with this music. For those of us in the middle we are left kinda scratching our chins and flipping over some of the tracks. I must say however that Rhino did choose the prime cuts from each group, and chose the right groups from each scene but thats what Rhino is great at archival material. Its by no means a bad box set in fact its really quite the opposite, but I guarantee even the most open minded listeners will find themselves hitting the skip button past their first listen"
2,Receivied CD in what appears to be a scratched condition. CD won't play well in my vehicle... Almost appears to be a book leg version. Not happy with item
1,"These guys are the biggest joke in rock music. All of these 5 star reviews are an even bigger joke. Ed Kowizsychik(SP) or however you want to spell it sounds as pathetic as he looks. This is garbage, plain & simple. Im glad radio is no longer saturated with their music. 20 years from now, no one will remember this group."
1,"Most of the songs here are ballads of which there are two that I really like:  ""Back Before the War"" and ""She Wasn't Good Enough For Him"".  The rest of the stuff here is unmemorable. "
1,Some songs are o.k. on this but not enough for me to give this CD more than one star.  Its just more crossover stuff. 
1,Waited 22 days only to find the tape was the wrong format.30 days after i returned it was told not in stock.waited another 30 day for a credit
5,"This is a studio-CD with more songs then on the live DVD of the ZU & CO performance in The Royal Albert Hall.  It is a pleasure to listen to the high quality songs (solo and harmony) of Zucchero with world famous artists like Sting, Mouse, Pavarotti, etc. Drive in your car for hours and hours listening to this CD and you never want to stop"
1,"The title is misleading.  This is a collection of New Wave renditions of traditional songs.  Unless you are a New Wave fan, it may drive you nuts.  New Wave adults may love it.  My baby payed little attention in contrast to  BabyGenius' &quot;Favorite Nursery Rhymes&quot; which clearly draws his  interest and smiles"
2,"Pitbull's 3rd album from the 2004 M.I.A.M.I brings something at least different, though not much else, despite some good beats and some good songs, pitbull is just flat and distorted.  This is a somewhat album  Music Rating **1/2 Stars.  So a marginal thumbs down for me."
5,"Having traveled many miles going to bluegrass festivals in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, I have heard some great music. And the wonderful thing about the festivals, it doesn't have to be the headline stars that are so  good, sometimes the &quot;parking lot pickers&quot; are just as enjoyable.  But back to this, I love Ricky Skaggs, I love him for continuing to follow  a narrow path that he has chosen in the music business. that takes a lot of  guts, especially when all the glory goes to the hat acts"
5,"Obviously Mr. T. Hardin is suffering from some musical mental problems. He would apparently refer the knuckle-dragging, amateurish, talentless stylings of the hundreds of bands that play the same three notes a thousand beats per minute while some oaf screams and growls unintelligible garble supposedly using all sorts of elaborate words for 'kill' that neither the band nor the fans know how to use or say properly. OK, now that I've gotten that rant over with, let me continue on to what you really want to read. This was actually the very first Manowar album I heard. A friend picked it up the day it came out, let me borrow it after he listened to it once, and never got it back (sorry Darren). I was forever hooked. The first half of the album is classic, well produced, straight ahead metal. Fantastic, clear solos on each song. The title track is a classic Manowar anthem. It sums up what they are quite well. 'Blow Your Speakers' is not only another trademark metal anthem, but is also the closest Manowar has gotten to an actual ""hit"" in the U.S. ""Carry On"", one of my instant favorites, is and inspirational rally cry; the kind Manowar is known for, among other things. ""Violence and Bloodshed' is a fast and furious return to the Heavy Metal beginnings and Vietnam theme that hasn't been seen since the first album ""Battle Hymns"". All in all the first half of this album is just in your face heavy metal.  The second half is a return to the days of long, long ago. 'Defender' is one of the last things that the late, great Orson Welles ever did before his passing. I listened to this track at least 200 times in the first week I had this album. It aptly sets the tone for the rest of the record. A rich narrative that opens to a powerful crash of truly heavy metal. From this point on, this album does it all. Beautifully clear and powerful bass lines. Articulate and soaring lead solos. Earth shaking Drums. And the absolute best vocals on any recording of the time. 'Drums of Doom' pounds you into 'Holy War' like a charging team of mammoth beasts which then throws you into the 'Master of Revenge', a mystical segue into 'Black Wind, Fire and Steel' which blinds all with the relentless speed and accuracy of both music and lyrics. All done at a rate that almost defies logic. Manowar have definitely cemented there place as the Kings of Metal with this album forevermore. All those who refuse to believe it can go back their amateurs and goons. Leave us and make room for the true men of heavy metal."
4,rip manpac you must not be a rap fan or a jayz fan talkin bout vol 3 was trash and the dynasty was worst u must like them franchise boyz cds or something cause them two albums are two of his best but anyway the dynasty was spose to be a compulation album thats the reason for the guess appereances but its a solid album on bad but underate
1,"The production quality is almost as bad as the depressingly awful music.  Don't be fooled folks.  The ""artistic"" hacks may love it, but beauty is TRUELY in the eye of the beholder. If you enjoyed the awesome first 3 soundtracks; don't waste your money on this one expecting more of the same.    Instead you will receive a CD chocked full of unimaginative (i.e. high-schoolers without talent playing on their home computers) techno and ""spoken word"" type lyrics that are laughably bad (but only if you didn't shell out $13.99 to listen to them).  I'm now the proud owner of a $14.00 coaster, b/c that's about all it's good for"
4,"I must admit I bought this album for the cover alone.  I must also confess that I had never heard of Belphegor.  I was browsing a mom and pop record store looking for hard to find cds and in their new release section I came across ""Pestapokalyspse VI"".  Being a fan of death metal I decided to give it a try.  I'm always looking for new bands to get into.  I am very glad I gave these guys a whirl.   The best way I can describe the sound of this album is that is seems to be a strong combination of Norwegian black metal and death metal.    The heaviest aspect to this record in my opinion is the drums, there are ton of pummeling blast beats that are just relentless from these German dark lords.  As heavy as Belphegor are they also have a strong sense of melody.  After the first two tracks of pummeling death metal the band then slows down a bit with the track ""Angel of Retribution"".  There is some pretty impressive guitar work on this song.  There is also some really dark demonic like chanting on this record which to me Belphegor could write the soundtrack for an Omen film.   In my ignorance I thought this was new band but I believe they have 2 to 3 releases before this one.  After hearing ""PestapokalyseVI"" I would definitely pick up some of there other records.  My suggestion to anyone who is into death and black metal to pick this one up, Belphegor are a great combination of the two styles of extreme metal.  Some of the highlight tracks in my opinion are ""Hell's Amassador"", ""Pest teufel apocalypse"" and ""Seyn todt in Schwartz"".  This is must for any extreme metal head.  A brutal hidden treasure of 2006."
2,"The nightfox laser dance song without question is a sample/remix/remake/ BAM from a part of the score from the 1979 Italian movie, The Concorde Affair. Just saw it on 3-8-07 and saw Ocean 12 like 2 weeks prior.   No doubt it is the same thing only redone.  Randy "
5,"I've been a big fan of Three 2's work as a Convict and w/Blac Monks, but dude def. can put it down on his own.  Took me forever to finally get a copy of this record, but it was worth the wait.  Plenty of laid back flow from Tre Deuce on beats from Houston legends John Bido & Mike Dean.  If you can ever manage to find this album for a reasonable price, i'de recommend coppin' it"
2,"Being a long time fan of MLWTTKK, I immediately pre-ordered this tribute/remix collection. Upon hearing the first few moments of this CD, it was blatantly clear that whoever remixed these Kult classics had little regard for the originals' lustre. The mixes are light, airy.... pure fluff. Don't expect any chest-thumping industrial beats that TKK has delivered to its fans for many a year. The mixes butchered the originals to the point that it's not even novel, just cotton candy filler. How TKK allowed this malformed release is beyond me. The only purpose I see that this ""tribute"" could serve is to introduce TKK to a young lightweight, whose ears are not used to original industrial epics. Either that, or only for the hardcore TKK fan who just wants to have every release. The dust on my copy is already accumulating, and probably will for some time. If you're looking to dip your toes into My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult, don't buy this CD. Stick with the new greatest hits release, or better yet, start with any release prior to ""Hit & Run Holiday"""
5,"I have downloaded all of Black Label Society's albums, and even Book of Shadows and Pride & Glory, but this was the first album i bought in stores. I am a die hard Zakk Wylde fanatic, so, naturally, i love this CD. It combines Zakk's heavy riffs, with his soft melodies like the ones from Book of Shadows, and of course, his ripping solos. I believe that Zakk Wylde is easily one of the top 3 guitarists of all time. If you are a first time Black Label listener, however, I would not reccomend this CD. In order to fully appreciate Black Label Society, you need to start off with Sonic Brew, or Stronger Than Death. Some good songs on those CD's are: Bored To Tears, Lowdown, Beneath the Tree, 13 Years of Grief, and Love Reign Down."
4,"Decca has put together a wide range of early Jazz from a bunch of different artists; some with tracks you would not expect, which I suspect may have been intentional, the dates vary from 1929-1959, but the latter date is a bit misleading (see track list). There is no &quot;modern&quot; jazz here. It is also a self-admitted limited survey, due to the label. Men like Ben Webster and Johnny Hodges are not represented due to the fact that no solos from any Decca, or Decca owned subsidiary, were deemed proper examples of either. But what is included is always classic, even if not the most obvious candidate for the artist. Making up for any shortcomings in that regard is the 79 page booklet included, which is really half the presentation. Well done, informative, and richly packaged, it is a great companion to the disc, and a great gift idea for a jazz aficianado"
2,"This ranks right up there with the Blondie reunion CD as completely unnecessary.  Why?  These guys are RELICS.  And I wouldn't care if the music was great (i.e. Joe Strummer &amp; The Mescaleros new stuff) but this  is just awful.  Why are they still trying to act like jittery teenagers?   And the Spedding songs here are just wretched, at least the Shelley-penned  numbers are merely bad.  By all means, buy Singles Going Steady or  Operator's Manual, as they are priceless landmarks of punk rock, but leave  this Modern dreck in the rubbish tin.  I picked it up for half-price and  should have known better"
1,I liked it better when it was called Alice in Chains!!!!!!!  They should call their band Zapsmack because I would slap the piercings off the singer if I ever saw that 90 lb. wuss.  Songs about witch craft and all that lame hocus pocus mumbo jumbo is about as played out as King Diamond.  booooooooooooooo!!!!!!! this band.  The Zappe
4,"This is the first Plumb CD that I have purchased.  I suspect it won't be the last.  The vocals and overall musical quality is appealing and quite catchy.  The lead singer's voice is really very good.  Lyrically, it is good.  Most of the songs are not very clearly Christian.   One exception is their remake of Michael W. Smith's 'Pray For Me', which is great.  Others have lyrics that occasionally allude to Christian topics such as, 'I Can't Do This'.  There is one line that says, 'I can't do this.  I can't do this by myself.  Oh God, I need your help.'  In spite of the overall lack of Christian oriented lyrics, which I prefer, there is nothing objectionable about the wording in these songs.  I will likely check out another one of their CDs.  This one is very good and seems better each time I listen to it"
1,"I bought this cd because I heard Blood on motorway, in a commercial. I thought it was a hot jig. Will, It wasnt like the commercial. I wasnt expecting Suicide lyrics and empty crys of the synthesizer. It was a waste of my 14.99 and Im resaling it"
5,"I have heard several Bohemes in my time - my favorites being the versions with Pav and Freni; Tebaldi and Bergonzi; and this one. Neither of the first two can match this recording in overall effect. Karajan with Pav/Freni, while firmly in possession of his own wonder, misses by a hair Beecham's sensuous conducting logic. Also Pav is not the best Rodolfo: he sings too opulently to convey a blue, starving poet. The Tebaldi/Bergonzi set is a sure contender, and might have stood right with this one if its sound weren't so bad.       Now as for this set itself - three words say it: Bjoerling with Beecham. These were two of the finest artists of the last century, and it is a blessing to have this record of their collaboration. Jussi, while perhaps not as romantic as Bergonzi, was a Rodolfo for all time. That ringing golden tenor truly could build castles in air. And hell, he was romantic enough for comfort. Add Beecham, and, if you please, you've got glory. His pacing is perfect. Just listen to about midway through ""che gelida manina,"" where Bjoerling soars and Beecham expands the tempo to let Jussi's voice raise the rafters and burn deep. And I tell you what, Jussi could burn. The quantity of air that man had was astonishing at the least, and he didn't waste it: his phrases are easy, well-drawn, and thrilling.      I have no important complaints about anyone else in the cast. I actually prefer de Los Angeles's Mimi, though I think she sometimes doesn't support high notes with enough air. As for the orchestra, there are a few mishaps where accurate entrances with the singers are concerned, but that is hardly surprising - the ensemble was assembled in roughly two days and its memebers had barely played with one another or with Beecham. The sound of the set isn't as good as one might expect from the Great Recordings series, but it is acceptable, and a well-informed ear can fill in any lacking overtones.  Buy it. You'll love it for many years, and then pass down through your family"
5,"wow. a truly underrated album (considering that i'm only the 5th person here on Amazon to review it) and one (of many) of Coltrane's true genius recordings. the playing here is jaw dropingly amazing and tightly focused. the compositions are fast fast fast and executed with confidence, style, and unlimited class. highly recommended for lovers of great jazz and amazing music. highly recommended"
5,"Definitely one for all time...when I first heard 'Raised on Robbery' (on the radio, in Omaha, NE of all places), I immediately had images of a dashing Cary Grant, Gary Cooper type, dressed to the nines, cooling his heels with a Rob Roy in the lounge of the Chrysler Building, not 'the Empire Hotel' replete with all that glorious, stainless steel, polished oak and mother of pearl, art-deco; set in a slight, yet crisp, sepia tone, black and white...Joni painted all that in my mind in 32 bars, then here comes the lady 'in lacy sleeves'...she's a trubador not unlike Dire Straits, Mark Knopfler, a story teller of the highest order and an artist with no peer.  Buy it"
5,"this cd is as good as people say it is.  if you're a fan of enigk, you wont be disappointed.  make sure to pick up his new album ""world waits"", its just as goo"
2,"THIS MAY BE A GOOD SOUNDTRACK, BUT WHAT THE HELL..I'VE SEEN THIS FILM A HUNDRED TIMES, AND I NEVER FROGOT THAT SONG WHEN HE WAS RIDING IN THE HELECOPTOR ON THE WAY TO VIETNAM.I COULDNT REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE SONG AND FORGOT WHO THE ARTIST WAS.SO I SEARCHED ON THE CRAPPY INTERNET.... FOR OVER AN HOUR MY POOR TUSH HURTS, AND I FOUND NOTHING, AND IT'S A CLASSIC SONG!!!!! SO I THOUGHT TO MYSELF MY BROTHER MIGHT KNOW, SO I SAID TO HIM, REMEMBER FORREST GUMP WHEN HE WAS IN THE HELECOPTOR AND THE SONG WENT ""THERE MUST BE SOME WAY OUTTA HERE"" AND IMMEDIATELY HE SAID JIMI HENDRIX, ALL ALONG THE WATCHTOWER.... SHAME SHAME WHOEVER PUT TOGETHER THIS SOUNDTRACK NEEDS TO BE SMACKED UPSIDE THE HEAD.. WHO WOULD FORGET JIMI, AND THAT BEAUTIFUL CLASSIC SONG. NOW I KNOW, NO WONDER I COULDNT FIND IT. IT AINT EVEN ON HERE! AFTER ALL THOSE CLIPS I LISTENED TO. WASTE OF TIME, PLUS WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT TO JIMI FANS."
5,"This is a perfect example of modern heavy metal. After realeasing their first album in 1998 and gaining a small cult following, System of a Down broke through to the mainstream with Toxicity, an album even crazier than it's predecessor, with tricky time-changes, funky drum patterns, fast guitar riffs with odd tunings, and politcal lyrics sung in such a way that it almost makes light of the world's problems. Where their first album is heavier, this one is more complex. You can find yourself in a groove, only to have it change, and seconds later have it change again. There are lots of mosh-worthy moments, and parts that sound almost middle-eastern due to Daron's style and unique tuning.  This album takes a while to get used to, it changes quickly and frequently. John is an amazing drummer and I feel he is too overlooked and doesn't get the recognition he deserves.  The lyrics have a purpose, at times they will make you think, and at times they will make you laugh. These guys are serious, but don't take themselves too seriously.  In my opinion this is their best work and is a must-own for any Sytem fan or metalhead in general, though it may be a little too crazy for some people.  System of a Down on this album is:  Serj Tankian - Lead Vocals, Keyboards, String Arrangements Daron Malakian - Guitars, Backup Vocals Shavo Odadjian - Bass, Vocals John Dolmayan - Drum"
1,"In his interminably boring, mice type liner notes, Brad Mehldau goes to great lengths dispelling the notion that he might sound like Bill Evans. The message being, `Oh golly, there's so much more going on in my playing-Please.' Well, I can assure you, Bill Evans he's not. He wouldn't qualify to give Bill Evans a cab ride uptown. Matter of fact, he sounds more like watered down Keith Jarrett-nothing very original going on here. And if you need 10,000 words of liner notes to explain what you're doing-guess what-you ain't doing squat. As a pianist who's been playing modern jazz for 40 years, I can tell you to sit this set out. And if you want Bill Evans or Keith Jarrett, go get the real thing."
2,The writing needs some work.  This album probably won't see significant rotation in my playlist
5,"Blind Lemon Jefferson was the greatest of the country bluesmen.  (For a measure of my enthusiasm, see my review of the Yazoo set.)    If you dig him enough, or are curious enough, to want his entire output in one place for a budget price, then by all means this is the package to buy.  But completeness and price are the top virtues of this set.  If you want to hear these records at their best, with careful attention to making them sound clear and present, the Yazoo one-disc compilation still leads the pack, far and away.  Except for a slightly better mastering job, these four discs mirror the four separate BLJ volumes on Document.  In fact, I would not be surprised to learn that these _are_ the old Document masters, run through a noise reduction system.  The sound quality is quite uneven:  the better-sounding takes sound pretty good, but some of the others are awful.  The version of "" 'Lectric Chair Blues,"" one of Lemon's finest records, as heard here is terribly worn and noisy, to the point of being unintelligible.  Also true of the same track on the Document.  On Yazoo, it's a wonderful listen and you can hear and understand all of the words.  ""Long Lonesome Blues,"" take 2, is also nearly inaudible.  On the Yazoo, it sounds as if they may have been working with the same 78 disc, but the results are much improved.  JSP Records gained a stellar reputation because its earliest roots-and-jazz compilations were mastered by the late John R. T. Davies, who was a genius at resurrecting old recordings and making them sound real.  But this is not one of those sets.  So:   With Lemon Jefferson, you always get quality music, and with this JSP collection you get nearly all of it.  (Several alternate takes are not here.)   But if sound quality is an issue, I have to recommend Yazoo's ""Best of."
5,"Although Elisabeth Withers has appeared with lots of well known people this solo album is a rare talent to behold. A good blend of slow relaxing music & mid tempo R n B, she surely will go on to greater things from her"
5,"This album sizzles with energy, honesty, and ""I'll MAKE you pay attention"" entertainment spirit.  This was his big breakthrough album and it's not hard to see why.  Every single track is excellent, and each very different from what went before.  From start to finish, the emphasis is on simple Beatleish rock arrangements, played with finesse by a great backing band, with the piano front and center.  It starts off with plain rock and roll - Moving Out, with its thumpy rhythm and brilliant ending.  The Stranger (apart from its stylish intro and outro) is a bit more funky, with a lovely bridge/chorus.  The much maligned Just The Way You Are suffers from a bit of cheesiness in production (Billy Joel calls this ""Phil Ramone's Bossa Nova version), but is still a good heartfelt song for his first wife (whatever happened to her anyways?).  The centrepiece of the album is Scenes, this is Billy Joel's tour-de-force to show everyone what he can do on the ivories.  Vienna is a beautiful ballad, and Only the Good Die Young is a hilarious dance tune, still racy 30 years later.  Always a Woman is played a bit stiffly on piano, and borders on cheesy lyrics, but still a great tune.  The next two tracks are a *bit* weaker, but have their moments and are still brilliant songs, just in comparison with what came before...  He came close to topping this album on Glass Houses but this still stands as his finest album.  If you're going to have just one of his albums, I would recommend this."
5,"Stunningly beautiful. Coltrane plays his heart out, as does McCoy Tyner. Bonus tracks are fantastic"
5,"I LOVE IT!! BUT THEN AGAIN, I LOVE ALL HIS CD'S, HE IS THE BEST AT WHAT HE DOES! HAVE SEEN HIM SEVERAL TIMES IN CONCERT, AND IF YOU EVER GET A CHANCE TO SEE HIM, DO IT !! IT WILL BE WELL WORTH THE $$"
5,"Unbelivable!!!  buddy rich is the master when it comes to drumming!!!   This CD is filled with many solos... not just from the master, but also from others in the band.  he had by far the best horn section in the the world and it is definitely captured by this AWESOME cd.   I find NO problems when it comes to sound or anything else.  If you like jazz, druming, solos, or just buddy rich, you NEED to get this"
5,"I've been listening to PT for several years now, and have found their music most moving.  I really wouldn't care if they sound like Pink Floyd, or whomever.  I don't believe that Steven Wilson sits around trying to imitate one group or another.  I think it could be said that most artists have their influences from many sources, from many inspirations.  So, thank you Steven for re-issuing this CD, and adding such quality and care to the songs.  I believe you will influence many other future artists with your creativity.  You certainly influence me to listen and enjoy.  After all, my son and I travelled over 150 miles, one way, just to see PT in Michigan, and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of the concert"
1,"Now before you shrug me off as a hater...I just want to make it clear that I love Rob Zombie...I am more of a White Zombie fan because they just have so much more going on in the music and lyrics than Rob has even come close to with his solo endevors. White Zombie made some of the most amazing music of the 90s. I like Hellbilly Deluxe, it's a very good album, not near as tantalizing as anything White Zombie did, but still very good. This album however is a complete departure from everything before it. The only good tracks are Sinners Inc & Transylvanian Transmissions, what some would call ""fillers"" a labeling i despise, these 2 tracks are amazing, and the ozzie track is alright, but everything else is just mindless ramblings and power cords rolled into a brainless shpeil of banter about nothing. I so do not dig this whole poppy thing hes doin in the slightest. Hellbilly deluxe is a far supirior album, while this album is not even worthy of being compared to anything White Zobmie did. Alas Rob...what happened? Why God? Why? But dont take my word for it...listen to those cuts from the tracks amazon posts. They all suck. Nuff Said...Rob...your next album better kick ass, thats all i gotta say"
5,What more can be said?  This album blows so many great albums in rock history away.  I became a fan of Dishwalla when I was 15.  I bought their first CD like a week before Counting Blue Cars started getting airplay everywhere.  But ever since I got this amazing CD I have just not enjoyed Pet Your Friends nearly as much as I used to.  That's not trashing Pet Your Friends.  This album's just that amazing.   
1,"Gee,the CD seemed fine. My favorites are here. ""Everything She Wants"" (original),""Freedom"",""Young Guns (Go For It)"",""Where Did Your Heart Go?"",""Careless Whisper""...hey,wait a second...""Careless Whisper"" ain't on here. The ultimate George Michael/Wham! ballad and this is supposed to be a greatest hits album and that song missed? ""A Different Corner"" also? Because of stupid remixes of ""I'm Your Man"" & ""Everything She Wants""?  Huh,I rather listen to ANDREW RIDGELEY's solo album than those remixes. Really! Psyche"
5,"Don't ever forget Ruth Brown, one of the greatest female rock singers of the 1950's. She had the two minor hits on this CD, Lucky Lips and This Little Girl's Gone Rockin', but there is so much more. Every cut on this CD is an absolute winner. She is greatly overlooked but I think she tops Etta James and LaVerne Baker. This is a terrific CD and she is the best"
2,I think all the songs sound the same and like she is trying to sound like Avril. 
5,"...don't pass Tower of Power by.  This band is smokin.'  They have it all, great vocals, great compositions, great horns and arrangements.  I would have loved to see Man From The Past on this one, but overall a very solid collection.  So Very Hard To Go is top notch material - one of my all time favorites and they have so many great tunes - Below Us All The City Lights, Down To The Nightclub, What Is Hip, This Times It's Real, Only So Much Oil.  Easily one of the best bands from the 70's.  Got to have this one"
2,"As with most Greatest Hits collections, the record company leaves off just enough hits to make you wonder &quot;What they were thinking?&quot; They also put on a few tracks that make you wonder &quot;What were they  thinking?&quot; Here, there are some obscure tracks that clearly are  &quot;filler&quot; while omitting some of his best tracks from rock radio  and even Top 40 Hits? Where is I Found Somebody? (Oops, that was only his  first Top 40 &quot;hit&quot;) Where is &quot;Partytown&quot;? (Probably his  best party song and a big hit on AOR radio in the early 80's). &quot;Don't  Give Up&quot; was also a rock radio track and a great song from his first  album. I would title this album &quot;Some Hits, Some Mediocre Stuff, Some  Stuff Sorely Missing, Sorry.&quot; Now, where is that Eagles box set we  have been waiting 20 years for"
1,"After much much excitement and almost 20 bucks layed out I was extremely disappointed. The music was really slow, boring and rather dull. The songs start to seem like they're the same as the lack ones. Maybe I'm just too used to other trance but I couldnt' find any trance in this cd"
5,"I owned this (the movie version) years ago as a record and loved it.  Then I got rid of my records and switched to CD's.  After several years I was missing my Camelot music.  So I bought the Broadway cast version with Julie Andrews & Richard Burton (how could I go wrong?!?).  I was quite disappointed and over the next couple years only listened to Camelot, perhaps, once more.  Finally, I realized that I needed to buy the movie version of Camelot with Vanessa Redgrave and Richard Harris.  Wow, I am delighted once again!!  Now I find myself humming the songs and looking forward to hearing Camelot again."
5,"My wife and I just returned from the John Jorgenson concert in Jonesborough, TN.  We agreed that neither of us expects to ever hear a finer guitarist!  We bought two of his CDs during intermission (including Franco-American Swing).  As much as we will enjoy listening to them for years to come, nothing will replace the rare privilege of ""seeing"" this master play.  The experience can't be described with words.  The audience even gave him a standing ovation at the intermission of his two set show!  And two more before the end of the evening's concert. Buy this CD ... you aren't likely to regret it.  And check out his web site www.johnjorgenson.com to see if he is playing anywhere near you.  It will be worth the drive to catch his show. "
4,"Although not as beautiful as her previous release(s) this album is still a triumph of beauty.  Her voice is still undeniably pleasant here, and every song has its strength.  Personal highlights include 'The Light', 'Image Of' and 'Blessings Flow'.  Certainly a complete change of style from her older work, but still more than sufficient for any Michelle Tumes fan and anyone into Christian music"
2,"Yuck. On first listen, this album sounds like Robbie trying to do Madonna and then Eminem.  The vocals are monotonous, the beats the same. It's dance music, and not my cup of tea. I'll give it another listen, but I'm guessing there will be maybe 2 songs I'd want to keep on this cd. Pau"
4,"This review concentrates on the four live tracks.  By December 1970, Miles Davis' fusion was evolving even beyond the Bitches Brew era. The emphasis was more and more in the rhythm, and less and less on coherent solos. Miles Davis stuck a wah-wah pedal on his horn, getting a sound that was thin, whiny and rather annoying. Keith Jarrett and Michael Henderson joined the band, lending the band a unique keyboard sound and a funkier bass respectively.   Live Evil basically consists of several edited jams from the Cellar Door recordings of December 1970.   SIVAD: The recording begins on a high point; vicious funk punctuated by Airto Moreira's squawking Cuica, and stabbed through with Miles Davis' electric trumpet. This is actually a version of ""Directions"" by Joe Zawinul, although the tune is so evolved it is basically unrecogniseable. The statements of the theme have been excised with a razor blade. Miles' horn is electric, and its sound is a mixture of Birth of the Cool and Axis: Bold as Love. Truly strange, and frankly not a very nice sound.  Three and a half minutes in, the groove shifts to ""Honky Tonk"", a minimalistic and not very inspiring theme. The performance is sellotaped together from two separate live performances of the tune (!) and one studio version! Miles sometimes plays with an open horn on this section; and Airto Moreira makes weird wailing noises that sound rather corny. Sloppy and shapeless.   WHAT I SAY: A feature for Jack de Johnette, a terrific drummer. The groove is extremely harsh and energetic, with Miles soloing with an open horn. Unlike the other tracks, this is actually a complete performance (segueing into ""Sanctuary"" at the end) and is quite impressive. I really like Jarret's electric piano/organ solo and Johnette's drum solo!   FUNKY TONK/INAMORATA: In which Teo Macero goes nuts with the scissors. This is actually one big slab of a performance, cut arbitrarily in half to fit both sides of an LP. And it is not one piece of music, but three: 1. ""Directions"": Yet another performance of Zawinul's piece. Much more conventional than the ""Sivad"" version, though again with all the statements of the theme cut out. Miles soloes with electric trumpet.  2. Then the groove shifts to a piece which resembles the Mission Impossible theme! So this is where they got that theme. The name of the tune is sometimes called ""Funky Tonk"", and sometimes ""Inamorata"". A very long, sloppy, shapeless morass of solos. Again, Jarret's solo is most beautiful.  3.Finally the groove shifts to ""It's About That Time"" from ""In a Silent Way"". A performance that does not shift into the second bassline. Halfway through a gloomy voice narrates a weird, associative poem about the mysteries of Music.  At the fade-out, you can hear the groove shifting to ""Sanctuary...""  Overall, the album is extremely messy, with a good deal of self-indulgent excess masking some excellent soloing. Atmospheric and very dense."
2,"I was not feeling this album at all which is strange because I like Mac Dre and Dubee quite a bit.  I was not feeling the tracks.  It was too funk oriented, with some dumb sounding tracks.  It was not the smooth type of production that I expected to hear coming out of Vallejo.  A big disappointment"
2,"The debut Blues Traveler CD was truly fascinating.  Great jams fueled by some catchy songs such as Gina, But Anyway, Warmer Days, and Sweet Talkin' Hippie.    This follow up Travelers and Thieves CD has many good jams but many unmemorable tunes.  As talented as the instrumentalists might be, after a while the endless noodling gets a little boring if a good melody is not present.  All In The Groove is possibly the only piece with a noteworthy melody.  Mountain Cry is not bad in the background with some good vocal interplay between John Popper and guest, Greg Allman. In time I could appreciate it a bit more.  Onslaught is semi-memorable if a bit chaotic.  However, the overall impression is that of boredom.  The tunes all seem to blend together with little in the terms of variety and even originality.  Even Popper's harmonica blasts get wearisome midway through this CD.  The discriminating fan will choose the first CD, Four, and Straight Until Morning and pass on this mess. "
4,"Reading all these reviews, you've got a whole buncha people bashing on this CD because it's a dance album.  Well, to all you that don't know Norman Cook, AKA Fatboy Slim is in fact a dance artist who produces dance music, don't go into this album expecting anything different.  Mr. Cook is a genious and his singles time & time again are proven not only to be sucessful, but also timeless(aside from the tracks that the top 40 radio DJs get ahold of and cram down our throats a zillion times until we never wanna hear 'em again...  Thanks for that by the way, you're doing the world a great service).  As far as not understanding ""Star 69"",; what is there to understand.  ""Star 69"" was made for one reason & one reason only, to make you shake your butt.  If you're looking for meaning in music, go listen to Yanni, or Enya, or Celine Dion, only listen to Fatboy if you wanna boogie to the MFin' oogie.  As far as the guy bashin' ""Bird Of Prey"", it's Jim Morrison dude; what more do you need.  For those of you who don't know musicians outside of the Backseat Boys, Jim's the lead singer from The Doors, & one of the few truely brilliant musicians of ours any other generation... ever.  Basically I'll put it like this, don't bash on the man because you're to sheltered to understand good music unless it's played for you twice every hour on the hour on the radio or MTV.  Cook's music'll be around alot longer than any one of your 1 hit wonder's out there.  Just because Norman makes his own music, & not from some mold given to him by some slimey record executive doesn't mean his music is bad.  If you don't get it fine, but don't bash on something just because you're to shallow or close minded to understand.  Open your ears and give it a shot, your brain will thank you"
1,"His previous album ""You've come along way baby"" was so good and original but now it seems like he's spending more time on his music videos then on the music, many songs on this Cd are also based on samples from older songs like ""Star 69"" and ""Weapon Of Choice"" and ""Sunset"" some say he's matured as a artist but when something worked pretty good why don't continue in that way instead of making the oddest songs he could think of. Norman Cook is a dance artist and there's no way he should try to do something he isn't used to. Bootsy Collins ""Weapons of choise"" and Macy Gray ""Love life"" is Cd, so does the Voice of Jim Morrison on ""Sunset"" but they cannot save this album from fiasco, to me it feels like the guest attists take too much place, it's no longer so much of the original fat boy slim sound here. ""Yo Mama"" got a cool sound though, but he could have tried to do something more with that song. ""Song for shelter"" is dark and slow aswell, think he even released it on single. Let's just wait for a better time, this album was really a flop"
5,I have follow Ana throught her beginnings as a member of the Spanish pop band Mecano and became very intrigue by her angel like voice and absolutely progressive themes in her earlier years with the band.  I very much  anticipated a new release from Mecano but when I heard the band had split  up assumed that her career was over.  I was very delighted to hear she had  went on as a solo and knew that her new CD would probably become a new  classic in my CD collection.  I found every song in this release as  pleasing as all her former recordings
1,"You'll see other postings here that discuss the details of what Capitol's engineer did on this 1998 release to reduce hiss, etc.  Believe it.  Compared to the 1991 version of the disc or the better Mobile Fidelity gold disc (1990) this version is awful. It's like a bucket of mud was dumped over his vocals. There  are a bunch of threads on this topic on the forums of Steve Hoffman, one of the best sound engineers in the business. But the bottom line is most people who care about this music would like to see Capitol go back to the original master tapes and treat Frank right. The mastering issues apply to a lot of the 1998 Sinatra discs labeled ""Entertainer of the Century"" on the side"
2,"A relentlessly trendoid pastiche intended for the North American kewl market.  It cobbles together the offerings of many fine and varied artists, but the association implies that there is a ""new thing"" here - in the sense of the original bossa nova or tropicalia, which isn't the case.  Rather being something new, it is an example of unassimilated influences.  Some North American influences have been ""eaten,"" perhaps especially by artists connected with Bahia, but that's not really on the table here. Virginia Rodrigues career has been stalled from day one because she is essentially unable to use her great voice - she simply can't move her butt stylistically - thus, her inclusion here is a bit of unintentional irony.  Brasil has a tremendously complex folk and pop musical reservoir and a sophisticated modern music industry - this stuff is definitely not the sharpest tooth of the cutting edge"
1,"Eigentlich find ich ""I believe"" ganz gut, und wollte mir das Album von Bro'Sis möglicherweise kaufen. Als ich es im Laden gespannt gehört hab, bin ich fast aus den Latschen gekippt!! Sie versuchen einen auf cool zu machen, mit HipHop, Rap...Selbst die beiden Girlies versuchen zu klingen wie HipHopper!! Es klingt einfach nur lächerlich! Dieses ""nicht könnende, aber versuchte Rappen"" klingt total doof! Ich hätte nicht gedacht das ein Album soooo schlecht sein kann!!! Tut mir Leid, doch für mich sind Bro'Sis gestorben! Ich glaube nicht das sie so weit kommen wie die No Angels- auch wenn sie mehr Singles in einer Woche verkauften als die NA, werden sie es nicht schaffen mit dieser ""Musik"" durchzukommen! Sorry!  =("
1,"HAHAHA!! Ich kann nicht mehr!!!!  Was is das denn? Kommerz Trance sollte man das nennen!! Echt lächerlich was die heutzutage zu bieten haben!! DIESE CD HAT DEN NAMEN TRANCE NICHT VERDIENT!! Also wer Trance oder insgesamt elektronische Musik mag, für den is diese CD wie ein Trip in die Hölle!!! Für Bauern mit Gummistiefeln is das natürlich genau das richtige!! ;) Naja, man merkt ja das im Fernsehen und in den charts nur noch scheiße gibt!! Ok, war das mal anders  :p!! Diese CD ist auf jedem Fall ein Witz und eine Beleidigung für jede Art elektronischer Musik!! Also FINGER WEG VON DEM MIST!!!!"
1,"Was soll man nur mit so einem Kindertechno anfangen? Kein bass kein beet nichts, und alles irgendwie wie von Kindern gesungen und komponiert. Das ist kein Techno. Sowas kann man vielleicht auf die nächste Tigerentenclub CD brennen aber doch nicht auf eine Future Trance! Alle vorherigen teile waren einfach Spitze und haben sich immer mehr gesteigert. Und nun? Völliger Absturz. Sorry, aber das ist doch nur Müll auf der CD."
5,Eine echt geile nummer zum Abtanzen und feiern ein echt gut gelungenes Remix( EaV ) mit echt tollen Rimixes auf der Singel echt toll im alt bewehrten guten Groove Coverage Stayl
2,"Seine Songs sind nicht mehr so gut wie früher. Mit ""Nessajah"" oder ""Weekend"" hatte er es richtig gebracht. Seit seinem Comback läuft aber gar nichts mehr rund. ""Behind the cow"" ""Lass uns tanzen"", waren unter aller Sau. Sein neuer Hit ist wieder einen Tick besser, aber kommt nicht mehr an frühere Erfolge heran, es fehlt das gewisse Etwas!"
2,"Hier geht die Post ab. Ein Feuerwerk an komplexen Rhythmen, verwinkelten Melodielinien und obervirtuosen Soli. Keiner der Instrumentalisten läßt sich die Butter vom Brot nehmen und Tony MacAlpine ist in der Gitarristenwelt sträflich unterbewertet. Was mich an dieser Musik stört ist der Mangel an griffigen Melodien, an Hooks, die im Ohr hängen bleiben. Die Musiker bewegen sich in ihrem eigenem abgekapselten Universum (ha!) und da ist schwer reinzukommen, selbst bei gutem Willen. Gehört zu den CDs, die ich zwei-, dreimal höre, weglege und der ich in einem Jahr dann nochmal eine Chance gebe. Schade!"
1,"Scooter beweisen auf diesem Album eines, sie sind die absoluten Meister wenn es um Melodien klauen oder Songs kopieren geht. Das ganze Album besteht nur aus Songs die entweder komplett gecovert sind oder vollgestopft sind mit geklauten Melodien aus anderen Songs. Einzige Ausnahme ist der Instrumental Song Mesmerized. Wobei man bei Scooter selbst hier nicht sicher gehen kann. Denn selbst das Intro ist kopiert. Totale Enttäuschung!"
5,"Noch ein Highlight in diesem noch jungen Jahr. Ich hätte nicht gedacht, das Disbelief nach dem schon absolut starken Album ""Worst Enemy"" im letzten Jahr nach so kurzer Zeit wieder ein Hammeralbum rausbringen können. ""Shine"" ist ein Muß für alle Extrem Metal-Liebhaber.Irgendwie klingt das neue Album positiver und nicht so deprimierend und düster wie ""Worst Enemy"". Das Album hat schöne Melodien und die typischen Gitarrenklänge von Disbelief. Und der Sänger holt wieder alles aus seiner Stimme heraus und diese Stimme liebe ich. Shine ist einfach nur genial. Ich liebte es schon nach dem ersten Durchlauf."
2,"Ich muß zugeben, ich kann bis heute nicht nachvollziehen, warum dieses Album von THE DUSKFALL in der deutschlandweiten Musikpresse sooo mit guten Kritiken überhäuft wurde.  Meiner Meinung nach bietet „Source"" nichts anderes als normalen, herkömmlichen Göteborg-Sound, wie sie Combos wie IN FLAMES, DARK TRANQUILITY oder ARCH ENEMY bereits vor Jahren gespielt haben. Das ganze ist natürlich alles andere als schlecht gemacht. Und an ihren Instrumenten sind die Jungs sicherlich auch überdurchschnittlich. Aber es fehlen mir persönlich einfach die Aha-Momente. Die Songs knallen zwar ordentlich, bleiben aber nicht wirklich im Gehör kleben. Für den Moment ganz nett, aber über weite Sicht nur eine Scheibe unter vielen. Und somit fehlt noch eine ganze Ecke, um mit den oben genannten Bands mithalten zu können. Nächstes mal wünsche ich mir einfach mehr Harmonien oder herausragende Killer-Refrains, die diesen Sound für mich einfach auszeichnen. Übrig bleibt ein Album, das man sich gewiß anhören KANN, aber ganz bestimmt nicht MUSS. Zudem ist die Spielzeit mit 30 Minuten doch arg kurz geraten. Aber das ist kein Qualitätskriterium, denn die Musik sollte für sich sprechen. Und rein musikalisch hauts mich einfach nicht um...deshalb NUR 2 Sterne."
1,"Das Projekt ""Systems in Blue"" ist die Antwort auf die Frage, was passiert, wenn irgendwelche ""Künstler"" sich von einem Erfolgsproduzenten lossagen und im Fehrnsehen groß herum possaunen dass sie jetzt ohne den besagten Produzenten voll durchstarten werden. Das sind diejenigen die großspurig behaupten, sie könnten es besser und sie bräuchten  keinen Dieter Bohlen um erfolgreich zu sein.  Der Erfolg gibt ihnen Recht: keine Fernsehauftritte, keinerlei Chartplatzierungen  und im Endeffekt müssen sie sich mit dem begnügen, was ihnen von einem Mann, der es besser wusste und konnte, übrig geblieben ist.  ""Point of no Return"" ist zu offensichtlich eine schlechte Kopie von einem Sound, der sich seit dem Jahre 1984 immer wieder bewehrt hat. Die Musik ist billig produziert und sogar die ""hohen Töne"" werden zum Teil falsch gesungen. Der Beweis dafür, dass der ""echte Bohlen Sound"" trotz seiner Einfachheit nicht kopiert werden kann. Besonders ""Magic Mystery"" ist eine mehr als schlechte Imitation und Kopie des wirklichen Erfolgssongs ""Magic Symphony"". Der ""Held der russischen Jugend"" hätte sicher eine passende Kritik zu dieser Scheibe.  Allen Fans von Modern Talking, Blue System und vor allem von Dieter Bohlen kann ich nur dringend raten, die Finger davon zu lassen!"
5,"Eines der besten Alben aller Zeiten. Schöne Melodien, rockige Nummern, vielfältig... Großes Meisterwerk von Incubus"
5,"""You're trapped!"" Der Opener ""Enter Dystopia"" zeigt dem Hörer gleich, was ihm für das inzwischen fünfte Album der Gundelsheimer bevorsteht. Man ist sofort wieder gefangen in Lanfears Welt und die wieder mal viel zu langen drei Jahre, die seit dem letzten Werk vergangen sind, sind spätestens beim ersten Gitarrensolo von Markus Ulrich vergessen. In den letzten Jahren war die Band alles andere als untätig und präsentiert mit Nuno Miguel de Barros Fernandes nicht nur einen neuen Mann am Mikro sondern auch eine leichte Stilkorrektur. Lag ""Another Gold Rage"" oberflächlich noch auf dem ähnlichen stilistischen Weg des überragenden Vor-Vorgänger ""The Art Effect"" (ohne jedoch dessen Langzeitwirkung zu entfalten), so liegt die Sache bei vorliegendem Rundling wieder geringfügig anders. Auf den ersten Hör ist man so eingängig wie nie zuvor, einige Tracks entfalten gar ein bisher ungeahntes kommerzielles Potential und sämtliche Refrains sind einfach nur fantastisch. Nach einigen Hördurchgängen mehr merkt man erst, mit wie vielen doppelten Böden Hauptsongwriter Ulle gearbeitet hat, um dieses Mal wirklich alles richtig zu machen. Unzählige Details, überraschend Songwendungen, metallische Grundhärte, immer wieder diese latent melancholische Ausrichtung und ein wie die Faust aufs Auge passender neuen Shouter sind Garant für ein abermals überragendes Melodic-Feuerwerk, welches schon jetzt enorme Langzeitwirkung verspricht. Ein paar Beispiele für die kreative Hochphase der Band: ""My Will Be Done"" beginnt als reinrassiger Power Metal-Stampfer, Refrain und Vocalmelodien sind dann fast schon AOR verdächtig. ""Brave New Men"" ist schon bei den Strophenmelodien Gott, die Bridge und der Chorus setzt dem Ganzen dann noch die Krone auf. Dann folgt ab 2:53 eine eigentlich supersimple Keyboard-Melodie, die mir aber seit dem ersten Hören nicht mehr aus dem Kopf geht. Gesanglich ist Herr Fernandes auch hier ein absoluter Gewinn. Dann folgt ""The Question Keeper"", dessen Breitwand-Refrain auch von Threshold stammen könnte. Gigantisch auch ""A Twin Phenomenon"", welches die Lanfear-Definition von Progressive-Metal darstellt - verschachtelt, hoch-komplex, aber niemals verkopft. Auf diesem Niveau bewegt sich das gesamte Album - sämtliche Songs zünden eigentlich schon beim ersten Mal, aber auch beim zwanzigsten Abspielen des Silberlings entdeckt man eine neue Feinheit, die man zuvor noch nicht bemerkt hat. So sollte Musik eigentlich sein."
5,"Ich musste mich erst etwas reinhören, aber dann hat sie gezündet.  ADAM &amp; EVE ist das bisher am besten produzierte Album der Flower Kings! Der Sound ist mehr als gelungen."
5,"Die CD ist einfach etwas sehr Schönes.  Rilkes Gedichte sind schon ohne Musik sehr schön. Durch die Bearbeitung und Vertonung sind die Werke von Rilke noch viel schöner geworden! Musik und Gedicht sind aufeinander abgestimmt und die Stimmen der Prominenten passen auch sehr gut zu den einzelnen Gedichten!  Die CD ist zum Entspannen super geeignet. Man versinkt in eine andere Welt und lässt sich von Musik und Text tragen.  Eine super schöne CD, nicht nur für Rilke-Liebhaber!"
1,"Diesen Schund kann man doch echt niemanden zumuten, das ist nicht das wahre Offenbarung23 und auch nicht die Grundidee des wahren Autoren der Serie, die Folgen 1-29 kann ich jedem empfehlen der ein Anspruchsvolles Hörspiel erleben möchte aber diese ""neuen"" Folgen kann man echt vergessen. Ich hoffe Jan finded einen kompetenden Audio Verlag der sein Werk mit ihm produziert. Diese Schmieren Komödie ist echt das letzte."
1,"Da sieht man einmal, wie wichtig die Arbeit der ansonsten allzu oft unterschätzten Autoren ist.  Sprecherleistung: Top Produktion: Top Marketing: Top Plot: Unterirdisch Skript &amp; Dialoge: B-Niveau Inhalt: An der Haaren herbeigezogen Verschwörungstheorie: Nicht vorhanden Sorry - DAS geht gar nicht. An den rechtlichen Auseinandersetzungen und den damit verbundenen Auflagen kann man leider nichts ändern. Was mich ärgert ist, dass man O23 DURCHAUS so hätte weiterführen können, dass über 80% der Stammhörer es auch in der neuen Form akzeptiert hätten. In der jetzigen Form ist es der Untergang einer der besten Hörspielreihen, die es je gab."
1,"Es ist zum verzweifeln...  Es gibt Unmengen talentierter Musiker und Sänger die nie ihre Unterschrift unter einen vernüftigen Plattenvertrag setzten dürfen, da Talent und Können leider nicht sehr gefragt sind. Ein Gesicht des Typs Mädchenschwarm ist da wesentlich hilfreicher.  Da macht es dann auch nichts, wenn man nur sehr durchschnittlich singen kann und im Repertoir nichts anderes als ein paar ausgelutschte Klassiker hat."
2,Tut mir leid als Kellyfan das schreiben zu müssen. Das positive Gefühl von früher ist auf dieser Platte nicht mehr zu hören. So Sch ... habe ich mich nach einer Kelly-CD noch nie gefühlt. Hoffen wir auf bessere Tage.
4,"Die Koblenzer Neofolkloristen überraschen auch diesmal wieder mit einer erhabenen Scheibe, auf der die Katharer mit ihrer Festung Montsegur, König Barbarossa sowie Morgaine le Fay besungen werden."
5,"Nur wenige Bands dürfen sich in einem Atemzug mit Dornenreich nennen lassen. Dornenreich sind Ausdruck, Gefühl und unglaubliche Intensität, verpackt in wort -und klanggewaltige Gewänder. Evíga ist der wohl charismatischste und fähigste Sänger, den die Musikwelt hervorgebracht hat. Und ich verwende diesen Superlativ absolut bewußt. Kein anderer versteht es, Emotionen derart gekonnt der Hörerschaft zu übermitteln, und auf der ""Her von welken Nächten"" ist dies in Perfektion zu bewundern. Für jeden, der Musik nicht nur als Ruhestörung nebenher laufen lässt, sondern sich in Verbundenheit bewußt damit zu beschäftigen weiß, sei dieses Album mit Nachdruck empfohlen. Lässt man sich darauf ein, raubt es einem den Atem."
5,"Die Terrorgruppe beglückt uns endlich mit einem Live-Album, dass den sonderbaren Namen ,,Blechdose'' trägt. Aber schon mit dem ersten richtigen Lied (Nazis Im Haus), da ,,Konferenzschaltung'' nur ein Intro ist, geht der Pogo ab. Ich persönlich kenne die Terrorgruppe erst seit einem Monat und hab mir dieses Album zugelegt und kann nur sagen: That's Punkrock! Man merkt einfach, dass die Band live super ist. Für alle die WIZO, Die Ärzte oder Blink-182 mögen, ist das Album ein MUSS! Jedes Lied ist wohl ein eigener Höhepunkt, so zeigt das Album eigentlich keine Schwächen auf (außer vielleicht ,,5 Kilo''). Jedenfalls ist die Cd zu 100% ihre (recht weniges) Geld wert!"
5,"Roberto Alagna und Angela Gheorghiu,schon lange ein Paar,bieten auf dieser Platte eine überragende Leistung, sowohl stimmlich als auch in ihrer Interpretation.Angela Gheorghiu verklärt alle Partien mit ihrer lyrischen Stimme, ist höhensicher und singt feine Pianissimi,auch an Ausdruck mangelt es nicht.Roberto Alagna hat zwar hier und dort einige kleine Probleme, steht seiner Partnerin aber in nichts nach.Alle 19 Titel sind sehr gelungen, was heute schon fast unmöglich zu hören ist. Die Partien aus Don Carlos, Rigoletto, I Masnadieri sowie Aida sind besonders gelungen. Eine Bereicherung für jede Klassik Sammlung."
5,"Die passendste Bezeichnung für diesen neuen Geniestreich der Reiter wäre wohl, Lieder die das Leben schreibt. Hier ist für jede Gemütsstimmung was dabei. Vom reitertypischen Deathmetal ""Der Teufel"" bis hin zur locker swingenden Nummer ""Lazy Days"". Die breitgefächerte Musikvielfalt ist wieder unübertrefflich! Mit diesem Album beweisen die Reiter einmal mehr, dass man sie nicht in irgendeine Schublade stecken kann, sondern dass sie einfach ihr Ding machen, und zwar Musik, die einfach nur Spaß macht. Vom ersten Track der CD bis zum Letzten! Ein Schwachpunkt ist nicht auszumachen! In diesem Sinne! Can you feel the power, we will push it to the max, all for one and one for all, we are Reitermaniacs!"
5,Gar nicht schlecht was uns die Truppe rund um die beiden Schweden Christopher und Michael Amott und die deutsche Frontkreischerin Angela Gossow da um die Ohren haut!
1,"Keine Frage, ""Sulang...."" war DER Hit der Karnevalssession 2004. In jeder Kneipe, Superstimmung, wirklich klasse."
2,"Ein alltägliches Problem: Fler, jung, motiviert ist gut. Zuerst mit Bushido (White&amp;Black sind für mich immer noch das ideale Duo) und dann alleine. Ja, die erste eigene Scheibe, jeder Track hörbar und die Scheibe rotierte hier bei uns auf jeder Party, weil einen alles ansprach- Texte und Musik. Dann kam das ""Mixtape 90210"". Blöder Titel, zugegeben, aber krasse Scheibe mit leckeren Samples und fiesen Texten unter Gürtellinie. Fler wird überall gefeiert und nun muß ne zweite Scheibe her. Es kommt, wie es kommen muß, sie ist lahm. Die Texte reissen einen nicht mit, bis auf ""Cüs Junge"" und ""Vater Morgana"" (da ich selber mit so etwas gelebt habe), da helfen auch keine Kumpels, wie Sido. Ich habe die Scheibe dreimal durchgehört, aber irgendwie taucht eben jetzt das auf, was jeden Musiker treffen kann- er wird kommerziell und produziert unter Druck- schade. 2 Sterne für deine Mühe, Alta! Für alle Aggro Fans- Finger weg von der Scheibe, da könnt ihr auch gleich die Hartz von Eko kaufen! Dann lieber auf G-Hot warten oder die neue von Busta Rhymes. Da ist noch Aussage drin!"
1,"Anna war einmal vor Jahren ein Star... Das was heute von ihr uebrig geblieben ist, hat mit Anna nichts mehr zu tun........."
1,"Ich habe fast alle CDs von Subway gehört, warscheinlich war ich desshalb von dem neuen Werk enttäusch. Ich kann nicht verstehen warum eine Mittelalterrockgruppe Technobats in ihre Stücke aufnimmt (I love Techno UNPLUGGED!!!)und sich viel zu wenig mit den Texten auseinandergesetzt hat.  Ich will die CD nicht schlechtreden, aber mir geht sie zu sehr in richtung Komerz- schnell produziert, Texte die man nach 2x hören schon auswendig kann, kein Titel mit dem man irgendjemand zunahe kommt, oder jemanden Verärgert.  Auf dem letzten Konzert wurde diese Meinung bestätigt. Viele neue Besucher waren von den ""alten"" Titeln, wegen der Geschwindichkeit und den Texten, geschockt.  Subway, besinnt euch auf eure Wurzeln!!!"
5,"Wow!! Evanescence bescherten uns ja schon mit ""Bring me to Life"" einen echten Megahit und brachten den Gothic-Metal wieder in die Charts, allerdings mit einer tollen starken Frauenstimme. NUn kommt die Nachfolgesingle ""Going Under"" und verspricht ein weiterer Knaller zu werden, besonders den Anfang des Song sfinde ich genial, der Refrain ist dann fast nicht zu toppen. Was soll man noch dazu sagen, dass dieser Song einfach nur mehr geil ist!!!"
5,"Das erste Album der Schweden-Rocker. Fetziger Sound und knallige Lieder, die zum Teil auch auf der "" From demos to Demoms "" sind. Nichts desto trotz rocken die Babies.  Wer das letzte Studioalbum ( Making Enemies is Good ) gemocht hat, der wird auch an dieser Scheibe seine wahre Freude haben. Achtung : Nichts für Kuschelrocker... die Jungs hier gehen ab."
1,"Es tut mir Leid, ich weiss nicht, warum diese Band aus aller Munde so hoch gelobt wurde, ich habe die CD mehrmals durchspielen lassen, das ist höchstlangweiliger Emo, kein Song besitzt eine Hookline, die im Ohr hängen bleibt, kein Song animiert zum Tanzen, die ganze Platte ist so ermüdend, dass sich mein Gehört nach einigen Minuten selbst auf Stanbye stellt. Aus meiner Sicht ein Griff ins Klo."
5,"aber auch sonst - diese Scheibe von Mercury Rev den alten Kollegen von den Flaming Lips, kann man sich eigentlich immer anhören. Es ist ein eher besinnliches fast meditatives Album - plus einer schönen Kante Rock, Experiment, natürlich Psychedelic und mit ordentlich Bombast. Jedenfalls fährt hier offenbar ein ganzes Orchester unterschiedlicher Instrumente und Einspielungen auf. Ich kenne das Album schon länger und es ist mir bisher nie auf die Nerven gegangen, was glaube ich ein echtes Kunstsück bei oben angedeuteter Melange sein dürfte..na gut - A Drop in Time ist vielleicht ein bißchen kitschig.. Meine Anspieltipps: The Dark is Rising, Tides of the Moon und Little Rhymes - ach, hört euch gleich das ganze Album an..."
1,"schaffen es einige Bands nach einem furiosen Debut-Album nicht mehr etwas ähnliches zustande zu bringen. Nonpoint erinnern mich hier sehr an Papa Roach oder Nickelback. Nach einem super Debut (Statement) kommt das Zweitwerk (Development), und man kann nur sagen: niederschmetternd schlecht. So was ödes und gesichtsloses hab ich seit der 2. Papa Roach, allen nachfolgenden Nickelback, Distrubed und was es sonst noch an Abstürzen dieser Art gibt,nicht mehr gehört. Dabei war kein Grund für eine  Veränderung ihrer Musik vorhanden, es hätte gereicht das Niveau zu halten (wie z.B. Linkin Park). Schade, denn Statement war echt der Hammer, ein Schädelfetzer aller erster Güte. Kann man nur hoffen, daß das so eben erschienene 3. Album wieder an die Form des 1. anschließt."
5,"Schon bevor Edita Gruberova von den leichten Koloraturpartien ins Belcanto-Fach wechselte hatte sie Operngeschichte geschrieben: mit ihrer Lucia, ihrer Königin der Nacht und vor allem ihrer Zerbinetta. Wer hätte gedacht, daß ihre vielleicht größte Rollen-Schöpfung noch folgen würde? Als Königin Elisabeth in Donizettis Oper ""Roberto Devereux"" verbindet Edita Gruberova höchste Gesangskunst mit der Darstellung einer betrogenen, einsamen Königin. Von ihren Belcanto-Partien ist dies auf jedenfall ihre größte Leistung. Hier läßt sie alle Kolleginnen, die diese Partie gesungen haben, weit hinter sich."
4,"XYZ kann man grob gesagt schon in die BON JOVI -Ecke einordnen, jedoch mit dem Unterschied dass hier die Gitarren noch Dampf machen dürfen, und alles schön knackig und kraftvoll um die Ecke kommt! Mit Terry Ilous hat man zudem einen Mann am Mikro, der auf ganzer Linie überzeugt, und den hochmelodischen und anspruchsvollen Songs seinen eigenen Stempel aufdrücken kann!  Die Band aus dem L.A. Stadtteil Hollywood schaffte einst den Sprung von den kleinen Clubs auf die grossen Bühnen der USA, was keineswegs verwundert. Denn man kann locker mit den hierzulande wohl bekannteren Grössen wie RATT oder POISON mithalten. Als Anspieltipps nenne ich mal das famose ""Touch The Sky"", den Ohrwurm ""Burn It Up"" sowie das mit einem Hammer-Refrain &amp; starkem Gitarrenspiel von J.K. Northrup beeindruckende ""Tango"", welches seinem Titel zum Glück in keinster Weise gerecht wird. Natürlich werden auch die Anhänger von Rock-Balladen mit Songs der Marke ""All I Asking"" glänzend bedient, so das man zum Schluss kommt das kein Melodic Rock Fan an dieser tollen Scheibe vorbei kommt. Starke Leistung, meine Herren!"
5,Ein super Album. Tolle Melodien. Gute Texte. Unbedingt kaufen. Sicher eines der besten deutschsprachigen Alben.
5,"Nachdem ich Zelenka nur durch die mehrteilige Serie in SWR2 kennengelernt habe, bin ich von dieser virtuosen Aufnahme begeistert. Um  Herrn Wenzel noch etwas hinzuzufügen bleibt nur zu sagen, dass diese Aufnahme auch klangtechnisch äußerst hochwertig  ist. Sie gehört insgesamt zu den Aufnahmen die man gehört haben sollte!"
1,"Tja, da braucht man sich nun wirklich nicht wundern! Schwache Verkaufszahlen, die bestensfalls 3 Wochen Top 100 sichern- Das ist besonders für die Plattenfirma bedauernswert. Aber man sollte halt vorher sich von den ""Künstlern"" überzeugen, die meinen mit Krach Geld verdienen zu wollen. Das Album ist eine einzige Katastrophe!!"
4,"Es ist erstaunlich wie sehr sich die Geister bei diesem Album scheiden. ""Bleed Like Me"" wurde von der einen Seite als ""reifste und intensivste"" Arbeit in den Himmel gelobt, andere stampften es in den Boden und meinten, die Band wäre endgültig in die ""Ideenlosigkeit"" abgedriftet und zu einer ""konventionellen Rockband"" geworden. Und dann gab es noch diejenigen, denen das Album so ziemlich egal war. Denn - wer hätte noch gedacht, dass es diese Band überhaupt noch mal schafft: ""Schön, dass es sie noch gibt."" Klingt etwas bemitleidenswert, doch das Quartett selbst sind sich darüber im klaren, dass es eigentlich erstaunlich ist, dass sie nach all den Pannen und Beinahe-Trennungen wieder zusammengefunden haben um eine neue CD aufzunehmen."
1,"Als ich von dieser recht neu erschienenen dritten Klaus Nomi-CD hörte habe ich nicht lange gezögert, und sie gleich gekauft. Das hätte ich besser gelassen... Im Gegensatz zu den beiden anderen Platten von ihm (""Klaus Nomi"" und ""Simple Man"") wo auf fast allen Stücken Klaus Nomis ""überirdischer"" Gesang zu hören ist, handelt es sich hier bestenfalls um Fragmente. Auf lediglich drei Stücken ist überhaupt so etwas wie Text oder Gesang zu erkennen, beim Rest sind lediglich Vokalisen (a-a-a-a-a-ahhhh) - und das auch noch ziemlich von der nichtssagenden Musik zugekleistert - zu hören. Für Nomi-Sammler zur Vervollständigung der Sammlung vielleicht ok, sonst besser zu den beiden Original-Alben (die ja auch noch zu seinen Lebzeiten erschienen sind) greifen."
5,"ständig wird auf Kraftwerk rumgeritten, als ob Hütter/Schneider ein Abo darauf haben, ständig etwas innovatives oder eine Blaupause für irgendetwas zu erfinden. Dabei machen die Herrschaften doch nur das, was sie schon seit immer machen. Nämlich ihre eigene musik."
1,"Ich hab nicht schlecht gestaunt als ich sah, was da am 21.10.05 rauskommen soll, aber sind wir doch einmal ehrlich: Das ist doch alles nur Geldmacherei. Wer ein Die Ärzte-Fan ist, hat die CD oder LP ""Debil"" sowieso schon und auch die Bonustracks sind ja wohl n Witz."
5,"King's X aus Texas sind eine der am wenigsten beachteten, aber herausragensten Rockbands im gesamten Business, und das schon seit fast 20 Jahren. Der große Erfolg ist für sie bisher ausgeblieben. Völlig zu Unrecht und unverständlich wie ich meine. Das beweist auch ihre neue CD Ogre Tones. Die ersten 4 Titel Alone, Stay, Hurricane und Fly rechtfertigen schon alleine den Kauf dieser CD. Ich habe selten bei einer Rockplatte einen so starken Beginn gehört. Alone, Stay und Fly sind grandiose Rocksongs voller Groove, Melodie und spieltechnischer Klasse. Hurricane ist wahrscheinlich der beste Rocksong der Band, der sich an die Beatles anlehnt. Diese Stücke enthalten alle herausragenden Merkmale der Band, aber noch nie waren sie in solch kompakter Form zu hören. King's X rocken und grooven wahnsinnig gut. Dazu kommen noch sehr schöne Melodien, und perfekter Harmoniegesang. Das alles gepaart mit musikalischer Perfektion, wobei immer wieder der Gitarrist Ty Tabor auffällt. Jimmy Page war der König der Gitarrenriffs in den 60er und 70er Jahren. Ty Tabor ist in meinen Augen der würdige Nachfolger. Nach den ersten 4 Titeln fällt das Niveau der Platte etwas ab, und die Stücke werden wieder komplexer. Die Klasse bleibt aber nach wie vor sehr hoch. Eine sehr schöne Ballade ist mit Honesty auch darunter. Nur der letzte Titel BAM bleibt überflüssig. Verglichen mit den älteren Platten der Band fällt auf, daß diese Platte sehr entspannt, rund und homogen wirkt. Sicher hat dazu auch der renommierte Producer Michael Wagener beigetragen. Vielleicht war er auch für die kleinen Änderungen im Detail verantwortlich, die diese Platte zu den besten von King's X werden ließ. War auf den früheren Platten der beatlesähnliche Gesang bei den härteren Rocksongs etwas widersprüchlich und unpassend, so fügt er sich auf dieser Platte perfekt in die härteren Songs ein. Manchmal waren die Songs in der Vergangenheit auch zu komplex. Solch kompakte Rocksongs wie die ersten 4 auf dieser CD sind bisher sehr selten bei King's X zu hören gewesen. Ogre Tones zähle ich persönlich zu den besten Platten, die King's X jemals gemacht hat, und sie hätte viel mehr verdient, als nur ein Geheimtip zu bleiben. Vielleicht kommt ja mit dieser CD endlich der verdiente Erfolg für die Band."
5,"SOLID STEEL PRESENTS BONOBO - It Came From The Sea"" Ninja Tunes Solid Steel-Serie geht in die siebte Runde. Nach dem für Teil sechs mit DJ Kentaro noch ein japanischer Legionär verpflichtet wurde, tritt mit Simon Green aka BONOBO nun wieder ein Brite an, der Welt den Groove zu lehren. An Lehrmaterial fehlt es hier beileibe nicht: Zwanzig Tracks werden in der eine Stunde dauernden Lektion gepflegter Party-Beschallung verbraten. Unnötig zu sagen, daß Green, der man aus der Seestadt Brighton, ein glückliches Händchen beweist und mixingtechnisch eine mehr als gute Figur macht. Schwere Drums und zuckersüße Melodien sind die Hauptbestandteile, das Gesamtwerk klingt wie eine angenehm kontinentaleuropäische Antwort auf die nimmer enden wollende Reihe von exzessiv weichgespülten Chill out-Compilations. Zugegebenermaßen, auch auf It Came From The Sea"" finden relaxte Sounds in großer Zahl ihren Platz, doch werden diese hier mit durchaus bissfesten Rhythmen unterfüttert. Bei der Trackwahl beweist man Freude an Diversität und so bleibt dann auch im weiten Feld zwischen Bossa und Funk bleibt kaum ein Genre unbedacht: Two Step-Breaks und Ragga-Vocals wechseln sich mit gediegenen Gitarrenakkorden mit massivem Drum-Unterbau ab, Jazz-Fragmente verlieren sich in kubanischen Klängen - Hauptsache die Wirkung auf Beine und Kopf stimmt und der Groove-Faktor bleibt gewahrt. Verwunderlich nur, daß die CD im Veröffentlichungskalender des Labels nicht vorne gezogen wurde, wäre It Came From The Sea"" doch zweifelsohne der Soundtrack für den Sommer 2005 gewesen. So wird BONOBO nun eben das triste bundesdeutsche Spätjahr mit etwas Brighton-Flavour"" bereichern."
2,"Ist wirklich schade wie Whitney auf diese Album klingt leider hat die beste Sängerin alle Zeiten ihre Stimme verloren und sehr wahrscheinlich braucht sie Geld das sie so ein schrott Album raus bringt Schade,Schade,Schade sie war mein Grösste Idol, ich werde weiter ihre alte Lieder hören und da bleiben."
5,"mal ganz ehrlich: manchmal braucht man jemanden, der mit gewissen musikalischen Entdeckungen solange auf einen einredet, dass man sich auch mal die Zeit nimmt was neues zu hören.... Mir ging es so, und ich traf auf Christina Lux und zähle mich nun zu eben jenen Kämpfern für die gute Sache. Die Sache in diesem Fall Frau Christina Lux! Nicht oft bringt Musik eine Seite zum Schwingen, auf der man sich wohlig getragen fühlt und in die man sich fallen lassen kann auf das es warm ums Herz wird...  Die Musik der Christina Lux ist mir mittlerweile eine gute Freundin geworden und zählt zu meinen Lieblingsschätzen! Danke dafür, dass jemand nicht aufgegeben hat. Für Freunde von Lizz Wright, Joy Denalane, Cassandra Wilson, Lisa Bassenge, etc..."
5,"Frischen Post-Punk braucht das Land! [...] Allerdings ist es bei der breiten Masse an neu aufkommenden Bands zunehmend schwieriger wirkliche Neuheiten herauszufiltern. Genau eine solche Band ist ""Infadels"" aber. Schon der der Titel des Albums, in welchem sie bewusst darauf hinweisen, dass sie nicht ""THE Infadels"" sind zeigt, dass sie sich bewusst abheben möchten. So ist es dann auch wenn man ihre Musik das erste Mal hört: Stimmiger Elektro Rock'n'Roll mit reihenweise verzerrten Basslines, der einfach nur zum Tanzen einlädt. Dennoch werden in den Liedern aber auch ernste Themen, wie z.B. in ""Reality TV"", die Abhängigkeit von einer Reality Sendung à la 'Big Brother', angesprochen. Fazit: Wer auf der Suche nach sehr gut tanzbarem Indie-Rock untermalt durch ein wenig Electro ist, ist bei dieser CD genau an der richtigen Adresse Anspieltipps: Can't get enough, Topboy"
2,"Obwohl ich Fan von Indochine bin, muss ich diesem Album die Empfehlung absprechen. Es ist zu laut gemastert (Stichwort: loudness war), wodurch der Lautstärkepegel ständig am oberen Ende ist. Dadurch kommt bei mir kein Genuss auf, sondern Kopfschmerzen."
2,"Dies vorweg: ich bin Fan von Indochine. Die Stücke auf dem Album sind in der Komposition durchaus gelungen, aber das Mastering ist katastrophal, daher nur 2 Punkte. Die CD ist zu laut: Stichwort loudness war. Der Pegel ist ununterbrochen am oberen Ende. So macht Musikhören keinen Spaß, sondern bereitet nur Kopfschmerzen! Daher: Finger weg. Falls eine Live-DVD kommt, werde ich mir diese gerne zulegen, aber dieses Album ist keine Empfehlung für Musikgenisser."
1,"Die Nr. 50 der Bravo-Hit-Reihe kommt nach Nr. 49. Warum da einige Rezensenten ein Jubiläum hineininterpretieren, ist mir ein Rätsel. Die Ausgabe schließt sich nahtlos an ihrer Vorgänger an: zwei bis drei Titel sind gut bis sehr gut, den Rest kann man vergessen - es sei denn, man ist ein Freak von Techno, House, Hip Hop, RhythmnBlues und Heavy Metal, die auf CD1 dominieren oder von Schunkelschlagern (altbekannte wie Amarillo und neue) und NDW- Balladen, die sich auf CD2 häufen. Mit Pophits hat das nicht mehr viel zu tun, und ich kann mir auch nicht vorstellen, dass es viele Leute gibt, denen alle diese Stile gleich gut gefallen. Die einzigen Lichtblicke in diesem 08/15-Einerlei sind für mich Loona mit ""Oye el boom"" und Groove Coverage mit ""Holy Virgin"" (obwohl die EAV kürzlich selbst eine weitaus groovigere Version ihres Originals produziert hat). Die Produzenten sollten entweder die Auswahl endlich in Richtung echte Hits ändern, oder den Serientitel ändern: Von jedem ein bisschen, aber nicht das Beste!"
5,"Ich habe die CD gekauft weil ich die Songs (...Lonely,Bad day ... usw) auf der CD kenne und haben möchte. Also von dieser Zusammenstellung bin ich begeistert.Da sind die Sommerhits drauf die bestimmt jeder mal gehört hat."
1,"Wir hatten uns schon sehr auf die neue Bravo Hits gefreut aber was wir dann hörten war sehr schlecht und entäuschend. Die 2. CD kann man eigentlich bis auf 2 Songs direkt in die Tonne schmeißen. Echt grass. Ein dickes ""Minus"" für diese CD und für die Bravo Redaktion die diese CD zusammengestellt hat."
4,"Eigentlich ist es ja ein verbrauchtes Image, das sich Kelis da auferlegte. Dragonerweib. Radau-Girlie. Recht langweilig, die ganze Sache. In ihrem Fall aber dennoch erträglich, mimt sie ihre Rolle auf ""Kaleidoscope"" - der musikalischen Defloration von 1999 - fast durchgängig hingebungsvoll. Bereits in ""Caught out there"" mutiert Kelis wie befürchtet zur Kampf-Emanze und heizt ihrem verflossenen Liebhaber kräftig ein. Für ""Mafia"" muss sie dann erstmal einen Gang zurückschalten - natürlich ohne je ihre herrische Position aufzugeben. ""The Love I have for you is like a Mafia"" singt sie wie im Rausch über eine beinah plakative Geräuschkulisse. Und es klingt wie Drohung und Verführung zugleich. Emotionslos und doch voll unterschwelliger Leidenschaft. Täter und Opfer in einer Person. Unwiderstehlich. Was man allerdings nicht von allem behaupten kann, das sich dem ""Kaleidoscope""-Konsumenten auftut. Bei zwei heftigen Fehltritten reduziert sich Kelis leider zur Epigone pensionsreifer Soul-Matronen a là Whitney Houston und Mariah Carey: Das kitschige ""Ghetto Children"" und das pathetische ""Wouldn't you agree"" überdecken zwölf gute Songs wie zäher Karamell - süß und ungemein klebrig. Lediglich dank Kelis' herrlich schwarzer Stimme und dem größtenteils ungeschliffenen, genuinen R'n'B, entgeht man gerade noch dem Zuckerschock. Aber knapp."
5,hiphop für den hosenmatz... eine unqualifiziertere bewertung für ein fantastisches album hab ich selten gehört bzw. gelesen.
5,"...wie viele andere def Jux Releases...Can O'- The Cold Vein ist unserer Zeit sooo weit voraus, dass man meinen könnte, die Musik kommt aus der Zukunft und gibt uns einen Vorgeschmack darauf, was in den nächsten (100?) Jahren dann so gehört wird... futuristisch klingen die Wahnsinnsproduktionen von El-p ja auch... aber auch schlichtweg...surreal...urbaner Alptraum...irgendwie doch aufm Erdboden...auf einer Bewusstseinsebene, die ich nicht zu beschreiben vermag...aber...so geht es mir auch mit Aesop Rocks ""Labor Days""...wenn ich diese musik höre und bspw. Natur an mir vorbeiziehen sehe, dann hievt die Musik meinen verstand irgendwie ne Ebene höher, man sieht die Dinge dann etwas anders... dieser Effekt stellt sich besonders bei ""Pigeon"" ein...auf eine gewisse Art und Weise ein schlichtweg schöner Track... Sonst ist die Musik eher recht düster hegalten und nutzt dabei hin und wieder mal Zitate aus Animes/Mangas, so z.B. im Hook von dem genialen Opener ""iron Galaxy""...auch dieses schreckliche, grollende ""Uuhhhhh!"" aus dem Lied ""Ox out of the Cage"" (dieses Geräusch lässt einem das Blut in den Adern gefrieren) könnte durchaus aus dem Film ""Akira"" stammen...Höllentrack im positiven Sinne... ok, zugegeben, die Musik ist ARG gewöhnungsbedürftig und erfordert ne Menge Offenheit (*seufz* wie vieles von Def Jux), sollte man diese haben erwartet einem HipHop wie man ihn vorher nie gehört hat! Bitte kaufen, wenn man meint, man wäre bereit dazu, mit diesen Leuten neue wege zu beschreiten! =)"
1,"hallo, eine einzige enttäuschung diese DVD. auf dem cover steht DTS, leider findet sich aber keine DTS-spur auf der scheibe. das ist betrug. das ständige gelaber und getue zwischen den songs ist extrem nervend. die musik und die show sind ein witz, ich bin mehrfach eingeschlafen. wo bleiben hier die fetten beats? der sub-woofer hat hier kaum was zu tun. absolut keine empfehlung."
5,"Einfach genial, was Joseph Hill und seine Truppe Ende der 70'er eingespielt haben. Die Soundqualität meiner alten LP lässt sehr zu wünschen übrig, deshalb ist die CD auf jeden Fall ein Glücksgriff gewesen. Super Qualität !!! Alle Songs sind klasse, herausstellen würde ich im Moment vielleicht ""Payday"" und ""This Train"". Letzteres ist auf Jamaika immer noch ein beliebter Evergreen... Kann ich nur empfehlen ! Jah Live"
1,"Das ist kein Dynamite Deluxe Album!! Das ist nur ein weiteres belangloses Samy Deluxe Album!!! Keine Spur von Dynamite Deluxe. Niemand hat wirklich das Aufwärmen der ollen ""Deluxe Soundsystem"" Kamellen erwartet. Aber das Niveau wurde nicht annähernd erreicht. Nur der zweite Track ""Newcomer des Jahres"" zeigt etwas von der alten Stärke. Dieses Album wird sich bestimmt unglaublich gut verkaufen passt sich aber leider dem aktuellen Niveau des deutschen HipHops an. Unnötig! Enttäuschend! Erwartungen NICHT erfüllt! Das einzige positive an diesem Album ist wohl die geringe Spielzeit von ungefähr 44 Minuten. Die wird das Trio wohl dazu zwingen auf ihren Konzerten ein paar der Klassiker anzustimmen."
5,"...mit einem wahnsinnig, gutem Debütalbum. Der neueste Künstler aus dem Hause Shady Records hat seine CD veröffentlicht und auf dieser sind einige namenhafte Künstler als Gaststars vertreten. (Nate Dogg, Eminem, 50 Cent, Dr. Dre, D12, Busta Rhymes) Eminem ist gleich auf mehreren Songs zu hören, was Eminem Fans sehr erfreuen würde. Absolute Höhepunkte der CD sind Lady, Got some Teeth(das übrigens auch seine aktuelle Single ist), Don't come down und das Outro. Wie immer eine super CD von Shady Records, die in keiner Hip Hop Sammlung fehlen sollte."
1,"Auch wenn ich meinen Worten hier nur eine geringe Halbwertzeit zutraue, möchte ich doch meiner verzweifelten Verwunderung darüber Ausdruck verleihen, wie auch nur irgend jemand diese Song-Placebos für echte Musik halten und diesen Domina-Gesang mit Gefühl in Zusammenhang bringen kann. Die Texte sind so authentisch wie Big Brother und so originell wie Ferrero-Werbung. Bei Frau R.s Stimme gefriert mir das Herz (wenn sich meine Ohren nicht rechtzeitig zuklappen) und bei diesen einfältigen Melodien wünsche ich mir Bohlen-Hits... Über den Keyboarder-Darsteller möchte ich nichts schlechtes sagen, er macht ja außer einem niedlichen Singversuch nix besonderes, oder? Und wer ist eigentlich diese Sanne, die da immer kommt? Ein besorgter Musikliebhaber"
1,Das müssen sich wohl die Songschreiber von Yvonne Catterfeld gedacht haben. Jedes Lied klingt gleich. Die stimme ist immer im selben Ton und verliert sich rasend schnell in der Monotonie. Texte werden mit niedersten Inhalten gefüllt. wozu sollte man ein Thema wählen über das die Fans wirklich nachdenken müssen. viel zu kompliziert. Bleiben wir lieber bei den simplen und gleichen Songstrukturen. das zieht sich hier durch alle Lieder. auch wenn Frau Catterfeld eine gute Sängerin ist kann sie das vorgelegte nicht umsetzen und ins gute ziehen. Producer und Sängerin haben gut zusammen gearbeitet und eine CD vollbracht die so wohl keiner benötigt hätte.Danke für nichts.
1,"Das dachte sich wohl auch Jeanette B. als sie diesen Song machte. Dreister kann man Musik schon gar nicht mehr kopieren. Der Song klingt von vorne bis hinten nach dem alten Roxette Klassiker ""The Look"". Ob das beabsichtigt war oder nicht ist egal. Der Song kommt weder stimmlich noch musikalisch an das Original heran und ist nur ein weiteres Beispiel dafür, wie langweilig und einfallslos die heutige Chartsmusik geworden ist. Da wird lieber kopiert als eigene Ideen zu entwickeln."
5,"Ich habe vor einigen Tagen diese Doppel - CD erworben und bin völlig begeistert. Die Autumn musiziert in einer eigenen Liga - technisch sowieso, aber genauso lyrisch, kompositorisch und auch im Stil der Präsentation. Mozart im neuen Jahrtausend ist eine Frau. Er selbst würde ihr sicher zu Füßen liegen! Power pur! Neue Musik vom Feinsten, ich hatte das Gefühl, in jeder Nummer steckt die Musikgeschichte. Alle Titel dieser Ausgabe sind zahllose  Wiederholungen wert, bei denen man stets Neues entdeckt. Phantastisch! Die musikaische Qualität ist von der Art, dass man die Distanz zu den aktuellem Mitbewerbern am Musikmarkt auch als Laie merkt.Um anderen nachher gerne zuhören zu können, ist zunächst eine Pause fällig, sonst wird man ungerecht. Absolut empfehlenswert, hoffentlich gibt es bald auch eine DVD, diese Künstlerin ist ein ""Gesamtkunstwerk"", das streng genommen auch den Sehsinn verlangen würde. Bis dahin fasziniert die Doppel-CD mit gelungenem Beiheft und Poster, fast ein Schulbeispiel für modernes Marketing, voll und ganz."
1,"Bei aller Sperrigkeit und Unkonventionalität hat die Band leider vergessen, was einen guten Song ausmacht. Die Scheibe klingt verkrampft, als wolle man unbedingt jede Melodiösität vermeiden. Statt den Hörer bei den Eiern zu packen und loszurocken wird dessen Ohr mit Dissonanzen malträtiert. Versteht mich nicht falsch, ich habe kein Problem mit Noise (die neue Ulme ist wunderbar!) aber das hier ist einfach uninspiriert und nervtötend. Hoffentlich ist diese ""Era"" bald Geschichte."
5,"Definitiv zur ersten NWOBHM Liga gehörten Diamond Head, für deren überragende musikalische Qualität Sänger Sean Harris und Gitarrist Brian Tatler bürgten. Sean Harris sang bereits damals wie ein junger Gott (nicht selten wurde man an Robert Plant erinnert) und Brian Tatler schrieb Riffs die so eingängig wie unwiderstehlich waren. Die Band pflegte einen einzigartigen Stil, der mit keiner anderen Band (innerhalb wie außerhalb der Bewegung) vergleichbar war, wohl aber viele andere inspiriert hatte. Vom Härtegrad war man oft näher an Bands wie Thin Lizzy als an, na sagen wir Judas Priest, aber Songs wie Am I Evil? oder Lightning to the Nations rockten mit einer ungestümen Vehemenz, von der sich noch heute so manche Schwermetall Truppe eine dicke Scheibe abschneiden könnte. Um es auf den Punkt zu bringen: die Jungs setzten eine Menge Energie frei! Dieses re-release ist vorbildlich umgesetzt worden, so dass ich an dieser Stelle weder vor der Höchstnote, noch vor einer uneingeschränkten Kaufempfehlung zurückschrecke..."
5,"Ehrlich Gesagt haben mich die Sprotfreunde Stiller nie wirklich gekümmert. Ok, sie hatten ab und an mal ganz gute lieder. Nun hab ich vor ein paar Tage in die CD reingehört. Und ich muss sagen die CD ist nicht schlecht. Die Sportfreunde sind gar nicht so soft, wie ich es von vielen ihrer netten hits erwartet hatte, sondern bringen richtig schwung mit. Klar gibt es auch ruhigere Titel. Viele der Lieder errinnern am anfang ein wenig an gute Ärzte songs, ohne diese kopiert zu haben oder als nachmache zu klingen. Favoriten sind definitiv ""Frühling"" und ""Andere Mütter""."
2,"Zuerst die Freunde eine neue Vivaldioper mit Starbesetzung, dann aber beim 1 hören die Riesenenttäuschung ob des viel zu knalligen und poppigen Musizierens. Leider versteht es der Dirigent nicht die Schönheiten zu betonen sondern setzt immer noch eines drauf mit zu knalligen zu sehr forte/piano Effekten die so sicherlich nicht gewollt waren. Nichts gegen eine modernere, frischere und entstaubte Vivaldideutung, aber dermaßen ver""poppt"" macht das keine Sinn. Das Krasseste Beispiel die Arie der Damira "" Vorrei danch io"" in der herrlichen Stimme von N. Stutzmann kommt hier leider nie richtig zum tragen weil einfach zu heftig musiziert wird, das geht auch anders! Im Gegensatz zur Olimpia ein Riesenschritt zurück, und zum Farnace ein Kilometer dahinter. Dennoch Freude das es endlich mal in Angriff genommen wird diese seltenen Werke einzuspielen."
1,"wie tief ist die Erfolgsgeschichte ""Dream Dance"" gesunken!? Wer noch im Besitz der ersten Dream Dance CDs ist, wird wissen wovon ich rede. Auch Vol. 31 besteht wieder aus viel proletenhaftem Rumgegröle, schlechten Coverversionen und stumpfsinnigem Rumgehämmere mit grausamen ""Singsang"". Ausnahmen gibt es wenige. ....und so kommt es, dass alte Größen wie ""Jens"" wieder ausgegraben werden und prommt mit einem Remake von ""Loops &amp; Tings"" als erster Titel der CD2 plaziert werden. Insegesamt eine eher enttäuschende CD. Wer nicht schon eine große Sammlung Dream Dance CDs hat, sollte auf andere CD-Compilations umsteigen."
1,"...diese CD ist nach meiner Meinung nicht gelungen. Eine totale Rückentwicklung... wo kommen die Lieder her ? Die Texte sowie die Melodien - nichts aufregendes.Keine wichtige Themen werden angesprochen. Kommt an den vergangenen, wunderschönen Alben nicht ran. Schade. Bin das erste Mal enttäuscht. Hoffe auf das nächste Album, dann vielleicht wieder tiefsinnige, mystische, aufregende, aus dem Leben gegriffene Texte."
1,"Die anderen Lieder und Videos von ""Tokio Hotel"" sind sehr gelungen, aber das ""Schrei""-Video ist sehr unpassend und kein gutes Vorbild für die Fans."
1,"Chipz und Banaroo sind so ziemlich mit die ätzendsten Bands des Universums. Ich meine, die können keine Instrumente spielen, die singen mies, alle Songs klingen gleich. Eine wirklich alberne Band deren infantile Melodien und Texte höchstens Kleinkinder ansprechen."
2,"Dies ist meine zweite CD von Jewel (erste war 'This way') und ich muss schon sagen, dass ich sehr enttäuscht bin!!! Jetzt macht sie auch 08/15 Pop, so hätte sie diese CD wahrscheinlich eher nennen müssen! Bei 'This way' überzeugt sie mit super Texten und Gitarrenmelodien, die ins Ohr gehen! Davon hört man auf der aktuellen Scheibe nichts mehr, auch textlich ist dieses Album schwächer geworden! Jewel scheint wohl schwer verliebt zu sein, was man manchen Texten schwer anmerkt, es gibt anscheinend für sie im Moment nur noch Liebe als Thema, leider nicht sehr überzeugend für Fans! Schade, schade...."
5,"Wunderbarer anspruchsvoller Sound...im Auto oder auf der Couch, Musik ohne Verfallsdatum...immerwieder neue Klänge, nie langweilig... Einfach Klasse!"
5,Die CD ist zum zuhören &amp; genießen! Der Sound ist einmalig! Nix für nebenher.....das ist großes KINO!
2,"Die Messlatte war hoch, die persönlichen Erwartungen höher - um so tiefer war der Fall. Ohrwürmer wie ""Karma"" oder ""When the lights are down"" fehlen komplett. Der beste Song der Platte erreicht nur Mittelmaß und wäre auf den Vorgängeralben neben der hohen Qualität der Songs unter gegangen. Ähnlich steht es um die neue CD von Sonata Arctica ""Unia"". Es scheint ein derzeitiges Phänomen zu sein, das die großartige Bands versuchen ihren Stil zu ändern.  Aber nach wie vor reden wir hier über Kamelot und meckern auf einem hohen Niveau. Ich persönlich wurde von der Platte sehr enttäuscht."
5,"Die 25-jährige Kolumbianerin Shakira mauserte sich innerhalb von nur vier Monaten vom Insider-Tipp zur Pop-Ikone. Die zweite Singleauskopplung aus ihrem Top-Album ""Laundry Service"" ist eine gefühlvolle Midtempo-Ballade, die besonders Männerherzen zum schmelzen bringt. :)) Ganz anders als ""Whenever, Wherever"", aber auch super gut gelungen. Diese Scheibe ist ein echter Geheimtipp!!"
1,"Beim aufmerksamen Zuhören wird klar, das sich hinter Shakira auch nur ein gepushtes Sternchen verbirgt. Vor allem eines fehlt dieser Frau: Sängerische Klasse. Auf der einen Seite ist es mutig, das sie sich an ein solches Stück traut, welches doch über einen größeren Stimmumfang geht - allerdings hört man deutlich, das sie eben diesen nicht besitzt. Die Mittellage hört sich gut an - wie man es aus den anderen Songs kennt, jedoch die Höhen und Tiefen sind einfach nur heraus gequält. Man hätte diesen schönen Song durch eine Sängerin interpretieren lassen sollen, die singen kann."
4,"Eaglesfan bin ich, seit es die gruppe gibt, mit 'Desperado' fing es an. Die CD ist perfect prodiúziert, man kann sie gut hören, dennoch sind eingängige Melodien, die einem nicht mehr aus dem Kopf gehen, kaum vorhanden. Ein wenig zu elektrisch, es fehlt einfach Don Felder. Live sind die Eagles absolute Spitze, aber die Genialität von Stücken wie Peaceful Easy Feeling, Desperado, Tequila Sunrise, Ol' '55, On the Border, One of These Nights, Hotel California, I Can't Tell You Why, Love Will Keep Us Alive usw. wird hier nicht erreicht !! Es hätte auch eine CD gerreicht."
1,"Diese zusammenstellung „kuscheliger"" electro-songs mit amateurhaften drum-arrangements und billigen synthie-geklimper (á la bontempi) kann ich bedenkenlos im beisein meiner kleinen kinder laufen lassen, wenn ich es denn noch hören wollte. Ehrlich, man sollte dem (ex-)meister und vielfachen idol der electro-szene doch mehr als dieses zweitklassige gestümper zutrauen dürfen, auch wenn der gute rudy ratzinger inzwischen - und das gestehe ich ihm uneingeschränkt zu - etwas ruhiger geworden sein möchte. Dann sollte er bei der cover-gestaltung aber evtl. variieren, denn glaubt man, hinter dem antlitz des bösen monsters auf dem cover auch ein monster in audio-form vorzufinden, täuscht man sich gewaltig. Ein teddybär hätte besser gepasst...."
5,"Bowie ist zurück mit einem anspruchsvollen, kurzweiligen Album das die Spannung auf die bevorstehende Tour noch mehr erhöht. Der limitierte Doppelpack ist uneingeschränkt empfehlenswert. Anspieltipps neben dem Titeltrack: ""Pablo Picasso"", ""The loneliest guy"" und nicht zuletzt das grandiose ""Bring Me The Disco King""."
2,"Seit heute habe ich die CD. Kaufentscheid waren eigentlich die zwei Titel ""The 7th Sign"" und vor allem ""Valediction"", der bei N24 ständig gespielt wird. Leider ist auf der CD nicht die Originalversion von N24 übernommen worden. Ganze Passagen wurden verändert eingespielt, schade! Die übrigen Titel weichen im Stil doch sehr von denen der ersten CD ab. Trotzdem bereue ich den Kauf nicht."
5,"Trotz den gewagten Rauswurf ihres Saengers Messiah, konnte Candlemass ein Album rausbringen welches den Verlust der Stimme voll kommen  vergessbar machte. Mit King of the Grey Islands ist Candlemass mal wieder ein Meisterwerk gelungen was in keiner Doom-Metal-Sammlung fehlen sollte"
5,"Lange Zeit mussten die Fans auf neues Material von Blind Guardian warten, doch nach Hören dieser Single wird klar: Das Warten hat sich gelohnt!!!"
5,"Nightfall in Middle Earth- ganz klar ein Meisterwerk, dass seinesgleichen sucht! Als großer Fan von Tolkiens Silmarilion hat das Erscheinen der CD mich besonders gefreut! Und ich muss sagen, es übertraf alle meine Erwartungen! Die Stimmungen des Buches werden perfekt wiedergegeben, in Nightfall spürt man die aus der Trauer entstehende Wut der Noldor, The Curse of Feanor zu hören ist wie das Buch zu lesen, und Noldor gibt perfekt die Traurigkeit des Schiksals der Noldor wieder! Dann folgt The Eldar! Schon jemandem, der das Buch nicht kennt, läuft hier eine Gänsehaut über den Rücken, doch ein Buchkenner wird hier von einer Traurigkeit erfüllt, als sei er dem toten Nom nahegestanden! Dazu kommen die bombastischen Time stands still, Thorn und A Dark Passage, die jeden Hörer mit einem unbeschreiblichen Gefühl erfüllen! Und um diese CD zu vollenden,sind auch schnelle Songs wie Into the Storm, Mirror Mirror und When Sorrow sang enthalten! Auch die Gesprächszenen sind verdammt gut geraten, vor allem Nom the Wise bedrückt mich jedesmal aufs neue! Ebenfalls beindruckend sind die kurzen Gesangsstücke The Minstrel und Out on the Water!Mein Tipp: KAUFEN KAUFEN KAUFEN!!!"
1,"Auch ich habe als eingefleischter Maffay-Fan auf neues Material gewartet. Besonders in den langsamen Songs ist aber die Kontinuität seiner früheren Alben nicht zu erkennen, vielmehr ein Stillstand auf weichgespültem Schlagerniveau zu verzeichnen. Nach langer Zeit ein Fehlkauf meinerseits."
5,"Blank &amp; Jones sind mit die einzigsten DJ's die es schaffen immer wieder Alben fertigzustellen, die ohne Coverversionen auskommen und die man sich immer wieder gern anhört. Für die Freunde der Dance - Scene eine echte Bereicherung"
2,"Es ist sicherlich ein redliches Anliegen, auch die Musik der einflussreichsten und besten Rockband aller Zeiten zu einer Best-of-Kompilation für den Gelegenheitshörer zusammenzustellen. Dennoch ist dieses Unterfangen im Falle von ""1"" gründlich misslungen. Niemand braucht dieses Album, die 2 Doppel-CDs ""Rotes"" und ""Blaues"" Album enthalten bereits die wichtigsten Songs der Band, nur mit der im Falle der Beatles gebotenen Ausführlichkeit, und das in einer durchaus liebevoll zusammengestellten Art und Weise. Dass da jetzt eine Ansammlung der Nr. 1-Hits hinterhergeschickt werden soll, erscheint nicht nur dem Beatles-Fan, der ohnehin bereits alle Songs kennt und im Plattenschrank hat, überflüssig, sondern es verstellt auch Neueinsteigern den Blick auf den Facettenreichtum der Band, indem wichtige Tracks, die nun einmal nicht per definitionem ""Nr. 1-Hits"" waren, ausgespart werden zugunsten einer merkwürdigen ""Höher-Weiter-Schneller-Besser""-Mentalität, die mit Musik überhaupt nichts mehr zu tun hat. Also: ""1"" ist reiner Kommerz, völlig überflüssig und zudem bedenklich in seiner sporttrophäenhaften Aufmachung. Niemand, der sich mit den Beatles beschäftigen will, braucht es. Wenn es irgendwie finanziell zu bewerkstelligen ist, sollte man sich ""Rot"" und ""Blau"" zu legen; da hat man für's erste alles wichtige beeinander, bei zunehmender Begeisterung kann dann die Auseinandersetzung mit den Studio-Alben folgen. Doch wer's unbedingt günstig und kompakt braucht und ohnehin ""nur mal reinhören"" möchte, soll sich, kann sich dann wenn es gar nicht anders geht auch ""1"" zulegen. Die Musik da drauf ist natürlich trotzdem überragend, aber darüber muss an dieser Stelle sicherlich nicht mehr debattiert werden."
5,"k. d. langs ""Hymns of the 49th Parallel"" erschien passend zum Herbst 2004 in einem matten Pappschuber, der die kühle Grundstimmung vom Cover untermalt. Die Künstlerin hat sich für ihr Werk etwas Besonderes ausgedacht: Eine Art ""Canadian Songbook"" mit elf Songs von einigen der größten Songwriter Kanadas, inklusive einer Eigenkomposition. Die Schönheit der Lieder spricht für sich, sind sie doch verfasst von Musik-Legenden wie Leonard Cohen, Joni Mitchell oder Neil Young (alle drei sind mit jeweils zwei Kompositionen vertreten). Weitere Titel stammen von Bruce Cockburn, Ron Sexsmith und Jane Sibery.  Die wunderschöne kraftvolle Stimme von k. d. lang verleiht allen Songs ihren ganz besonderen Reiz. Man nehme zum Beispiel die angesprochenen Lieder von Joni Mitchell, ""A Case of You"" und ""Jericho"". Begnadete Kompositionen, die im Original von Mitchells durchdringenden Sopran getragen werden. k. d. lang macht daraus eher rauchige Kaminfeuer-Oden, deren Zauber auch durch die erstklassigen Streicher-Arrangements von keinem geringeren als Eumir Deodato (""Also Sprach Zarathustra - Theme From 2001: A Space Odyssey"") getragen werden. Dessen Geschick zieht sich wie ein roter Faden durch das Album, ebenso wie das opulente Piano-Spiel von Teddy Borowiecki (vorher tätig für Elton John, Eddie Reader oder The Manhattan Transfer). Allerdings kommen auch Fans von akustischen Gitarren auf ihre Kosten, wie bei Leonard Cohens ""Bird on a Wire"". Ferner sollte ""Helpless"" von Neil Young Erwähnung finden, welches sich zu einer mitreißenden, wunderschönen Hymne aufschwingt."
5,"Der viel beschäftigte DJ Claude Challe (Buddha Bar u.a.) hat sich nach einem Treffen mit der neuen Emmanuelle Nastasja Vermeer (Film folgt) zu einer Zusammenstellung von Titeln bewegen lassen, die dem erotischen Klassiker auch musikalisch gerecht werden sollen. Vermeer hat zwei Songs zu diesem Sampler beigetragen, u.a. die Neueinspielung des Pierre Bachelet-Klassikers „Emmanuelle"". Ansonsten wird diese CD der Vorgabe gerecht, d.h. es sind schwelgende Melodien, sphärische Klänge, exotische Sounds und Vokal-Samples (eine Spezialität Challes) im Zeitlupentempo zu hören. Sehr lasziv das alles."
5,Ein wirklich geiles Teil ist diese CD geworden!
5,Klasse Musik von Peter Fox! Sehr sehr komische Musikrichtung die ich noch nie vorher gehört habe aber es ist einfach zu hören:) Kaufen Kaufen Kaufen!
4,"In der Tat, auch mich hat Hear in the now frontier negativ überrascht. Chris de Garmo wollte in eine andere musikalische Richtung gehen und hat dies auf dem Rücken dieser genialen Band ausgetragen. Dennoch QR ist nichts für normale Progressive-Rocker (z. B. wie Dream-Theater-, Savatage-, Fates Warning oder Shadow Gallery-Fans). Diese Band -gespickt mit Musikern aller erste Klasse- war schon immer die Alternative zur Alternative. Wer die Band nur wegen dem Jahrhundertalbum ""Operation Mindcrime"" oder dem für QR-Verhältnisse etwas kommerzielleren ""Empire"" mochte, weiß nicht, was den ""Spirit"" dieser Gruppe darstellt. Wer QR verstehen will, muss offen sein für neue Wege und muss Texte verstehen. Die Musik ist stets im Einklang mit den Lyrics zu sehen und bildet so eine Einheit. QR versucht sich immer weiterzuentwickeln, auch wenn das einigen sog. Fans überhaupt nicht passt, da sie was anderes erwarten. QR lässt sich jedoch nicht in eine Schublade pressen. QR macht stets Musik unabhängig von Kritiken. Diese Gruppe macht das, was sie machen möchte ohne auf Verkaufszahlen zu schielen (was andere zwangsläufig machen müssen, nicht zugeben und sich was vormachen). Diese Unabhängigkeit imponiert mir. QR war schon immer etwas Außergewöhnliches. Die einstigen Edel-Rocker sind älter geworden und haben mit der ""EP"" und ""The Warning"" überhaupt nichts mehr zu tun. Mir persönlich gefällt ""Promises Land"" am besten. Man muss halt alle Alben zuerst zehn bis zwanzig mal anhören, dann wirds allerdings immer besser. Wer dazu nicht bereit ist, für den ist QR nichts. Für mich ist diese Band schon immer etwas Besonderes gewesen. Andere haben die Entwicklung nicht verkraftet. So ist es halt, wer sich nicht verändert und immer nur seinen üblichen Progmetal will, der rafft QR nie. QR ist was für die Basics, für Menschen, die komplexere Strukturen bevorzugen, eine Band, mit der man sich beschäftigen muss. Am besten alle Alben kaufen und die positve Entwicklung nachvollziehen. QR ist zu perfekt um überhaupt eine schlechten Song zu liefern ! Wer zu ""When der rain comes"" sagt, dass dieser Song schlecht bzw. langweilig ist, der hat nichts verstanden, der muss die Finger von QR lassen. QR ist nichts für billige Hauptschulmetaller. Einen gewissen Intellekt muss man schon mitbringen. Bevor die Band ein Album veröffentlicht, weist man nie, was dabei rauskommt. Ich war von jedem Album überrascht und keine Neuveröffentlichung reizt so stark wie ein neues QR-Album. Jedes mal original-QR und doch anders als als alles andere !! Ich hoffe, diese Band bleibt den Leuten, die den ""selektiven Luxus"" in einer besonderen und Art und Weise bevorzugen, und nicht rosten und rasten, noch lange erhalten. Metal war QR noch nie. Die Band kann musikalisch fast nicht eingeordnet werden. Es handelt sich um Musik, die sich von der Masse wahrlich abhebt, aber nur das ist es, was reizt. Wer mit den 5 Jungs mal backstage geredet hat, der weiss, dass es sich um ganz normale Menschen handelt, überhaupt kein Star-Getuhe und nebenbei sind dies 5-Familienväter und excellente Musiker, die Ihr Handwerk in Perfektion verstehen. Got ryche ?"
1,"Nach den vielen ueberragenden Kritiken war ich ja kurz davor, mir diese CD zu bestellen, doch gerade noch rechtzeitig habe ich gesehen, dass man in die Platte 'reinhoeren kann... Ich habe es dann bei drei Liedern belassen,  denn ich kann mir nicht vorstellen, dass jemand, der diese Musik schon im  Original gehort hat, sich mehr als drei Lieder antun kann - afrikanische  Text unfallfrei ausprechen zu koennen langt nicht ganz... ABER, es geht  auch anders: Hoert Euch doch mal die Filmmmusik zu ""The Power of  One"" an, die in Zusammenarbeit zwischen Hans Zimmer und Johnny Clegg  (u.a.) enstanden ist."
5,"...das es noch solche gute Musik gibt. Die Rednecks der ABB haben wieder wirklich alles gegeben... und das lässt sich hören. Die stark blueslastige Southern-Rock Band hat mit ihrem Studioalbum ""Hittin' the Note"" wieder einen Volltreffer gelandet. Die Stücke gehen fast alle über 5 Minuten... also nichts mit Mainstream-Radio-""Musik"". Diese Musik lebt. Also Platte rein, Anlage aufdrehen und Spaß haben."
1,"Also ich muss ja mal sagen , ich hatte ja nichts gegen den sommerhit ""asereje"" aber ich find es schon peinlich , dass man ihn gleich 4 mal auf das album packen musste, daraus kann man sich sicher auch schließen , dass las ketchup nicht viel musikalisch drauf haben. ich find es schon ganz schön peinlich und es soll mir mal jemand einen künstler nennen der gleich 4 mal das gleiche lied auf ein album packt. und nebenbei erwähnt der rest des album ist auch nich grad so doll. die neue single ""Kusha las payas"" lädt wunderbar zum einschlafen ein und der rest ist einfach nur schrott. Fazit: Las ketchup sind wieder nur eine Gruppe die einen Sommer gesungen haben und dann nichts vernünftiges mehr zu stande gebracht haben. (auch one-hit-wonder genannt!). also ab in die tonne!! auf keinen fall kaufen! lieber das neue christina album oder jennifer lopez , da ist wenigstens qualität drin!"
5,"Meteora ist das einzige Album das ich besitze,von den ich alle Songs immer und immer wieder hören kann ,bis auf ""Session"" von diesem Song bekomme ich Kopfschmerzen.Auch wenn man mit diesem ALbum nur 13 Lieder ausgeliefert bekommt ist es ein empfehlenswehrtes Album ,das sich jeder ,egal ob HipHop-oder Rockfan kaufen sollte,denn dieses Album darf einfach in keinem CD-Turm fehlen."
2,"Ein einigermaßen gerechtes Urteil zu diesem Album abzugeben ist schwer. Das liegt daran, dass es teilweise ziemlich aggressiv klingt und auch viel andere DT-Alben zitiert werden. Wirklich gute Passagen sind vorhanden, aber in Spielminuten ausgedrückt sind es doch recht wenig, z.B. Titel 01 und 08 brauchen ca. 9 Minuten bis sie komplex werden, Titel 07 hat eine 7-Min.-Durststrecke. Auch die vielen Zitate, mal instrumental, mal per Text (""Hello Mirror, so glad to see you""), wirken einfallslos - eine Band die sich selbst so offensichtlich kopiert? Dazwischen mal flache Titel (02, 05) und einer, der in großen Teilen von einer anderen Band stammen könnte: 03. Es gibt mal eine knatternde Bassdrum, mal verfremdete Stimmen, was mir beides nicht gefällt. Das ganze Album ist sehr uneinheitlich. Ich sehe ein Album als eine ganze Einheit und das Durchhören von ""Systematic Chaos"" macht mir nur eingeschränkte Freude. Meiner Meinung nach ist es sogar schlechter als das nur durchschnittliche ""Octavarium"" - das ist dagegen schon Weichspüler, aber kopiert wenigstens nicht so stark vergangene Alben. ""Train of Thought"" ist zwar auch recht hart, insgesamt aber einheitlicher und deutlich besser durchzuhören. Die Bonus-DVD ist dank des soliden 5.1 Mixes zu empfehlen. Die Bedienung ist auf Dauer aber nervig: erst ""Roadrunner Records""-Logo, dann ""Systematic Chaos"" - überspringen verboten. Einmal Pfeil nach unten, Enter, nochmal Enter und dann gibt es erst die gewünschte Musik. Vor-/Zurückspulen ist verboten, keine Untertitel mit Songtexten und nette, aber statische Hintergrundbilder. Ich würde mir eine DVD wünschen, die nicht nervt und gleich loslegt, nicht erst eine halbe Minute später. DTS-Ton wäre fein, ist aber wohl nicht bei einer Bonus-DVD zu erwarten. Die Dokumentation ist ziemlich schlecht: zu viel Gelaber und das noch amateurhaft gefilmt."
5,"Da ist sie: Die neue Scheibe der ""The Busters"" und sie bietet eine Menge neues. Zunächst wäre da der neue 2te Sänger Ron Marsman der genau genommen in die Fußspuren des,bereits vor 3 Jahren ausgestiegenen,Sängers Markus Sprengler tritt. Somit sind die Busters wieder zu zwölft und besser als je zuvor. Bereits mit dem Opener ""Far Away"" betrteten die Busters,wie auch schon mit der Vorabsingle ""Radio Smash Hit"" musikalisches Neuland. Der etwas rockig-punkige Stil hat sich bisher nie richtig durchgesetzt und wird in diesen Songs zum ersten mal ""gewürdigt"". Ungewohnt aber gut. Abwechslungsreich geht es weiter mit dem entspannten ""Whiskey Til I Drop"",dem poppigen ""Clock´s Don´t Rock"" und dem traditionellen Off Beat Stück ""Bad Guys"". Eine etwas härtere Gangart schlagen die Busters wieder mit dem Stück "" Big Boy"" ein,welches auch Ska Core Ansätze besitzt. Zudem hat auch ein neues Instrumentalstück den Weg aufs Album gefunden. Ebenfalls ein sehr gutes Stück. Insgesamt muss man sagen,dass ""Evolution Pop"" wohl eines der besten Album der Jungs aus Wiesloch ist. Es ist abwechslungsreich,bietet viel neues und die beiden Sänger leisten sehr gute Arbeit. Neben ""360 Degree"" handelt es sich hier wohl um das beste Album der ""The Busters"".  Auf das viele weiter Alben dieser Art folgen!"
5,"Also ich mochte Green Day schon immer und U2 ist sowieso eine meiner Lieblingsbands. Und dieser Song ist der absolute Hammer. Billys und Bonos Stimmen passen perfekt zusammen. Dazu muss man sagen, dass der komplette Verdienst dieser Single den Flutopfern von New Orleans gespendet wurde. Weiter so..."
5,"- denn ich finde, das ist endlich mal wieder ein durchgängig hörbares und perfekt arrangiertes Electro-Album. Nicht ein einziger der insgesamt 10 sehr starken und atmosphärischen Songs fällt in irgendeiner Weise heraus. Hier Favoriten zu nennen ist eigentlich gar nicht möglich, jedes der Stücke ist eine kleine Sound-Welt für sich, die trotz oder auch aufgrund der eindringlichen Vocals letztendlich immer gute Stimmung beim Hören hinterläßt. Wahre Düsternis sucht man auf diesem Album vergebens, dafür kommt dieser Silberling einfach zu melodiös, ja fast schon poppig herüber mit deutlich technoider / tranceartiger Prägung ohne jemals kitschig oder übertrieben zu wirken. Hier wurden alle Gewürze wohldosiert an diesem Leckerbissen eingesetzt und so dürfte dieser auch viele neue Freunde außerhalb der Farbe schwarz finden. Fazit: zeitloser, dynamischer Future-Pop mit vielen clubtauglichen Tanzrhythmen aber auch ruhigeren starken Momenten und sehr viel dichter Atmosphäre =&gt; unbedingt mal reinhören; Anspieltipps: Human, Ground, Infinite, Regret, Complacent und natürlich die Singleauskoppelung Let the wind erase me."
5,"Mozart hatte 1785 für Tonkünstlersocietät endlich ein Werk abzuliefern, das er lange versprochen hatte.  Mozart wollte Mitglied der Societät sein, aber hatte eigentlich kom Komponieren gar keine Zeit. Da konnte er auf die unvollende Messe c-moll KV 427 zurückgreifen,reicherte diese um zwei Stücke, eine großartige Tenorarie darunter, an und dieses Werk wurde am 13. Marz 1785 innerhalb eines Benefiz-Konzerts aufgeführt ( Mitglied der Societät wurde er nicht !)  Mit dem italienischen Text eines unbekannten Autors wurde daraus Davidde penitente. Kuijken machte diese Einspielung bereits 1985. Auch heute kann man es noch immer gut hören. Wunderbar transparent und musikantisch der orchestrale Part. Mit Blochwitz hatte er einen Tenor, der damals in seinem Zenit stand,nach kometenhafter Karriere, die wenige Jahre zuvor begonnen hatte. Laki als Sopran ist nicht erste Wahl, aber sonst stimmt alles, auch der großartige nederlands kamerkoor. Auch unter Berücksichtigung der Aufnahmen von KV 427 ist diese eine der schönsten des Werks."
5,"Zahlreich waren in den letzten Jahren die Händel-Gesamtaufnahmen von Alan Curtis, doch erst mit diesem Fernando erreichen Interpretation und Aufnahmetechnik einen Standard, bei dem nichts mehr zu wünschen übrigbleibt. Besonders glücklich war die Entscheidung des Dirigenten, die beiden  Kastratenpartien nicht wie in den anderen Einspielungen mit  Frauenstimmen, sondern mit Countertenören zu besetzen, was dem Klangbild eine größere Vielfalt verleiht. Ein Glücksfall, daß mit Zazzo und Cencic gleich zwei erstklassige Vertreter ihrer Zunft gewonnen werden konnten. Doch auch die anderen Protagonisten leisten Erstklassiges. ""Fernando"" wurde in der späteren Fassung als ""Sosarme"" (die sich übrigens nur in den Rezitativen von der ersten Version unterscheidet) bereits zweimal mit barabarischen Strichen eingespielt, daher ist es besonders schön,die Urfassung des Werkes erstmal ungekürzt geniessen zu können. Ein echter Händelhöhepunkt der letzten Zeit, uneingeschränkte Kaufempfehlung!"
2,"Ton Koopman hat ein wunderbares Vorhaben in Gang gesetzt: alle Werke von Buxtehude zu präsentieren. Da ich die ca. 125 Vokalwerke dieses Komponisten für hochzuschätzende Perlen halte und sie schon seit Jahren fleißig sammle, begrüße ich Koopmans Absicht einer Gesamtaufnahme mit Inbrunst, denn die verschiedenen bisher erschienenen Produktionen nehmen immer wieder besonders die ""beliebteren"" Werke auf; das führt zu vielen Dubletten, während manches Stück bis heute uneingespielt blieb. Warum bin ich also nicht glücklich mit dieser CD? Ganz einfach: Es erweist sich, dass fast immer, wenn ich vergleichend andere Interpretationen gegen Koopmans Lesart höre, die anderen deutlich besser sind. Nur einige Beispiele: Warum lässt Koopman seine Sänger/innen so abgehackt und affektiert durch das ""Nichts!nichts!nichts!"" der Kantate Nr. 77 rasen, wo andere Ensembles ein wirkliches Nichtvorhandensein illustrierendes ""Nichts... nichts... nichts"" hinbekommen? Weshalb wechselt Koopman in der Kantate Nr. 41 andauernd das Tempo, die erste Strophe kaugummiartig tranig, das Schluss-Amen verhuscht, dazwischen mal so, mal so? In der Partitur steht davon in diesem Maße nichts. Aus welchem Grunde geht in unseren 2000er-Jahren bei einem renommierten Alte-Musik-Spezialisten eine Aufnahme durch, in der der Chorsopran wiederholt weder sauber einsetzt noch gemeinsam abspricht (ebenfalls Anfang von Nr. 41)? Das ist inakzeptabel. Überhaupt die Nr. 41, eine der eigentlich schönsten Kantaten der Barockliteratur. Woher nimmt der Dirigent das Recht, Pauken hinzu zu erfinden, und die Trompeten, die Buxtehude als einmaligen Effekt in der 3. Strophe einsetzt, am Ende wieder hinzuzusetzen, so dass der strahlende Schluss in albernen Bombast überkippt? In einer Live-Aufführung kann man solcherlei gerne ausprobieren, aber eine CD ist ja auch ""für die Ewigkeit"". Ansonsten leisten die Sänger/innen und das Orchester gute Arbeit, besonders die Streicher wissen hervorragend zu intonieren. Manche Merkwürdigkeit wie die gestopften Blechblasinstrumente in Nr. 116 erläutert das Beiheft nicht, so dass ich ohne weitere Quellen nicht sagen kann, ob Buxtehude das wirklich so wollte oder ob es sich nur um eine weitere Eigenmächtigkeit Koopmans handelt. Zusammenfassung: Als Buxtehude-Junkie werde ich die Serie weiter kaufen, aber langsam bin ich es herzlich leid, Werke, die ich schon anderweitig kenne, in Koopmans Interpretation zu hören."
2,"Eigentlich hatte ich fest vor, mir dieses Album zu kaufen, aber diese Scheibe ist das Geld nicht Wert. Zu den einzelnen Tracks: The Root of all Evil: Dieses Lied wirkt wie eines, das es nicht mehr auf den Vorgänger Train of Thought geschafft hat, insgesamt würde es stilistisch dort besser hinpassen. Das gipfelt gegen Ende, wo die Band bestimmte Stellen 1:1 aus ""This dying Soul"" übernommen hat. Nichts gegen musikalische ""Zitate"", aber das klingt dann doch eher nach Ideenrecycling. Dennoch ist dieser Track einer der stärkeren, sieht man vom ideenlosen Mittelteil ab (ca. 3. Minute). The Answer lies within: simple, langweile Schnulze. Besonders schlimm finde ich hier LaBries Gesang. Für mich ist dieser Song der absolute Tiefpunkt in der Bandgeschichte These Walls: Relativ pop-rockig geraten. Erinnert vom Klang her etwas an Green Days ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"", aber noch wesentlich möchtegern-epischer. I Walk Beside You: Auch wieder ein recht pop-rockiger Song. Ein gutes Beispiel dafür was passiert, wenn Dream Theater einen Song ""emotional"" interpretieren wollen: nervige Gefühlsduselei der all das fehlt, was man an Dream Theater liebt (z. B. gute und komplexe Strukturen). Wenn ich sowas hören wollen würde, würde ich Rosenstolz kaufen! Panic Attack: Einer der Lichtblicke in diesem Album, hört sich stilistisch auch wieder nach Train of Thought an. Zwar ist das brachiale Schlagzeug eher nervig, aber immerhin verbirgt sich in diesem Song mal wieder ein schönes Solo. Viel mehr aber auch nicht.  Never Enough: Wie so viele Lieder auf diesem Album wirkt auch dieses eher ideenlos und routiniert. Das Gitarrenspiel beschränkt sich auf zahlreiche immergleiche Arpeggi und die Medlodie wirkt uninspiriert und poppig (was vielleicht auch an LaBries Interpretation liegt). Sacrificed Sons: Endlich wieder ein Lichtblick. Fängt schwach an (Gesprächsfetzen ähnlich ""The Great Debate"", dann herumgeschnulze), baut dann ab ca. 4. Minuten auf. Komplexe Instrumentalpassagen, schönes ""Gefrickel"", schönes Ende.  Der Titeltrack ist in erster Linie lang - zu lang, die ersten ~10-12 Minuten könnte man quasi abschneiden, ohne dass sich am musikalischen Gehalt großartig etwas ändern würde. Der Rest des Songs knüpft nahtlos an bessere Zeiten an, aber dennoch wird man den über das Album hinweg aufgebauten Eindruck nicht los: man hat das alles schon gehört - bis auf Katastrophen wie The Answer lies within, die aber auch wirklich nicht sein müssen. Übrigens offenbart dieser Song auch wieder mal LaBrie als absoluten Schwachpunkt der Band: seine Stimme passt einfach zu solchen Schnulzen - aber nicht zu DT!  Lediglich der Titelsong lässt in der 2. Hälfte die Begeisterung wieder aufleben, die man früher bei fast jedem Song spürte. Ich hoffe inständig, dass dies nur ein Ausreißer war und dass DT mit der nächsten Scheibe wieder etwas bieten können, was dem Ruf dieser Band würdig ist. Allerdings zweifle ich daran, die Zeichen der Verbrauchtheit auf dieser CD sind überdeutlich."
1,"warnung! kauft dieses album bloß nicht, wenn ihr auf richtigen hip hop steht. richtig ist, das 1. album war an die spitze zu setzen weil es absolut gut war. falsch ist, dieses album als gut zu bewerten. sorry, aber dies ist mit abstand das schlechteste album was ich jemals gehört habe. lakmann kann man hier total vergessen weil er nur noch popelige reime bringt und flipstar hört sich an, als hätte er die letzten jahre im tiefsten ghetto verbracht. oberpeinlich, jetzt auf einmal voll auf pimp zu machen. und die beats sind auch nichts herausragendes, einfach nur der zeit angepasst. schade, ich hatte mich echt auf dieses album gefreut, gerade bei dem coolen albumtitel...aber es steckt leider gar nichts dahinter."
2,"Die CD sieht verlockend aus, ebenso klingt der Inhalt vielversprechend. Doch bei der CD handelt es sich um nichts anderes als um eine Neuauflage einer alten MC aus den 80er-Jahren mit Glockengeläuten zur Weihnachtszeit. Es wurden diegleichen, qualitativ z.T. mäßig-schlechten und vereinzelt - was den Glockenbestand der jeweiligen Kirche anbelangt - auch nicht mehr aktuellen Aufnahmen verwendet. Nur die Tracks 26 und 27 sind auf der CD neu hinzugefügt, diese waren auf der MC nicht zu hören. Angeblich sollen im letzten Track die Glocken des Wiener Stephansdomes zu hören sein - angeblich, denn es stimmt schlichtweg nicht, da zumindest zwei der vier zu hörenden Glocken im Geläute des Stephansdomes einfach nicht enthalten sind. Fazit: Eine CD mit gravierenden Mängeln und Fehlern, die zumindest ihre Berechtigung durch die zum Teil sehr alten Aufnahmen hat. Wer Wert auf aktuelle, hochwertige Aufnahmen legt, sollte auf jeden Fall die Finger davon lassen. Wem es ""nur"" darum geht, irgendwelche verschiedenen Glocken zu hören, ohne Ansprüche an Qualität und Aktualität zu stellen, der kann die paar Euro durchaus investieren."
1,"Die Alkoholprobleme Hetfields, der Aus- oder Aufstieg (?) des Bassisten Jason Newsted zu Voivod, temporär sogar zum ""Prince of darkness"" Ozzy himself, sowie die unsäglichen Diskussionen um Lars Ulrichs Beteiligung am Niedergang Napster`s haben der Megaband heftigst zugesetzt. ""St.Anger"" soll nun der Rundumschlag sein, der allen zeigen soll, dass Metallica zurück sind, innovativ und heavy wie nie zuvor... Mit im Gepäck, ein neuer Tieftöner, der aber nur auf der limitiert mitgelieferten DVD zu bestaunen ist. Schade drum, denn ex- Suicidal Tendencies (ironischerweise auch ex- Ozzy) Groovesau Trujillo hat wirklich das Zeug dazu, einen würdigen Ersatz abzugeben (natürlich nur für Newsted,...Cliff Burton lassen wir hier mal aussen vor.). Tatsächlich auf dem Album zu hören ist also Mega- Produzent Bob Rock ( neben Metallica auch mit The Cult oder Mötley Crüe beschäftigt gewesen), der neben dem Einspielen der Basslines noch ein wenig an den Reglern gedreht hat. Und das hört man, denn hätte sich Mr. Rock etwas mehr um seinen eigentlichen Job gekümmert, würde es mir jetzt nicht so schwer fallen, mir das gesamte Album nur ein einziges Mal am Stück anhören zu können. Zugegeben, ich war nie Fan dieser Band, aber ihre Fertigkeiten und ihr Status als eine der größten Metalcombos, sind auch mir nicht verborgen geblieben, doch was die Herren Hammett, Hetfield und Ulrich hier abliefern,  ist sogar für mich absolut enttäuschend.  Aber worum geht es bei ""St.Anger""? Was ist die Essenz des Albums? Sind Metallica back to the roots gegangen? Ich vermag es nicht zu beantworten, denn genau genommen handelt es sich bei den 11 Darbietungen gar nicht wirklich um Songs. Vielmehr hat man das Gefühl, ein Metal- Patchwork, zusammengehalten aus immer wiederkehrenden Sounds und sogar Riffs, erstanden zu haben. Schlechte pseudo- innovative Drum-Effekte, grösstenteils magere Vocal-Lines und bei Bandkumpel Pepper Keenan ( Down, C.O.C.) geborgte Southern- Rock- Riffs lassen die Vermutung aufkommen, dass es sich bei ""St.Anger"" um Proberaum- Jams handelt, doch dann wäre  das alles schon fast wieder ""cool"". Tatsache ist jedoch, dass ich einen regulären Output in den Händen halte und mir nichts weiter als ein Gedanke kommt: Kalkül, reines Kalkül.. Hier wird mit runtergetrimmten Gitarren Ausschau nach neuen Käuferschichten gehalten, hier wird mit  allzu modernen Trademarks versucht, sich aus der tiefen Grube des Mainstreams zu befreien. Kommerzieller Selbstmord hin oder her( als wäre das bei Metallicas zuvorigen Verkaufsbilanzen überhaupt Thema), es wird manchen gefallen, und manchen eben nicht. Da ich mich  zur zweiteren Gruppe zähle, möchte ich mich gar nicht intensiver mit einzelnen ""Songs"" befassen, denn das wäre nur eine Bestätigung für diese ausgemachte Mogelpackung. Jedem, der sich dennoch ein eigenes Bild von ""St.Anger"" machen möchte, sei nur geraten, sich stets vor Auge zu halten, dass es sich hier um die wahrscheinlich bestverdienendste Metal-Truppe aller Zeiten handelt, und eben nicht um vier Burschen mit ""anger"" im Bauch, egal wie oft Metallica noch darauf verweisen werden,beim Einspielen der vorliegenden Platte mächtig böse gewesen zu sein. Sehr subjektiv, werden jetzt viele sagen, und ich muß zugeben, mit meiner Kritik auch einige gute Passagen zu übergehen, Passagen in denen man sich denkt: Halt, Jungs...Hier weitermachen! (z.B. beim Titeltrack oder ""The invisible kid"")...aber mal ehrlich; ist es nicht erbärmlich, bei einer Band, die Classics wie ""Master of Puppets"" oder ""...And justice for all"" in Silber betoniert hat, von einigen wenigen, guten Momenten zu schwärmen...??"
1,"ich will hier keinen Epos verfassen, wie der gute Rob Halford, und bringe es kurz und knapp auf den Punkt: - dies ist kein Metal-Konzept-Album a la 'Operation Mindcrime' sondern eine Rock-Oper, die stark nach den 70igern klingt - Rob Halford singt brilliant! Überhaupt ist seine Stimme das einzige ""Instrument"" , das nicht durchgehend gleich klingt. Vermutlich ist Nostradamus ein Produkt der Eitelkeit des Herren Halford. - In den Interviews würde angekündigt, dass auch für die alten Fans was dabei sein würde - eine Lüge! Der Titeltrack ist der einzige Song, der an Priest erinnert ... und eigentlich nur solange eine Metal-Song ist, solange Rob nicht singt. - Bis auf den Titelsong besteht das Album nur aus Midtempo-Stücken, die nur durch häufiges Hören von einander zu unterscheiden sind - einfach langweilig. - erschwerend kommt noch hinzu, dass man das Gefühl hat, 80% der Riffs von verschiedenen Black Sabbath-Scheiben zu kennen. Das könnte eigentlich für dieses Album sprechen, doch leider gelingt es nicht diese auch nur annähernd so rocken zu lassen, wie ein Iommi es noch im Halbschlaf hinbekommt. Fazit: 1 Punkt für Robs Gesang und meine Anerkennung für den Mut"
2,"... liefert nun mylene farmer, die erste schlechte cd. bei 6 top-studioalben, kann man das ihr ja noch verzeihen. aber trotzdem schade ums warten."
4,"Als ich erfuhr, dass ein Greatest Hits-Album von ""RobDJ"" veröffentlicht wird, habe ich mir zunächst auch an den Kopf gegriffen und fragte mich: ""Was soll das? Jeder eingefleischte Fan hat ja wohl schon längst alle diese Hits auf mehreren Alben und Singles im Schrank stehen!! Wozu also noch ein `Greatest Hits`?? Hat Mr. Williams es jetzt schon so nötig??"" Ich persönlich werde mir diese Platte auf keinen Fall anschaffen - doch ich möchte den Brit-Pop-Gott und das neue Album nicht ganz so schlecht machen, da es sicherlich neuen Fans ein willkommener Einstieg sein wird, denn für solche, die noch kein Album von Robbie besitzen -gibt es solche Leute überhaupt noch??- ist diese CD ein MUST (und würde viel Geld sparen, wenn RW-Fans vernünftige Leute wären). Da sie es aber nicht sind, kann ich Newbies nur empfehlen, auf jeden Fall auch ""Escapology"", ""Sing und Swing when you're winning"" und ""Live Summer 2003"" zu kaufen, dies sind Alben, die bei mir ganz hoch im Kurs stehen, weil dort wie ich finde, die wahren Greatest Hits zu finden sind.  Abschließend ist zu sagen, dass Fans wohl eher auf das erste ""only written by RW""-Album warten und dass seine Greatest Hits gar nicht alle auf eine CD draufpassen!! Also natürlich auch von mir 4 Sterne, weil ich ja sonst untreu wäre. Und wer Radio noch nicht kennt: Nachdem ich diesen Song das erste Mal im Radio (wie könnte es auch anders sein) gehört habe, ging er mir nicht mehr aus dem Ohr, obwohl ich ihn etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig fand. Ich habe mir den Text zwar noch nicht durchgelesen, aber er klingt wie eine Persiflage auf die ganzen zusammengemixten Popsongs mit Synthesizern, künstlich erzeugten Beats usw."
5,hier ist erstmals eine zusammenarbeit zweier exzentrischer musiker die sich perfekt ergänzen-lange instrumentalpassagen die an frühere king crimson erinnern mit den gewohnt wundervoll leicht sentimental angehauchten popballaden einens david sylvian-beim ersten hören mag dem eingefleischten sylvian fan diese kost noch etwas schwer verdaulich sein doch nach mehrmaligem hören entwickelt sich eine sucht die einen nicht mehr loslässt-diese klanggebilde fräsen sich ins limbische system und schütten literweise pheromone aus-göttlich-eine cd aus einem guss ohne schwachpunkt-volle punktzahl
1,"""Wir sind Helden"" (der Bandname scheint Programm) inzenzieren sich lediglich selbst vor einem willfährigen Publikum. Die Musik ist schlecht, die Texte selbstbeweihräuchernd und von einen durschaubaren Scheinorginalität. Das gleiche Prinzip, das wir von ""PUR"" erkennen."
1,"Bin wirklich ein großer Manson Fan und für mich ist dieser Mann gott. Habe mir dieses Album sofort gekauft als es rauskam und war total enttäuscht, denn dies ist nicht Manson. Natürlich sind Sound und Texte auf diesem album wirklich sehr gut, aber wer den wirklichen Manson kennt wird nur enttäuscht. Fazit: Wer auf gute ruhige Musik steht kann bedenkenlos zugreifen und dann ist dieses Album auch mehr als nur 5 sterne wert, aber wer auf den richtigen Manson sound steht bloß finger weg."
5,"Ich besitze zur Zeit alle Coal Chamber CD's doch ist dies eine der Besten.Besonders die Songs wie (Fiend),(Glow)oder (One Step) sowie (Friend)und(Dark Days)für Fans wirklich ein echtes Muss.  Ich sag bloss ""La Prensa De A Centavo En Mexico`"""
5,"Wer die Glamrocker Hanoi Rocks (ebenfalls aus Finnland) mitsamt Kajal und Glitterfummel mag, dazu Guns'n'Roses toll findet, und auch Nirvana im CD-Regal stehen hat, der sollte hier auf keinen Fall vorbeilaufen! Denn diese sind laut Jonne Aaron, dem schmächtigen Sänger mit der unerwartet mächtigen Stimme, die grossen Vorbilder der Band. Und einiges davon findet sich auch in ihrer Musik wieder, ohne dass sich hier ein Abklatsch bietet. Vielmehr haben Negative ihren eigenen Stil mit Wiedererkennungswert. Fetzige Kracher sowie gefühlvolle Balladen und eingängige Gitarrenriffs lassen die Songs schnell zum Ohrwurm werden. ""The Moment Of Our Love"" hatte es sich in Finnland 2003 direkt an der Spitze der Charts gemütlich gemacht, und wird sicherlich auch in Deutschland seinen Weg dahin nicht verfehlen. Das in Suomi bereits erschienene Nachfolgealbum ist ebenfalls wieder direkt von 0 auf #1 geschnellt, was beweist: Hier ist kein One-Hit-Wonder am Werk! Dazu sind die Jungs auch noch ein echter Augenschmaus. Also: kaufen, kaufen, kaufen!"
2,"Okay, I like only 3 or 4 songs of the album... it's totally different than the last albums! Change-- Very cool Intro I think!!!  Girl they won't believe it -- is okay, nice hook and everything but not my style, sounds like they copied and old song, you know what I mean  Headturner --  the same  Tell me 'bout it -- Cool Stuff and it's definitely the best song for a single-release! +++++  Tell me what we're gonna do -- Sorry, but extremely boring...    Put your hands on me -- I don't feel that song.... it's dead...  Music -- Great song! The rap of Lauryn is definitely 8 bars to long but the hook and verses are great!! +++  Arms of my baby -- Verses are nice and sweet, but the chorus??!!!!! It disturbs the song. But a nice bridge.  Bad Habit -- nothing special  Proper Nice -- boring, filler for the LP  Bruised but not broken -- Nice track. I can feel the song! ++++  Baby Baby Baby -- I heard it before....  What were we thinking -- It's okay, but didn't touch me."
1,"Naja, jetzt ist's halt Musik die man von einer 19jährigen erwartet, wenn sie ""ihren eigenen Weg"" geht! Schade."
4,"Ja diese vergleiche sind schon furchtbar heutzutage, aber auch diese Junge Dame scheint jemandem zu ähneln, meiner meinung nach Leann Rimes. aber sie hat atürlich auch was eigenes, dieser song hat sehr viel kraft und Feeling. von mir gibts 4 Sterne da dieser Song wirklich gut gelungen, und auch perfekt zur jahreszeit passt."
1,"Schade George Michael, nach so langer Wartezeit ein so lahmes Album abzuliefern. Dann wundert's nicht, wenn Herr Michael auch noch seinen Abschied aus dem Musik-Business verkündet. Dieses Album kommt bei weitem nicht an ""Older""(1996) ran."
5,"Dieses Konzertmitschnitt beweist nochmals, dass Karajan im Konzert viel besser als im Studio war. Obwohl Tonqalität nicht wunderschön ist (Mono), empfehle ich diese aufnahme jedem Musikfreund. Karajan ist nicht so kalt wie im Studio, sondern zeigt, dass er auch Gefühle hatte. Hier ""Dies irae"" erwirkt beim Hörer wirklich Angst und ""Lacrimosa"" ist voll Tränen. Chor und Solisten bekommen von mir nich 5, sondern 6 Sterne."
1,"Als ich die neue CD hörte glaubte ich ich hätte mich komplett vertan. Ich habe Musik erwartet, schnell und laut. Gekriegt habe ich ein Hörbuch. Es ist ja ganz nett, wenn es auf einer CD ein Intro al a Manowar gibt. Wenn die CD jedoch zu 70 % aus vorgelesenen Heldensagen besteht, zugegebener Maßen in gut verständlichem Englisch, dann ist die CD Schrott!"
2,"kinder, kinder so gehts ja wohl nun nicht. ihr treibt einen quofritzen der fastersten stunden in den wahnsinn mit euren reviews! meinem landsmann aus chur muss ich zu gute halten, dort oben ist die luft was dünner... aber kommt meine herren, last mal das dorf um die kirche stehen. klar, jedem seine meinung, muss sein. einwände der fundierten art: seit die besetzung '85 komplett verändert wurde (erstmals zum rundummkathastrophen-release mit dem boland-gossenheuler zu beweinen und beklagen) muss es einfach mind. 2 punkte abzug geben für die hereinnahme der beiden neuen der fraktion rythmus, beide kategorie ""wunsch-schwiegersohn"". stell man sich doch mal vor, ac/dc ersetzen cliff williams durch einen fretlessfritzen der dazu noch ohne plek spielt.. weiter fällt auf, dass für die jeweiligen studioalben von quo, bis eben 1984, immer einige elemente und fragmente der jeweils aktuell angesagten stilrichtung verarbeitet wurden. zum beispiel '79 auf ""can't stand the heat"" -disco war soeben gelandet- hört man off-hi-hats und brasssätze. '81 war nwobhm pate gestanden für die produktion ""never too late"", eine böse gitarrenwand, trocken, drums nach hinten gemixt, vocals ebenfalls ohne viel effekt, komprimiert, trocken verhältnissmässig leise. oder '72 für piledriver, psychadelic im aufwind, lese man den text zu ""paper plane"". es war wohl nicht pfefferminz-the, der den zugang zu den verarbeiteten gedanken öffnete.. wäre beliebig weiter zu führen. an und für sich sind quo '84 gestorben. was heute noch als remaints übrig ist, taugt bestimmt zu einer fetzigen partyband. den dampfhammerboogie der 70'er und frühen 80'er, '76 livealbum sei mein zeuge, der ist nicht mehr. lustigerweise gibt es über den besten quosong noch immer keine einigung unter den fans, wohl aber über den schlechtesten... wer meinen ausführungen bis hierher gefolgt ist und die alten quo nicht kennt, soll bei den jungen leuten ja durchaus vorkommen, dem empfehle ich die tonträger nach release '85 staub ansetzen zu lassen und dafür die vorgängigen veröffentlichungen zu hören. das musste mal gesagt sein, musste das mal, also wirklich!"
2,"Über Sinn bzw. Unsinn eines neuen Live-Albums der Stones läßt sich sicher streiten. Ich kann mir auch vorstellen, dass die-hard fans nach jeder Live-Veröffentlichung lechzen.  Ich habe auch nichts gegen gute Live-Alben, doch was einem hier geboten wird, ist eigentlich schon peinlich: zu erwähnen wäre das lieblos gestaltete booklet, die fehlenden Angaben zum Aufnahmeort, die gleichen Lieder wie schon auf der 4er-DVD Box vom letzten Jahr etc. Das was jedoch am meisten stört bzw. unangenehm auffällt, ist der für heutige Verhältnisse schlechte Sound. Der Drumsound klingt viel zu blechern, die Gitarren sind zu dominierend und die Vocals von Mick Jagger klingen überraschend dünn. Wer schon mal ein Arena-Konzert besucht hat, weiß dass dort die Vocals nicht wie in einem Club klingen. Das man die Background Sängerinnen kaum hört, stört schon gar nicht mehr beim schlechten Gesamteindruck. Laut Info hat hier Bob Clairmountain letzte Hand an den Mix gelegt, was ich nicht glauben kann, da er sonst astreine Sachen mit Springsteen, Bon Jovi oder auch Kiss gemacht hat. Hier hatte wohl Don Was die Hauptverantwortung."
1,"als riesiger fan von veronika fischer habe ich mich unheimleich gefreut endlich wieder neues"" material"" von ihr zu bekommen. nachdem mir ihr letztes album ""tief im sommer"" überhaupt nicht gefallen hat war ich gespannt was diesmal kommen würd.schlechter konnte es ja nicht mehr kommen.dachte ich!langweilige und dahinplätschernde meldien,texte ohne jeglichen sinn und das alles ohne einen einzigen up-tempo song.ein winteralbum, welches im frühjahr erscheint.CLEVER!!! dies wird mit aller sicherheit der letzte ""blindkauf"" von mir sein."
5,Doch dieses Exemplar unterscheidet sich extrem von den Vorgängern! Sie bietet viel mehr Trance und nicht so viel Komerz wie die beiden Vorgänger! Deshalb hat sie 5 Sterne auf jeden Fall verdient!
1,"Also man konnte doch schon einiges erwarten, doch was A. hier bietet ist wirklich ein Graus. Sorry, da hoere ich mir sogar das Gekrätze von Daniel K. an. Oh man...."
1,"Nach der wirklich schönen ersten Singleauskopplung ""Liebe ist.."" kommt mit dem Titelsong des Albums ein ziemlicher Absturz. Leider sagt der Song nicht viel aus (anders bei ""Liebe ist""), noch dazu kommt das ständige Wiederholen der Titelzeile, mit einer Kuppelfrage die eher das Niveau eines 14jährigen Schulmädchens besitzt. Schade die Reife und Weisheit von ""Liebe ist"" wird mit diesem Kinderlied wieder total zunicht gemacht. Da hat Nena schon mehr Anspruch abgeliefert."
1,"Dass dieser Song in Deutschland und USA Nummer 1 ist, zeigt genau eines: Fans von Lil Jon und Ludacris kaufen ihn. Viele langjährige Usher-Fans, ich inclusive, sind allerdings schockiert, wie der R'n'B-Guru seine schönen Songs gegen so einen Rap-Dreck ausgetauscht hat. Wirklich enttäuschend, und wirklich austauschbar."
1,"Leider haben die Leute die im Hintergrund die Fäden ziehen und die Songs auswählen ihren Joker verspielt. Wenn sie als erste Single ""Strung Out"" oder einen anderen der raren Ohrwürmer des Albums genommen hätten, wären vielleicht mehr Leute von Room 2012 begeistert, oder würden sie nicht vorneherein ablehnen. Obwohl ich selbst niemanden der Bandmitglieder toll finde (außer Tialda die stimmlich unterfordert ist und besser Solosängerin werden sollte) muss ich sagen dass manche Lieder mir wirklich nicht mehr aus dem Kopf gehen und ich mich des öfteren erwische wie ich sie summe... Das Lied hier ist jedoch kein Ohrwurm, man vergisst es ziemlich schnell wieder und die Gesangseinagen sind schlecht gewählt. Und Julian immer als zweiten Justin Timberlake verkaufen wollen und ihn deshalb diese hohen Stellen singen zu lassen, geht meiner Meinung nach auch gar nicht. Ich würde jedem von dieser CD abraten, wenn ihr etwas von Room 2012 hören wollt, dann greift gleich zum Album, da sind wenigstens ein paar gute Tiel vertreten!"
2,"Was Miss Aguilera mit ihrer Masche bezwecken will, ist klar - Sex sells, leider fallen zu viele darauf herein. Der bisherige Erfolg der Single hängt einzig und allein mit dem Video zusammen, denn der Song an sich ist gesanglich absolut nicht niveauvoll. Ich bleib' dabei: Der Promotion-Rahmen ist einfach nur billig und darauf kann ich verzichten."
1,"In bester Erwartung auf einen perfekten Mix der Hits der letzten 10 Jahre, hab ich mir die aktuelle DD-Best of zugelegt.  Eine einzige Fehlentscheidung. Die Lieder sind ganz gut. Allerdings hat man sich an ihnen sattgehört. Sie sind nichtmal so bearbeitet, dass man sagen kann okay, der Mix ist toll. Aber hier wurden nur einige Hits kopiert und auf einer neuen CD zusammengestellt. Das kann ich aber zu Hause auch selbst. Ich kann nur sagen: Lasst die Finger von den CD. Sind das Geld echt nicht wert!"
1,"In der heutigen Musikszene scheint große Einfallslosigkeit zu herrschen, wenn immer neue 80er Klassiker mehr schlecht als recht gecovert werden. Gute Cover-Versionen kann man an einer Hand abzählen, aber dieses Lied gehört sicher nicht dazu und reiht sich in die Lange Liste der misslungenen Cover-Versionen ein: Flugzeuge im Bauch, Hard To Say I'm Sorry, In The Air tonight etc.. Schnelles Geld durch eine bekannte Melodie, die durch den Computer aufgepeppt wurde, heißt hier die Methode. Mike Oldfield wird wohl ein gewisses Schmerzensgeld erhalten haben, da nun auch noch sein Hit ""To France"" gecovert wurde. Das heutzutage auch noch gute neue Musik gemacht wird beweißen Leute wie Herbert Grönemeyer, Weezer, Dave Matthews, Peter Gabriel, Jimmy Eat World und Coldplay."
1,"Mit grossem Interesse habe ich die Cover-Version gekauft und gehofft, das die Plazierung in den Charts für Qualität spricht. Aber ich wurde enttäuscht."
1,Suavamente???? Das hätte sich Scooter auch sparen können. Die Single ist einfach schlecht.Lasst lieber die Finger davon und wartet die nächste ab. Hoffentlich wird die nicht wieder so`n Schroooooooooootttttttttttttttt!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,"die doppel cd ist echt der absolute knaller. viele lieder mit echt derben flyern vor allem das lied von scott brown- ghost auf der ersten cd hat einen super flyer mit frauen gesang. des weiteren sind super lieder von angerfist, headbanger/delerium (sehr zu empfehlen), evil activities, weapon x, crimelab/ alex bunkerfreak, deevoid zu hören. die letzteren sind nicht all zu bekannt liefern aber auf der scheibe absolute hammer tracks ab. die cd ist mit ihren vielen flyer liedern einfach der hammer."
2,"Byrne versucht auf ""Feelings"" vielseitig zu sein, aber die Songs packen nicht, plätschern seicht dahin. Viele der verwendeten Versatzstücke klingen oft allzu klischeehaft. Das mag als Hintergrundberieselung vielleicht ganz gut funktionieren, erreicht aber nicht annähernd die Qualität der Talking Heads. Der Mann kann mehr. Lediglich das Cover des Albums weiss durch Witz und Stil zu gefallen ;-)"
4,"Evidence One hat mich eigentlich von Anfang an positiv überrascht. Endlich mal wieder eine Deutsche Band die geilen Metal spielt! Das schöne an der Cd ist, das die 13(!) Songs im Prinzip wie in einem Guss durchlaufen ohne im Prinzip zu langweilen. Nur der schwere Anfang mit „Moonsigh"" gefällt mir nicht so gut, ansonsten aber Daumen hoch, geile Mucke!"
1,"Nach den letzten beiden nicht gerade hörfreudigen CDs gibs hier auch nichts neueres oder altbewährtes. Mag zwar künstlerisch wertvoll sein, wenn man aber das Gejaule von Tom York hört bekomme ich Depressionen. Ich finde eine gute CD zeichnet sich auch dadurch aus, dass man diese sich stundenlang anhören und vor allen Dingen ertragen kann."
4,"Viele Bands aus der Krautrockszene hatten zwar viele interessante musikalische Ideen, aber leider nur zum Teil die handwerklichen Fähigkeiten dazu diese auch umzusetzen. ""Streetmark"" dagegen war eine der wenigen Formationen, die ihre Instrumente beherrschten und daher ihre ambitionierten Kompositionen auch ansprechend vertonen konnten. ""Nordland"" ist dadurch nicht wie viele vergleichbare andere Alben mit der klebrigen Patina des amateurhaften belegt, sondern auch heute noch gut hörbar."
5,"Hallo erst mal an alle! Habe das Album jetzt schon einige Male durchgehört und bin 101%-ig überzeugt! Die ersten 2 Alben waren auch schon gut, aber dieses haut mich vom Hocker! Ihr werdet den Kauf genauso wie ich sicher nicht bereuen... nicht nur etwas für Rihanna-Fans! Bei meinen ""lieblings""tracks muss ich euch leider enttäuschen da ich eigentlich alle songs sehr gut finde...Aber: diese habe ich bis jz am häufigsten gehört: Umbrella (na klar ;)), Sell Me Candy, Rehab, Question Existing, Cry und mein persönlich absoluter Hit Good Girl Gone Bad! Viel Spaß mit einem Album, das man endlich mal wieder gerne und oft anhört...ACHTUNG: hoher Sucht-Faktor xD LG eure Musikmaus Nicky"
5,"Einfach nur gigantisch! Habe in letzter Zeit die Musik-Charts auser acht gelassen. Immer mal wieder, sei es durch Radio, Autos oder Fitnesscenter, am  vorbeigehen klasse Lieder gehört. Und dann ragten da die besonderen Lieder heraus. An jene die einschlagen wie ne Bombe und an die man sich noch in 20Jahren erinnern wird. Habe bis einschließlich heute nicht gewusst oder rausgehört, dass viele dieser Lieder von ein und der selben Künstlerin sind, von Nelly Furtado. Schon Hammer! Und dann noch die einzelnen Lieder, welche schon jedes für sich genial ist, auf einem gesamten Album zusammengepresst, dass sprengt dann echt den Rahmen. Könnte ich 6Sterne vergeben, dann denke ich hätte dieses Album von Nelly Furtado eindeutig diese verdient!"
1,"Stefan Raab hat's mal wieder geschafft: Aus einem blassen Abiturienten mit Rollkragenpulli macht er einen Popstar. Hut ab! Dass die Stimme von Mäxchen sich anhört wie Michael Bolton mit Halsentzündung, der Song klingt wie ein Stevie Wonder Imitat für Arme und der Text mit den Englisch-Kenntnissen eines Grundschülers verfasst werden könnte, scheint im allgemeinen Hype untergegangen sein.Klingt wie schon tausendmal im Formatradio gehört. Für das mit Sicherheit(jeden Cent abkassieren!)schnellstmöglich zusammengeschluderte Album ahnt man Übles,kann der Knallcharge doch weder komponieren oder ein Instrument spielen. Bleibt zu hoffen, dass mit diesem Abgesang endlich Schluss ist mit gecasteten Milchbubis und bald mal wirkliche neue Talente für die deutsche Musiklandschaft entdecken werden"
5,"Das kennen wir ja schon: Immer dann, wenn es gerade gaaanz ruhig um die zierliche Dänin geworden ist, kommt ein nächster Geniestreich.  Diesmal haben sich die Produzenten auf Sommerfeeling eingeschlagen.  ""Was A Time"" überzeugt mit groovey Club-Beats, eingängiger Melodie, wenig Text und Latin-like Gitarren-Riffs. Die Rezeptur für einen Sommerhit 2004 stimmt also."
1,"Das neueste Produkt aus dem Hause der ewig pubertierenden Großmäuler Gallagher. Belangloses Gutarrengeschraddel ohne Charakter und eigene Ideen, unoriginell, banal, zum Gähnen langweilig. Wie gehabt. Die Apotheose des Mittelmaßes. Bewundernswert allenfalls, wie sie es immer wieder schaffen, ihren musikalischen Second Hand-Ramschladen als geniale Musik zu vermarkten."
2,"Gleich vorweg muss ich erwähnen, dass meine Sterne rein subjektiv vergeben sind. Gothic Rock und Industrial sind nur sporadisch vorhanden. Etwas vordergründig elektronisches findet man nur im letzten und vorletzten Song. Wer NINs und Marilyns mit gotischen Elementen angereicherten NuMetal mit Industrial verwechselt, ist selbst Schuld. *zwinka*  Handwerklich würde ich auf jeden Fall mit gut werten. Hizumi trifft nicht immer perfekt den Ton und auch sonst ist der Mix etwas schief hier und da. Darum die Abzüge.  Für Liebhaber von Dir en grey, kagerou, MUCC, Gazette, ... eigentlich der ganzen neueren Visual Kei Generation, die sich an Amerikas NuMetal orientiert, ist die CD empfehlenswert, musikalisch und visuell abwechslungsreich gestaltet."
5,"Mit ihrem 4. Album „Hexenwind“ haben die Tiroler einen sehr grossen Schritt getan, was Veränderungen betrifft, und sich enorm weiterentwickelt. Das ist bei Dornenreich eine nur allzu logische Fortführung, da ihre Musik sehr stark unter dem Aspekt der „persönlichen Entwicklung + weltlichen Empfindungen“ steht, und diese entwickeln sich natürlich weiter. So geschieht es, dass „Hexenwind“ in einem reiferen Gewand erscheint, und auch inhaltlich ist die Erzählkunst unverkennbar Dornenreich. Ein ewiges Bestreben danach, Empfindungen und Wahrnehmungen noch tiefer zu ergründen, ganz zu sich selbst zu finden.  Während „Her von welken Nächten“ noch eine verzweifelte Suche nach dem Ich darstellte, hat man bei „Hexenwind“ das Gefühl, etwas gefunden zu haben. Das Album lädt ein, darin zu versinken, sich fallen zu lassen. Es strömt Ruhe und Geborgenheit aus.  Musikalisch besteht der dominierende Anteil aus Akustikgitarren und Flüstern, im Gegensatz zu früher eine Gradwanderung. Doch darauf kommt es bei Dornenreich ohnehin nicht an, „Hexenwind“ steht von der 1. bis zu letzten Sekunde unter dem Zeichen der Magie.  All diejenigen, die schon immer zu schätzen wussten, was Dornenreich ausmacht– deren pure Essenz – die werden an dem Album ihre innige Freude haben. „HEXENWIND“ IST SCHON JETZT EIN MEILENSTEIN."
5,"Paradise Lost haben sich einmal mehr wieder selbst übertroffen. Nach dem schon sehr sehr guten Album ""Icon"" kam nun das Album des Jahrzehnts dieser Musikszene. Ich muß anmerken, dass ich zu der Zeit schon seit langem ein treuer Fan war und schon alle bis dato erschienenen Alben besaß und schon seit ewigen Tagen höre, aber als ich dieses Album in meinen Player packte, war alles andere vergessen.  Das beste auf dem neuen Album der Mannen aus Halifax ist die Abwechslung. Alle Titel sind dabei immer bestens geeignet um in Ruhe seinen Gedanken freien Lauf zu lassen. Die harten, dunklen Riffs und Gitarrenklänge sind der Background zu diesem führendem Klassiker.  ""Encantment"" und ""Shades of God"" gehören dabei zu meinen absoluten Lieblingsstücken. Mir läuft es selbst heute (8 Jahre später!) immer noch kalt den Rücken runter, wenn ich morgens in meinem Auto diese Titel anspiele und die einprägsame Stimme von Nick vernehme, wie z.B. in ""Enchantment"" : [...]REVERSE THE FROWN AND LET THE POWER SURGE[...] - solche Textstellen zusammen mit dem Sound sind bis heute absolute weltklasse und bislang unübertroffen. ""Draconian Times"" ist jedoch im Hinblick auf alle älteren Alben anders. Jeder Titel ist absolut erstklassig und hätte ein Video verdient. Zu den besten und auch live (aus eigener Erfahrung) imposantesten Songs zählen ""Hallowed Land, ""The Last Time"" und vor allem ""Hands of Reason"". Die etwas schnelleren Stücke ""Once Solemn"" und ""Forever Failure"" lassen das Herz jedes Kenners höher schlagen.  Kauft diese Scheibe und genießt diese Welle von Emotionen. Düster, traurig aber auch feurig und kraftvoll. Eines der besten Alben, welches damals und zur Zeit (!) in diesem Genre zu haben ist!!!"
1,"also erstmal muss ich sagen dass ich die murderdolls gestern als support von papa roach in münchen gesehen habe, und was diese band zu bieten hat ist wirklich schwach. nicht nur schlechte texte sondern auch eine musik die nicht annähernd an slipknot &amp; co. rankommen zeugen von der schwäche dieser band.lächerliche verkleidung und stures rumgebrülle rauben einem den letzten nerv. wo slipknot, korn ect. einfallsreiche textpassagen oder aufwendige gitarrenriffs haben da können die murderdolls lange nicht mithalten. sowohl schlechte cd als auch schlechte live-band. spart euch das geld!!"
5,"Wer noch echte handgemachte Rockmusik mag ist hier bestens aufgehoben. Tolle Texte, authentische Stimme und einfach tolle Rockmusik ohne Schnörkel, Geigen und Kirchenchor.. St.Pauli wie es leibt und lebt. Am liebsten mit`ner Flasche Bier in der Hand zu hören. Nur live ist Ohrenfeidt noch besser."
1,"""Jupiter Jones vom Detektivbüro 'Die Dr3i'"". Sorry, das ist es nicht mehr. Da hat der Pumuckl mehr mit Hui Buh gemein. Es ist mir egal, wer an dem verfahrenen Markenrecht-Streit Schuld ist, als eingefleischter Fan hängt man eben an den Elementen, die die ""Drei Fragezeichen"" zum Kult machten. So kann ich ja auch TKKG hören. Ich habe mir die ersten Folgen angehört, aber der Spaß von früher stellt sich nicht mehr ein."
4,"mir gefällt das album sehr gut. ein paar schnellere punkige songs, ein paar langsamere/balladen, alle mit guten texten und melodie. herausstechen für mich: strom, innen alles neu, leben ist tödlich, die letzte schlacht. lediglich das duett finde ich einfach nur gähn, deshalb und wegen der ohne das duett für mich zu kurzen spielzeit nur 4 sterne."
1,"Die alten Titel wurden leider neu aufgenommen. Schade, da die Masterbänder ja noch irgendwo im Keller schlummern. ""Billige"" Produktion."
1,"Da schaltet man die Glotzevielleicht 3mal die Woche an und an so einem Sonntagabend muss ich so ein Videoclip sehen. Die Dame nennt sich Liza Li und ich erinnere mich bei dieser Stimme gezwungenermaßen an paar Jahre zuvor. Stichwort: Tic Tac Toe. Wo man damals mit jenen frechen(?!) Texten pubatierende Teenies erreichen konnte, war diese Musik aber auch ne Weile später einfach nur noch peinlich,nichtsaussagend und wurde auch schnell wieder vergessen. Diese Dame versuchts ähnlich mit ähnlich stupiden Texten gepaart mit ""Rock"". Ein Nietenarmband hier, schwarzgefärbte Haare da und alles zusammen gibt mir das Gefühl: Liza Li will mir und viele Anderen hier ziemlichen (Entschuldigung für diesen Ausdruck) banalen Mist andrehen. Zitat aus dem Text: Ich könnte dich erschießen / richtig Blut vergießen / diese kleine Schlampe gleich dazu .... ich brauch dich nicht, du Penner / denn die Welt ist voller Männer...  Das Mädel ist gerade mal 18, besitzt nicht viel Lebenserfahrung und will mir von etwas erzählen, wovon sie wohlmöglich keine Ahnung hat. Zu dem ein Text, der einfach nur kindisch ist. Es hat aber auch nichts unbedingt mit dem Alter zu tun. Man kann in jungen Jahren Gefühle auch wesentlich ausdrucksvoller rüberbringen (siehe z.B. Valentine oder andere junge deutsche Künstlerinnen) und vor allem den Hörer berühren. Naja in der heutigen Musikwelt überrascht mich nichts mehr."
5,Also ich kann nur sagen ich hab's nicht bereut dass ich mir diese CD von DJ Friction gekauft habe... 18 wirklich hörenswerte Tracks die eher dem gemütlicherem Hip Hop gewidmet sind. Jetzt nach 2 Monaten höre ich mir die Disc immer noch gerne an und kann nur jedem Deutsch HipHop Fan den Kauf wärmstens empfehlen! Mehr davon bitte...
1,"Wer soll so etwas hören?? Ich kann mir nicht vorstellen, daß diese ""Band"" eine Fangemeinde hat, und wenn, scheint der IQ nicht sonderlich hoch zu sein. Jeder Kindergarten kann mit einer Gitarre, einem Bass und einem Schlagzeug mehr anfangen. GROTTENSCHLECHT!"
5,"Ich bin ein grosser Reamonnfan und freue mich darüber, dass es endlich Halleluja auf CD gibt. Natürlich mit Serpentine, ist es absolut hammergeil!"
1,"Der Score zu Herr der Ringe-Die Rückkehr des Königs bietet absolut nichts neues. Zugegeben, die Melodien aus Teil 1 sind gut. Bereits in Die Zwei Türme wurden diese jedoch wiederverwertet. Bot der zweite Score zur fantastischen Trilogie noch ein paar Neuheiten wie Die Reiter von Rohan, tischt uns Howard Shore nun ein Komplett-Recycling auf. Selbst die Oscar-Juroren konnte anscheinend nichts neues finden und spielten bei der Verleihung das altbekannte Thema aus Teil 1. doch auch sie verfielen dem HdR Wahn und Shore gewann den Musik-Oscar. WOFÜR? Ich versuche wirklich objektiv zu sein... die Filme sind sehr gut und auch die Musik aus dem ersten Teil braucht sich nicht zu verstecken. Das, was neu ist ist nichts weiter als bombastischer Brei. Einziger Lichtblick , der fantastische Song Into the West Dafür ein Stern"
1,das album war nicht auf lager habe das geld zurück bekommen aber bin sehr enttäuscht darüber dass es dann zum kauf freigegeben war. wenn nicht vorhanden
1,"es gibt doch tatsächlich eine neue Scheibe von Elli,der nächste Megaflop ist unterwegs,alle Versuche sie mainstreamtauglicher zu machen,auch optisch scheitern kläglich.Ein dünner Song mit null Wiedererkennungswert,grauenhaft.Who is Elli???"
1,"Was soll diese Abzocke, liebe Andrea Berg ?? Gleiches Programm wie vor 1 Jahr + 1 (!) zusätzlicher Titel. Glaubt sie wirklich die Käufer sind blöd und unterstützen das. Ich find das einfach UNGLAUBLICH ! 0 Sterne fuer diese Frechheit"
4,"Als der Hardcore-Punk mitte der Achtziger eine gewisse Eigendynamik bekam und viele Bands der zunehmend gewaltbereiteren Szene den Rücken kehrten, schien das Kapitel endgültig zu Ende zu sein. Knapp 25 Jahre später sind es Venomous Concept die den Geist des ausgeschlachteten HC wiederbeleben und dabei mit Poisoned Apple eine beachtliche Reminiszenz in petto haben und den Old School Hardcore/Crust-Punk in seiner Urform zelebrieren - dringend, notwendig und ungestüm. Poisoned Apple vereinigt langjährige Erfahrung und Integrität der einzelnen Bandmitglieder (Shane Embury &amp; Danny Herrera (Napalm Death), Kevin Sharp &amp; Danny Lilker (u.a. Brutal Truth)), atmet dabei den ehrlichen, aggressiven und unverblümten Charakter einer Bewegung, die zur Emanzipation einer Jugendkultur wurde. xdevx.wordpress.com"
1,"Ich denke Deutschland hat langsam genug von Sido und seine Kompanen. Die Single ist genau so schlecht wie all die vorigen. Ich selbst bin kein großer Fan von Rap Musik, aber es nervt mich wenn ihre Musik über deren Bildschirm flattert. Außerdem hört sich alles gleich an. Ob ihr nun die Single kauft oder irgendeine andere, macht keinen Unterschied. Ich würde euch persönlich aufjedenfall von dem Kauf dieser Single abraten."
2,"Für mich ein zu großes Durcheinander an Soul, R'n'B, Hip Hop, Rap, Dance, Rock und Elektro!  Ich finde keinen roten Faden, alles sehr aneinander gereiht. Die Melodien kommen viel zu kurz und das Gerede von z.B. Will I Am oder auch Kelis selber, den Gastrappern nerven sehr schnell. Teenies haben daran sicher ihre Freude.  Waren vor allem ""Kaleidoscope"" und ""Tasty"" gelungene Alben, vor allem unter den Einfluss der Neptunes, so ist mir hier zu viel ""verwurschtelt"".  19 Songs? Auch zu viel....sofern so ein Durcheinander vorherrscht, vor allem Songs wie ""Aww, sh***"" oder ""Handful"" sind für mich nur kurze Lückenfüller, zu viel Rap einfach. Kelis hätte so eine gute Stimme. Die kommt in toll produzierten Songs wie ""Trilogy"" oder ""Weekend"" mal kurz hervor, diese Songs sind auch wirklich kelis-like. Auch ""Blindfold me"" oder ""Bossy"" sind hörbar und gegen Ende die Songs ""Goodbyes""  und ""Living proof"", aber ansonsten gibt es nicht viel schönes zu hören.  Für mich defintiv: Zu wenig Melodie!"
5,"WOW! Ich hab das Album auf Repeat!  Jeder Fan der beiden sollte diese CD in seinem Regal haben!!!! Absoluter Pflichtkauf! Ich hatte noch nie, dass mir alle Tracks auf einer CD 100 pro gefallen, aber mit dieser CD ist es passiert!!!"
4,"Die beiden Scheiben generell sind absoluter Kult, da braucht man keine großen Worte zu verlieren. Das Debüt-Album ""Fistfull of Metal"" war zu seiner Zeit schon soundtechnisch eine schwächere Produktion, leider ist dies mit modernen Mitteln nicht wenigstens ein wenig aufpoliert worden. Diese erste aus dem Doppelpack ist vermutlich die CD mit dem schlechtesten Sound, die ich je erworben habe, das erfordert schon ein wenig Geduld mit einem EQ oder anderen Mitteln, da wenigstens noch etwas rauszuholen."
5,So als ich das Album das 1. mal in der hand hatte war ich schon überrascht über die geile aufmachung.Aber gut das is auch egal.das album is einfach fett!!
1,"Immer wieder, als Einzelaufnahme oder in eine Box aufgenommen, läuft mir diese Aufnahme über den Weg. Normalerweise finde ich einen Stern zu vergeben, denn jeder Künstler verdient Respekt und Kunst ist Anstrenung, die man nicht unterschätzen sollte. Diese Aufnahme aber erregt meinen Ärger. An erste Stelle will ich gar nicht setzen, dass mich diese Aufnahme dieses wunderbaren Stücks langweilt. An erster Stelle soll stehen, dass hier ein Knabe verheizt wird. Sebastian Hennig hat sicher einen netten Knabensopran, aber ist mit dieser Partie deutlich überfordert. Nicht nur, dass ihm,natürlich, ohne Vorwurf, technische Möglichkeiten nicht zur Verfügung stehen, wie etwa die Pralltriller im ersten Sopransolo. Die Stimme ist schlicht zu dünn. Man sollte dafür eine Sopranstimme einsetzen, auch wenn diese nicht so voluminös sein muss wie die der Marshall in der Abbado-Aufnahme. Die Aufnahme von 1983 war damals schon keine vertretbare Alternative. Traurig, vielleicht auch ärgerlich, dass Jacobs keinen adäquateren Partner in dieser Aufnahme hat. Nicht, dass ich eigentlich Counterstimmen bei diesem Stück bevorzugen, aber es ist ein vertretbare Variante, insbesondere, wenn man sich für eine schlanke Interpretation in historischer Spielweise entscheidet. Wenn ich an James Bowman oder Michael Chance denke, ist es in Ordnung. Auch die Interpretation von Jacobs gefällt mir sehr gut. Er hatte eine sehr gut anhörbare Counter-Stimme, und das zu einer Zeit, als Counter -Singen noch keinesfalls so verbreitet war, wie viele Jahre später. Jacobs trifft den melancholischen Ton mit seiner Stimme ausgezeichnet. Umso trauriger/ärgerlicher, dass Jacobs in dieser Kombination auftritt. Wer hat die Besetzungsentscheidung getroffen ?  Ich weiss es nicht, aber vor dieser Aufnahme warne ich."
5,"Den vorhergehenden Komentaren ist eigentlich nicht viel hinzuzufügen, außer daß es einen wirklich  wundert, daß diese Scheibe fertig abgemischt 27 Jahre in einer Schublade fristen mußte, bis sie endlich dem Zuhörer ihre ganze Genialität offenbaren durfte! Grandios: wunderbare Melodien mit schönem Dub gepaart, ein wirklich schöner Hörgenuß!!! Unbedingt kaufen!!!"
5,"...aber es hat sich gelohnt. Das neue Album von Molotov ist im Vergleich zu den Vorgängeralben insgesamt rockiger, doch die Mexikaner sind ihrem Stil treu geblieben. Wieder nehmen sie kein Blatt vor den Mund und wieder bekommt man geniale Musik die einfach Stimmung verbreitet. Bereits der erste Song ""Dance and dense denso"" rockt gewaltig. Die weiteren Nummern sind mal schneller mal ruhiger und bringen Abwechslung ins Album. Besonders ""Frijolero"" sticht heraus, eine gigantischer Song welcher für den ein oder anderen etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig sein könnte. Der einzige Wehrmutstropfen ist ""Hit me (Gimme tha power II)"" Dieser ist kein würdiger Nachfolger für den hervorragenden Titel ihres ersten Albums.  Aber trotzdem haben Molotov volle fünf Sterne für ihre Scheibe verdient und ich gönne ihnen den Erfolg, den sie hoffentlich haben werden."
5,"Wer dieses absolut geniale Westcaost Rap Album noch nicht hat ist selber schuld.Besser gehts wohl kaum.Kein Wunder,daß Richie Rich schon als neuer Tupac gefeiert wurde,denn bessere und härtere Rhymes und Beats werdet ihr wohl nirgendwo finden."
5,"Nevio hat eine super tolle Stimme mit so viel Gefühl! Das Album wird super werden! Er hätte es verdient der Superstar zu werden!ICh freu mich, dass er endlich ein Album rausbringt! Natürlich werde ich es mir bestellen! Er kann so viel mit seiner Stimme machen!"
1,"Mir langts. Und es ist auch nicht das Thema, daß Entombed nicht mehr so klingen wie auf ihren ersten beiden Alben. Hollowman, Wolverine Blues und To Shoot... waren überragende Alben, die sich vor allem durch starke Songs und ein hohes Level an Qualität und Originalität hervorgetan haben. Aber nach dem Offenbarungseid ""Same Difference"" kam leider kein Album der Band heraus, was ohne Vorbehalte, Einschränkungen, ""mit viel Liebe"" durchgehend gut war. Die sehr gute When In Sodom EP hat Hoffnung gemacht, daß es nun wieder aufwärts gehen könnte. Schöner, räudiger Old-School Sound, gute Songs, ein kräftig bellender LG Petrov -&gt; Serpent Saints hätte DAS Album sein können, was alles wieder gut gemacht hat und es hat es nicht. Es hat lediglich bestätigt, daß die Band ohne die Kreativköpfe Nicke Andersson und Uffe Cederlund offensichtlich aufgeschmissen ist. Als besondere Frechheit empfinde ich es, daß auf dem ohnehin sehr kurzen Album der Song When In Sodom erneut verwurstet wurde. So kommt man für die  Kohle auf gerade mal etwas über eine halbe Stunde an neuem Material. Und dafür 4 Jahre warten?"
5,"Die erste richtige Metalplatte, die ich von einer Freundin zu hören bekam, war Avantasia, spätestens zu diesem Zeitpunkt war Metal für mich interessant geworden und als ich herausfand, dass der liebe Herr Sammet auch eine eigene Band hat, gab es kein Halten mehr: Verschiedene Songs wurden angehört und fanden begeistertes Echo! Zu dieser CD:  Besondere Highlights sind für mich ""Mysteria"", ""The piper never dies"", We don't need a hero"" und""Down to the devil"", die einfach einen geilen Sound haben und in der Melodie sehr eingängig sind.  ""King of fools"" schätze ich besonders wegen des Textes ;) Eher enttäuschend fand ich ""The spirit will remain"", selbst als Seiteneinsteiger und Halbzeitmetaller ist mir das Lied zu schnulzig, wie schon in anderen Rezensionen zu lesen, kann Tobias Sammet bessere Balladen schreiben! Insgesamt kann ich aus eigener Erfahrung sagen, dass sich dieses Album als Einstieg für bisher Nicht-Metal-Fans auf jeden Fall eignet und nach kurzer Zeit einen extremen Suchtfaktor darstellt :)!"
2,"Eigentlich würde es funktionieren. Der neue Sänger macht seine Arbeit mehr als gut und ersetzt den genialen Jorn Lande zwar nicht ohne Abzüge, ist aber ein würdiger Nachfolger. Auch Mike Terrana an den Drums macht seine Arbeit wirklich gut und ersetzt in dieser Hinsicht den ebenfalls gegangenen Ulli K. Was er aber nicht ersetzen kann, sind die Songwriter Qualitäten die Ulli mit nach Masterplan gebracht hatte. Und genau in diesem Punkt krankt das mittlerweile 3. Masterplan Album ganz gewaltig. Es fehlen einfach die packenden Songstrukturen, die genialen Ideen, die kompromisslose Härte des Erstlings. Viele Lieder dümpeln im Mittelmaß, darunter Watching the World, Heart of Darkness, Call the Gypsy, und Enemy. Kaum zu glauben, dass hier die selbe Truppe am Werk war, die Soulburn und Crystal Night geschrieben haben. Einige wenige Songs können mitreißen, nämlich der Opener Warriors Cry und Trust in You. In die melodische Sparte und ebenfalls noch ganz hörenswert fallen Lost and Gone und Keeps me Burning. Der Rest dümpelt wie gesagt im Mittelfeld herum und weiß nicht zu überzeugen. Masterplan ohne Jorn? Es hätte gelingen können, aber leider fehlen die guten Songs und somit keine Kaufempfehlung. Einsteigern sei des Debüt Masterplans empfohlen, sowie der Nachfolger Aeronautics."
1,"Es gibt einen Punkt an dem man aufhören sollte. Nach ""No More Tears"" hätte Ozzy den Hut nehmen sollen. Aber nein. Frau Sharon schiebt den Goldesel von einer Peinlichkeit in die nächste. Es war schon schlimm genug, dass sich Ozzy mit seiner Real Life TV Show selbst ans Denkmal gepisst hat aber nun zwingt Sharon ihn auch noch den eigenen Urin zu trinken. Und raus kommt: Black Rain."
5,"mal wieder... ist TTF ganz weit vorne! die song auswahl ist diesmal ziemlich gut und es gibt sogar 3,4 hammer songs. wie z.B. cd 1 song 6 und 7. das sind richtige geile songs! sonst ist die erste cd mit paar songs ausgestattet die man schon von anderen compilations kennt. die zweite cd ist eher so mit underground trance ausgestattet wo auch so mehr bass mit bei ist! aber wiegesagt die ohrwürmersongs sind eher so auf cd 1!!!!!!"
5,"Zugegeben : das neue Album von Marius ist ein bisschen gewöhnungsbedürftig. Doch bei genauem und mehrmaligem Hinhören versteht man die Texte, die sich zum Teil mit dem Terror in letzter Zeit beschäftigen.  Es ist halt typisch Westernhagen - er provoziert mit seinen Texten, schockiert, um den Hörer auf gewisse Umstände hinzuweisen. Natürlich kann die CD nicht nur Kracher beinhalten, aber alles in allem ist es wieder einmal ein gelungenes Album. Vielleicht tritt er ja auch wieder live auf..."
1,"15 Jahre hat es gedauert. Und eigentlich hätte es nie passieren müssen. Songs ohne Inhalt und Aussage sind beim ELAHE leider die Regel. Nichts für Fans, sondern nur für Menschen, die scheinbar unter Geldknappheit leidende Musiker sponsoren wollen."
2,"Ich versteh die Lobeshymnen nicht. Dieser Song ist doch mal absoluter Durchschnitt und in keinster Weise zu würdigen. Kein Refrain, der nur in Ansätzen ins Ohr geht, das typische Schwingen des Hinterns, aber das reicht leider nicht. Meines Achtens eher ein Rückschritt als eine Weiterentwicklung."
1,"Einfach unglaublich, mit welch einfältigem Zeug man die Menschen 30 Jahre zum Narren halten kann. Die Texte bestehen meist aus Lebensweisheiten, die offensichtlich der jeweils aktuellen Ausgabe des ""Goldenen Blattes"" entnommen wurden. Die Musik aus einem muffigen Mix aus Musikantenstadel und Pseudorock. Spießer aller Länder vereinigt euch, die Schürzenjäger liefern dazu die passenden musikalischen Versatzstücke."
5,"Auch wenn viele vielleicht meinen, Michael Hirte hätte das Supertalent nur gewonnen, weil er arm dran ist oder Dieter Bohlen nur damit Geld machen will. Ich habe die CD gekauft! Michael Hirte ist mit fast 73% der Sieger dieses Wettbewerbs geworden. Genauso gut hätte es auch der mit HIV infizierte Carlos Fassanelli werden können. Aber komischerweise konnte der nicht mithalten. Und klar: Bohlen wird damit sein Geld verdienen. Aber einer tut es sowieso. Und ob es nun Bohlen oder ein anderer ist, ist doch egal. Ich finde, Michael Hirte hat den Sieg verdient und ich gönne es ihm von ganzem Herzen! Nun zur CD: Ich finde die Lieder allesamt total klasse! Gerade jetzt zu Weihnachten gehen einem die Lieder besonders zu Herzen. Mein Lieblingstitel: ""You raise me up""."
5,Dieses Album ist einfach das beste von Pink was ich bis jetzt gehört habe. Freue mich aber auch schon auf das kommende namens Funhouse!!!
2,Den mit Wreath Of Barbs eingeschlagenen Weg verfolgt Mastermind Rudy Ratzinger mit Bone Peeler (leider) konsequent weiter - den Weg in die Belanglosigkeit !
4,Ehrlichgesagt bin ich ein kleines bisschen enttäuscht. Nach dem Einstieg in die Welt von Amon Tobin mit Out From Out Where konnte ich weder an seinen älteren Werken noch an den neuen soviel Gefallen finden als an dem unglaublichen kosmischen Trip.
1,"So leid mirs tut, erste cd is soso ok, aber zweite total am sack. Ich glaub nich dass beim abspielen dieser CD irgendein Club tobt. Echt nischd das wahre! peace out"
5,"Jimmy Rogers, Gitarrist der legendären Muddy Waters Band der 50er Jahre, gab 1960 das Musikerdasein auf und versuchte sich in anderen Jobs. Mit ""Sloppy Drunk"" startete er 1973 ein Comeback, und was für eins! Auf dem in Frankreich eingespielten Album wird er begleitet von den Aces, der legendären Begleitband von Little Walter, ergänzt um Willie Mabon am Piano. Herausgekommen ist eines der schönsten Chicago-Blues-Alben, die ich kenne."
2,Also auch wenn ich mich hiermit vom Großteil abhebe muß ich sagen das diese Platte nicht der Überhammer ist wie sie überall angeprießen wird...Der Titel Song und Hallowed be thy name sind Klassiker...aber ansonsten ? Gangland...Invaders...totale Ausfälle...Run to the hills...für mich schon immer ein Song a la I was made for lovin you...Disco-Metal... aber halt meine Meinung... Wems gefällt..ich liebe die Rauhe Phase mit Paul Di'Anno halt lieber!
5,"Mit der 4ten Nachtschicht Auflage ist den beiden Machern ein Glücksgriff gelungen wie ich finde. Eine gelungene Mischung von Hip Hop bis zu House. Meine lieblings Tracks sind Alone with the TV,Darf ich das behalten und Vorbei. Fazit:Eine schöne Mischung für den ruhigen Abend, reinschauen lohnt sich!"
5,"ich bin durch den TV-Spot auf Paul Potts, den sympathischen Kerl mit der Gänsehautstimme, aufmerksam geworden und hab mir dann die CD gekauft. Kaum angekommen wurde sie sofort abgespielt und für super befunden. Schöne Titel, gesungen mit einer grandiosen Stimme, wow!!!!! Kann sie nur weiterempfehlen."
5,"endlich ist sie wieder da, die edith piaf der neuzeit: patricia kaas!!!! mit einem weiteren album der superlative verschönert sie uns das nahende weihnachtsfest. wie nicht anders zu erwarten, ist auch dieses album voll von wahren und tiefen gefühlen. es erzählt von schmerz und trauer, reue und angst.aber sexe fort wäre kein patricia kaas album, wäre da nicht irgendwo zwischen den zeilen ein lichtblick, dass das, was vor uns liegt schön und hoffnungsvoll sein wird.einfach eine aufforderung, weiter zu machen und das leben mit all seinen facetten zu leben und zu lieben. danke patricia kaas für dieses wunderschöne werk.........."
2,"Ich bin schon seit eh und je Robbie Fan, mochte aber nicht immer all seine Musik. Sein letztes Album ""Intensive Care"" fand ich super und ich kann es so gut wie auswendig. Daher habe ich auch ohne zu zögern sein neues Album gekauft. Und ich bereue ist zutiefst!! Sowas furchtbares habe ich schon lange nicht mehr gehört! Hier hat man den Eindruck, das ist ein Album der Pet Shop Boys und nicht von Robbie Williams! Das einzig gute Lied ist ""Lovelight"", alles andere konnte ich nicht mal bis zum Ende anhören, weil ich Ohrenschmerzen bekam. Ich hoffe, dass bei aller Experementierfreude das nächste Album wieder hörbarer wird. Aber es ist schon interessant wie hier die Meinungen doch auseinander gehen, wenn man auch die anderen Rezessionen liest!"
4,"Von der aktuellen Comeback Single gefällt mir nur die Techno Version auf der Maxi CD. Die normale Radio Version finde ich unspektakulär. Gott sei Dank gibt es auf dem Album auch noch andere Stilrichtungen. Für jeden etwas dabei. Bei ""Maybe"" wurde von Aerosmith ""Come Together"" abgekupfert. Wer den Armageddon Soundtrack kennt, weiß wovon ich rede. Einen Stern habe ich abgezogen, weil mir vor allem die Comeback Single überhaupt nicht gefällt."
5,"Für mich stellt Transgression das Best of Album von Fear Factory da, 540,000 Fahrenheit hätte auch auf Demanufacture gepasst,genauso wie Echo of my scream (A Tragedy of pain lässt grüßen), New Promise wäre auch gut auf Archetype gekommen. Was mir aber am besten an diesen Album gefällt, sind die Solos, FF Sound mit Solos wie geil ist das denn, Supernova ist ein Meisterwerk. Genauso wie die beiden Cover Songs, Millennium ist ja richtig böse Killing Joke! Das alleine rechtfertig die 5 Punkte, wenn nicht sogar 6."
5,"Fear Factory sind nicht mehr das, was sie mal waren - gottseidank, wie ich meine! Die Jungs haben seit dem Ausstieg von Dino Cazares jede Menge dazugelernt. Wo früher wütendes, brachiales Dahinknattern angesagt war gibt es jetzt größere, stimmungsvollere Melodiebögen, allerdings noch immer in Songs verpackt, die eindeutig das Label ""Heavy Metal"" tragen. Für mich ist diese Scheibe die konsequente Weiterentwicklung der Band - vieles, was Fans an Fear Factory seit jeher gut finden hört man noch immer, gepaart mit dem Mut zu Neuem."
5,"Poisonblack ist nunmehr das Hauptprojekt von Sänger Ville Laihiala - ehemaliger Frontmann der Gruppe Sentenced. Wenn man traurig war, dass sich die Band aufgelöst hat, dann kann man beherzt zum neuen Poisonblack-Album greifen. Klasse Melodien, gewohnte Texte - alles passt. Ville singt immer noch und einen großen Unterschied zur Vorgängerband konnte ich nicht finden! Allerdings ist ""Lust Stained Despair"" nicht mit dem Debut-Album von Poisonblack zu vergleichen. Während das Vorgängeralbum noch sehr ruhig klang, geht es hier wieder gut zur Sache! Das lob ich mir!"
5,das ist mal wieder der krönende abschluss des jahres 2001. ein einfach geniales album - sowohl alle bereiche werden bedient - von ziemlich heftig bis supersanft. eben einfach creed - superklasse! weiter so!
4,"Auf die Pinkies ist eindeutig Verlass! Auch das aktuelle Album glänzt wieder mit etlichen Melodic Metal Perlen aus deutschen Landen. Gleich der Titeltrack macht deutlich wo's hier lang geht: Pfundige Grooves, Ohrwurmmelodien, ein Bombensound der keine Wünsche offen läßt, und über allem thront die tolle Stimme von David Readman, welcher seinen Vorgänger Andi Deris (jetzt HELLOWEEN) schon vor langer Zeit vergessen machte. Und was Alfred Koffler mit seinem gesundheitlichen Handycap auf der Gitarre abzieht nötigt einem Respekt ab. Anspieltipps zu nennen fällt bei 'Thunderdome' ungemein schwer, da die Scheibe wie aus einem Guss daher kommt und einfach nur einen Höllenspass macht! Einzig den tausendmal gehörten &amp; nervigen Cover-Song ""My Sherona"" hätte man sich getrost sparen können.  Wer also schon immer auf die Band stand bzw. eigentlich jeder Freund von qualitativ hochwertigem Melodic Metal sollte - nein muß hier zugreifen! Und wer die Gelegenheit hat die Truppe auf ihrer Double Headliner Tour zusammen mit AXXIS zu sehen, darf sich dies auf keinen Fall entgehen lassen."
5,"Highland is a very good ""band"", and has a good music. I've got all the albums from Highland!"
2,"Schönes Stück...gut und schön..... Nette Stimme.....gut und schön.... Kennt noch jemand das Original von Marcella Detroit?? Das erschien etwa in der Mitte der 90er.... und nun das??? Wo sind die glasklaren, hohen Töne aus dem Original hin?? Das versucht mal wieder jemand in Höhen vorzudringen, die absolut unerreichbar sind, und leider hört man das..... Ok, ansonsten schönes Stück und nette Stimme, aber mehr auch nicht, daher nur 2 Sterne....."
4,JOANNA ZIMMER ist die Neuendeckung 2005. Mit ihrer ersten Single I BELIEVE überzeugte sie die Nation und landete einen riesen Hit bis auf Platz 2 der Charts. Nun erscheint die 2te Single und wieder ist es eine Ballade. Traumhaft schöner Song wie ich finde. Nur schade das es eine Ballade ist. Hätte gern mal was anderes gehört von Ihr.
1,"4 Lieder auf dieser CD sind alle schon mal dagewesen! Blue System lässt grüssen. Ich finde es eine Frechheit, einfach alte Songs rauszukramen und diese mit jungen Sängern wieder aufzunehmen - und dann auch noch behaupten es seien neue Titel. In keinem einzigen Interview wird erwähnt, dass es aufgewärmte Songs sind. Mir tun die Superstar Kandidaten mittlerweile nur noch leid, sie werden benutzt und verar*. Schade, denn manche haben echt Talent (Juliette) Ein Stern ist noch zuviel!"
2,"Also okay, mal das positive zuerst: Hey die können ja teilweise echt gut singen (Daniel is Geschmackssache), das is ja schonmal eine gute Grundlage. Allerdings was Dieter dann daraus macht ist für mich etwas unverständlich. Ich meine wenn das hier Superstars sein oder werden wollen, dann müssen sie auch noch ordentliche Musik dazu machen. Aber es ist wie immer das selbe Prinzip, ein altes Lied von sich selbst nehmen und es irgendwie mit leicht verändertem Text unterlegen, ich denke, so lässt sich das album sicherlich gut vermarkten. Hey ja es scheint echt zu klappen, die Teenies kaufen doch echt alles. Okay ich hab das akbum auch nicht, aber die ersten beiden Singles und die Hörproben deuten darauf hin das das ganze album eine ziemlich billige Produktion ist.Aber naja was solls...das dumme is nur, solange Dieter noch reicher wird, dann bleibt uns solche musik wohl nicht erspart. Und jetzt nochmal was an alle die dieses Album so über alles loben: Wie kann man etwas so vergöttern, was  - es schonmal fast in der gleichen Form so gab - sich nicht von der Masse absetzen kann (in sachen qualität, gekauft wirds trotzdem mehr) - ich nicht verstehen kann, das einige so naiv sind und sagen, das popmusik das einzig wahre ist und diese cd perfekt sei.  Also ich bitte euch, die Musik wird doch schon so lange immerwieder durch den wolf gedreht und nur ganz wenig verändert, das ihr euer geld für sowas noch rausschmeisst, ist für mich unvorstellbar."
4,"Mit einem Nicht-Fan meine ich kein Britney-Hater sondern einen Standpunkt aus objektiver Sicht. Zu den einzelnen Liedern: 1.) Gimme More (4/5) Die erste Single des Albums. Man merkt, Britney hat einen Soundwechsel hinter sich. Der Sound ist dancebar, sehr flott und mit Verlaub ein Ohrwurm. Ganz abgesehen von ihrem Auftritt bei den VMA's zeigt sich dieser Song als sehr neuer Stil Britney's. Die Audioeffekte sind Geschmackssache. Leider kann Gimme More schnell nervig werden! 2.) Piece Of Me (5/5) Wieder ein unglaublicher Song, meiner Meinung nach noch besser als Gimme More. Der Refrain zeigt sich als Ohrwurm. Die Audioeffekte/Stimmveränderung und der elektronische Beat sind auch Geschmackssache! 3.) Radar (5/5) Der ganze Beat sehr elektronisch,Refrain mal wieder Ohrwurm. Wieder mal Stimmveränderungen bzw. Audioeffekte. 4.) Break The Ice (5/5) Sehr geiler Sound, geile Melodie, Song einach geil. Der Bridge ist der Hammer, sowie der Refrain mal wieder ein voller Ohrwurm ist, den jeder nach maximal 5-mal hören auswendig kann! 5.) Break The Ice (3/5) Zieht sich sehr lange hin, fast 5 Minuten! Wird leider sehr schnell langweilig... Erinnert ein bisschen an Gwen Stefani.  6.) Get Naked (I Got A Plan) (2/5) Zwar sehr interessant, aber der Part des Mannes ist doch sehr lange. Zwar einige Stellen, die wirklich gut gelungen sind, aber der Song an sich doch eher ""Mist"". 7.) Freakshow (5/5) Sehr geil von Anfang an! Reißt einen richtig mit. Hört sich erst sehr anders als die anderen Lieder an, ist aber richtig gut! Sehr witzig/lustig/interessant ist Britney's Stimme auf Mannsstimme getrimmt. 8.) Toy Soldier (4/5) Sehr R'n'B mäßig getrimmt. Sehr geil ist die Überleitung und der Refrain ist auch Hammer Geil! Gegen Ende klingt es ziemlich nach Missy Elliot's Song ""Gossip Folks"". Trotzdem guter Song! 9.) Hot As Ice (5/5) Absolutes Lieblingslied meinerseits! Von Anfang ist und muss man voll dabei sein um diesen Song richtig mitzubekommen. Sehr geil und niedlich finde ich Britney's ""Break it down"" xD  10.) Ooh Ooh Baby (5/5) Erinnert an Liebeslied am Anfang ist jedoch nicht so langweilig wie Heaven on Earth. Endlich auch mal ein Song in dem fast bzw. keine Stimmveränderung von Britney vorhanden ist. 11.) Perfect Lover (4/5) Der Song versetzt einen so richtig in Trance, besonders gegen Ende! Am Anfang denkt man noch, es wäre ein ziemlich durchschnittlicher Song, der Refrain kommt dann jedoch sehr hypotisierend. Das ""Gestöhne"" trägt auch seinen Teil dazu bei xD 12.) Why Should I Be Sad (5/5) Der Song, der mit Kevon Federline, ihrem Ex-Mann abrechnet. Wenn man genau auf Brit's Stimme hört, merkt man auch, dass sie emotional dabei ist. Trotzdem, es ist eher ein ""Ich gehe meinen Weg ohne dich"" als ""Ich mach dich fertig du dummes Scheißkind"" xD Trotzdem gut gemacht.  Britney hat nur zu 2 Songs beigetragen, nämlich ""Freakshow"" und ""Ooh Ooh Baby"". Sehr schade, ich hätte eher gedacht, jetzt kommt ein Album, in dem sie über mehr Autobiographisches schreibt. Jedoch sind nur zwei Songs autobiographisch. Trotzdem geiles tanzbares Album, obwohl noch ein, zwei Balladen dem Album gut getan hätten. Schließlich ist 12 nicht die begrenzte Zahl Audio Tracks die auf eine Audio CD draufpassen. Auch enttäuschend die viel zu häufige Stimmveränderung. Trotzdem gelungenes Comeback. Abschließend noch was zu dem Satz ""Das beste Album ihrer bisherigen Karriere"": Meine Favoriten sehen so aus: 1.) Britney 2.) Blackout 3.) In The Zone 4.) Oops!... I Did It Again 5.) ...Baby One More Time Kaufen sollten sich die Leute das Album, die es interessiert. Ob man Fan ist oder nicht, ist unwichtig. Sonst wäre das ja eine Katastrophe. Man sollte Britney's Eskapaden und Skandale einfach mal beiseite schieben und auf die Lieder hören. Und die könnte vielen Gefallen, da das Album sehr viel bietet.  Das war's, ich hoffe diese Rezension war hilfreich."
2,"Ich möchte ja nicht zuviele Wörter über dieses Album verlieren, denn das wäre mehr als es verdient hat. Und das sage ich als jemand, der diese Band jahrelang vergöttert hat und jeden kreativen Spagat erst abgelehnt und dann zutiefst verinnerlicht hat. Die meisten Songs hätten gut auf eine B-Seite von Ratlle &amp; Hum - Singles gepaßt. Das beste, was man sagen kann, ist: Manche Songs sind ja ganz nett und passen gut als Hintergrundbeschallung in eine beliebigen 30something-Kneipe. ""Vertigo"" kommt noch hart und prägnant, aber schon ""Miracle Drug"" finde ich ziemlich nervig, ja berechnend. Da wird eine Suppe aus altbewährten Zutaten zusammengemixt, auf daß es auch wirklich möglichst vielen gefallen werde. Ja, und die anderen Lieder kann man sich ja anhören, man kanns aber auch sein lassen! Auch ""love &amp; peace"" kommt viel zu spät in die Pötte - davor wird keine Spannung aufgebaut, sondern Quark breitgetreten. Auf Amazon und im Itunes shop steht als Hinweis: Kunden die diese Platte kauften, kauften auch die neue von R.E.M. und Coldplay - noch so zwei Langeweile-Alben. Ich nehme an, daß dies einfach aus dem Mangel an bekannten Alternativen geschieht. Deswegen möchte ich hiermit einfach mal ein paar alternative Namen nennen für alle, die die gute Musik suchen, wie auch U2 sie mal gemacht hatten: Ben Harper! JAMES! Eels! Moneybrother!  Und nochmals: BEN HARPER!!! Katholisch, ernsthaft, gefühlvoll. Und kann besser Gitarre spielen als Bono und Edge zusammen. O.k. Genug. Ein bißchen Werbung, vielleicht auch zur Freude von Amazon..."
1,"Na ja, man hört sich manches mit sehr gemischten Gefühlen, Unbehagen an und ist durchaus nicht abgeneigt zu sagen .. Nö! Dann lieber Beatles ODER Metallica. Die Band erreicht aber keine dieser Bands auch nur annähernd! Alles in allem ist das weder Fisch, noch Fleisch. Es ist der klägliche Versuch, einem Hamstermaul ein Wolfsgebiss einzusetzen. Ist der nicht niedlich? Selbst für Intusiasten sicherlich eine harte Nuss, die es gilt, sich weich-zu-hören. Der Gesang, wenn ich das so sagen darf, könnte auch von meinem Nachbarn in der Badewanne geträllert worden sein. Wo soll das nach Hetfield klingen? Ein Folk Music-Barde(höchstens), mehr nicht. Der einzigste Lichtblick waren vereinzelte Gitarrenriffs, welche mich wieder zum hinhören bewegten. Absolut keine Kaufempfehlung .. sehr unfertiges Werk einer Spassband."
5,"Beim Stöbern bei Amazon habe ich diese CD entdeckt, die mich gleich mal 20 Jahre in die Vergangenheit katapultiert hat. Total süße Lieder von Frank Zander, die ich noch aus meiner Kindheit kenne. Klasse nach Jahren endlich mal wieder den Ententanz und die anderen Songs zu hören"
5,"ACHTUNG : Endlich gibt es die Gesamtausgabe ALLER Songs der Cream (live und studio) auf 4 CD's. Es wäre um jeden Titel schade, den Sie von Baker, Bruce  &amp; Clapton verpassen ! Titel der 4-CD-Box : ""Those Were The Days"""
5,"Super traditionelle Folksongs in eigener Interpretation.  Arrangements klasse und dazu zwei Super-Sängerinnen, Maddy Prior und  Gay Woods, wobei mir persönlich Gay besser gefällt (Geschmackssache).  Die Scheibe ist ein Kleinod, das man getrost durchlaufen lassen kann.  Anspieltip: ""Lowlands of Holland""."
1,"Nikka Costa hat hier ein tolles Album abgeliefert, welches ich mit 4 bis 5 Sternen bewerte würde wenn es nicht ein Problem gäbe: Die CD ist Kopiergeschützt &gt; daher KEINE Kaufempfehlung!"
4,"Im UK erscheinen auch heute noch Single/Maxi CDs, hierzulande gibt es Singles ja kaum noch auf CD sondern nur noch als Download zu kaufen. Die UK Single enthält den Bonus Track der nur auf der amazon.de Edition von ZEITGEIST enthalten ist. Leider fehlen aber die anderen Bonus Tracks der dubiosen Special Editions des Albums (""Zeitgeist"" und ""Stellar""). 1. Tarantula   2. Death from above"
4,"Nachdem die letzten beiden Scheiben von Manowar wohl eher als durchwachsen zu bezeichnen waren, habe ich mich natürlich auf das Comeback von Ross gefreut.  Sicherlich bietet der neue Metal-Leader nichts bahnbrechend Neues und wie auch bei seinen Bandkollegen sind einige Ausfälle auf der CD zu verzeichnen, aber ein paar geniale Tracks wie ""I Got The Right"", ""God Of Dying"", ""We Will Kill"" und natürlich ""Immortal Son"" (Überhammer !!!) wissen dann doch zu begeistern. Im Vergleich mit Metallica sind das auf die letzten 18 Jahre gesehen immerhin vier Songs mehr....  Mit Patrick Fuchs ist ein durchaus passabler Shouter am Start, der natürlich Anleihen von Eric Adams mitbringt aber mich auch ein bisschen an David Wayne erinnert. Für den Really-True-Die-For-Metal-Manowar-Fan auf jeden Fall ein vier Sterne Album, alle anderen können ggf. einen Stern abziehen..."
2,"Fripp als Solist ist in der Regel schwer verdaulich. Die immer wieder ähnlichen Klänge werden auf der Länge einer CD doch langweilig. Es gibt keinerlei rhythmische Elemente. Es fehlt die Abwechslung. Oder  Mitspieler, die auf die Fripp'schen Ideen eingehen und sie weiterführen. Wie zum Beispiel Brian Eno oder Theo Travis. Es fehlt an der Soße, die diese schwere Kost verdaulicher macht."
5,"Dass Philippe Herreweghe Bachs h-moll-Messe später noch einmal (für harmonia mundi) aufgenommen hat, muss man wohl so deuten, dass er mit dieser ersten Aufnahme (Minderbroederskerk Ghent, 1988) nicht ganz zufrieden war. Damit ist jedoch nicht gesagt, dass es sich hier etwa um eine schlechte Aufnahme handelt. Ganz im Gegenteil! Jedenfalls haben diese beiden CDs mir persönlich im Laufe der Jahre sehr viel Vergnügen bereitet. Die grandiose Musik wird hier bewusst ""schön"" vorgetragen: Es gibt wenig Kontraste, nichts Schroffes oder Abruptes, sondern ein Schwelgen im Schönklang des tadellosen, mit Frauenstimmen besetzten Chores (z. B. ""Sanctus"") und des historischen Instrumentariums - wobei die Aufnahmetechnik wirklich alles eingefangen hat, auch die mechanischen Geräusche des Orchesters und das Umblättern der Noten. Bei den Solisten handelt es sich um bewährte Experten für die Musik dieser Epoche; besonders möchte ich Peter Kooy hervorheben, dessen geschmeidige Stimme ideal zu dieser Interpretation passt - sein ""Quoniam tu solus Sanctus"" ist m. E. über jede Kritik erhaben. Der Altist Charles Brett singt verhältnismäßig verhalten und hätte vielleicht ein wenig mehr Unterstützung von den Tontechnikern bedurft. Die Mezzosopranistin Catherine Patriasz hat eine dunkle, aber agile Stimme; Howard Crook und Barbara Schlick sind routinierte Bachsänger, die sich nahtlos ins Gesamtbild einfügen. - Wer es kontrastreicher und prächtiger mag, wird vielleicht eher an René Jacobs' Aufnahme mit der Akademie für Alte Musik Berlin und dem RIAS-Kammerchor Gefallen finden; selbst werde ich weiterhin des öfteren Herreweghe hören, wenn auch im Bewusstsein, dass Bachs Musik so großartig ist, dass sie unterschiedliche Interpretationsansätze nicht nur zulässt, sondern geradezu fordert."
4,"Sammlung klassisch eingespielter, authentischer Tangos.  20 Titel, die man auch am Stück anhören kann, ohne daß Langeweile aufkommt."
5,"Ich bin ja eine große Oldie-Liebhaberin und weiß natürlich, daß es diesen Schlager schon 2 x gegeben hat: 1 x mit Lobo: Baby I'd love you to want me und 1 x mit Michael Holm: Baby, Du bist nicht allein. Ich finde es toll, daß Frank aus diesem Oldie auch noch eine spanische Version geliefert hat. Eine ganz tolle Version. Bei uns in Kärnten ist dieser Schlager sehr oft beim ORF zu hören. Hoffentlich gibt es noch mehr Oldies in spanischer Sprache."
4,"Dass Joakim Bergs geniale Texte nicht gerade immer Heiterkeit und Sonnenschein ausstrahlen, sind wir ja gewöhnt. Themen wie Minderwertigkeitskomplexe, schwierige Kindheit, Enttäuschung etc. wurden schon früher oft behandelt. Aber in ""Du&amp;jag döden"" gehts in vielen Liedern um Gewalt, Krankheit, Tod. Musikalisch bleibt sich Kent treu, stadiontaugliche Rocksongs und stillere Balladen in ausgewogener Mischung, mit U2-inspirierten Gitarren (besonders bei Song Nr. 7) und teilweise mit Orchester-Instrumenten verstärkt. Kent-Anhänger werden diese CD mögen, auch wenn sie meiner Meinung nicht ganz so stark ist wie ""Vapen &amp; ammunition"" oder ""Isola"". Alle Texte gibt es übrigens zum Nachlesen auf kent.nu, und auch wenn die Musik fett rockt, bleibt einem die wahre Qualität der Songs verborgen, wenn man kein Schwedisch kann..."
1,"Mal ganz ehrlich. Mir fehlen die Drei???. Ich weiß nicht, was sich die macher von den Drei??? mit der Serie ""Die Dr3i"" erhoffen.  An den Drei??? reicht diese neue Serie lange nicht mehr dran. Ich zähle dies auch nicht zu den Drei??? es ist einfach zu schlecht. Die Namsänderungen von den Deteckiven außer Bob und einfach die Namsänderung des Trios. Mal ganz im Ernst. Es soll Probleme mit dem Namen ""Die Drei???"" gegeben haben? Fällt denen aber spät ein. Ab Folge 60 der Drei??? wurde die Serie nur in Deutschland weiter geführt. In Amerika wurde sie abgesetzt. Unter dem gleichen Namen. Und nach 10 Jahren kommt auf einmal ein Problem mit dem Namen der Serie. Unglaubwürdig. Erst gibt es Probleme mit dem Covername ""Alfred Hitchcock"". Das wurde weg genommen. Und dann doch noch Probleme mit den Namen der Serie? Naja, für mich wird es nur die Drei??? geben und die neue Serie ""Die Dr3i"" werde ich nie dort zuzählen. Es passt nicht zu den ""Die Drei ???"""
5,"Hammeralbum von Top-Musikern, gehört zum Favoritenkreis meiner Liebsten. Ist das Album des Jahres 2007 und kann nur, wenn überhaupt, vom nächsten die Ärzte-Album getoppt werden ! Genial verpackt, literarisch hochstehend abwechlungsreicher als Bob Dylan, AC/DC, Beatles  und wie sie alle heissen - halt die Beste Band der Welt :) Ein absolutes Muss - Live sind die neuen Songs noch ne Klasse besser, Gänsehautfeeling pur !!! Hoffentlich begleitet uns die einzig wahre Religion ""Belafarinrod"" noch viele viele Jahr durchs Leben...."
1,"Keine Frage, ""Sulang...."" war DER Hit der Karnevalssession 2004. In jeder Kneipe, Superstimmung, wirklich klasse."
1,"O.k., ich war auch mal 12 und fand alles toll, was sich irgendwie nach Aufstand oder Rebellion anhörte. Aber ich wollte und will bis heute niemanden erschiessen. Da werden den Teens von heute ja tolle Aussagen um die Ohren gehauen. Liza Li kann nicht singen. Die Musik ist auch grottig und der Text....so ein Schwachsinn. Eigendlich ist ein Stern sogar noch zu viel. Angst und Bange wird mir bei dem Gedanken, dass 10 bis 14-jährige so einen Scheiß hören. Liza, zurück in die Gosse, aus der Du (gerne) gekommen wärst. Ich glaube Dir nämlich kein Wort."
4,"Sha und jaja. Als ich dieses Lied das erstemal hörte, dachte ich - geiler Text und ein hammer Beat. Natürlich der Text ist jetzt keine Glanzleistung, aber ihre Stimme passt gut zu dem fast ""geklautem"" Beat von Ice Ice Baby. Dies ist ein Song den man einfach zwischendurch hören kann und der auch Partylaune mitbringt. Ein cooler Song!"
1,"Am treffensten hat es wohl meine Freundin beim ersten Höreindruck auf den Punkt gebracht: ""Ist das Vanessa Mae?""  Ich habe Apocalyptica gemocht, weil sie düstere schwere Musik gemacht haben, ohne dass irgendein mieses Halbhirn währenddessen ins Mikro röhrt.  Und jetzt? Statt Kesselpauken höre ich Elektrobeats. Statt dunklem Geschrammel höre ich leichtes Gefidel. Nein, nein, nein Jungs, so hab ich mir das nicht vorgestellt, da lege ich doch lieber die gute alte ""Cult"" nochmal ein - aber erst, wenn die ""Refelctions"" umgetauscht ist. Schade, das man nicht 0 Punkte vergeben kann..."
5,"Hendningarna (deutsch: Die Heiden) zeigen mit ihrem Album 'Karelia visa' auf beeindruckende Art, wie abwechslungsreich und faszinierend zugleich folkloristische Musik sein kann. Ein Besuch der Band in Karelien (ehemals ein finnischer Landesteil, der seit Kriegsende 1945 zu Russland gehört) als geschichtlicher Hintergrund für die Entstehung dieser Produktion lässt bereits erahnen, dass die Musik in eine melancholische Richtung geht. Dennoch (oder gerade deswegen?) sind die Melodien einerseits wunderschön und fast anmutig-fragil; andererseits jedoch ebenso vielfältig und durchtränkt von kraftvollen Inspirationen.  Der weibliche Gesang (mit deutlichen Einflüssen der Sangeskunst der finnischen Runen) ist passend zur kreativen Musik nicht weniger hörenswert und bietet - wenn auch vielleicht etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig - ein wunderbares und nicht alltägliches Hörerlebnis, das man einfach mal auf sich wirken lassen darf."
5,"Mit diesem Album hat das Trio aus Kanada,dass es leider schon seit nahezu 16 Jahren nicht mehr gibt,eine richtig geile Scheibe abgeliefert.Allein schon der Opener ""I live for the Weekend""(geiler Titel) hat es echt in sich. Songs wie ""In the Night""(ein echtes Meisterwerk)oder auch ""Nature's Child""(hört euch dieses Gitarrensolo an,Wahnsinn!!!!)führen diese Linie fort.Als einziger Wermutstropfen muss ich(so leid es mir auch tut), dass Instrumentalstück ""Finger Takin'anführen,dass mir doch etwas zu langweilig erscheint.Dies ist jedoch absolut kein Grund diese Scheibe nicht zu kaufen,denn die anderen Songs hauen einen echt vom Hocker.Wer diese Ausnahmeband noch nicht kennt,für den  wird es aber höchste Zeit,diese musikalische Lücke zu schließen.Ich hoffe das diese Rezension hilfreich war.Keep Rockin'."
5,"Ja, mit Crazy Town verbindet man natuerlich wohl erstmal den Bombenhit ""Butterfly"". Ein One - Hit - Wonder? Ich hoffe doch mal nicht!!! Denn auch wenn dieses Album nichts wirklich neues ist, gewohnter Crazy Town - Rock - Rap, ist es doch fuer mich als Fan beider vereinter Musikstile und Nicht - Besitzer des Vorgaengers ""The gift of the game"" ein Knaller."
2,"Okey, der Typ ist nicht so hoffnungslos talentfrei wie der überwiegende Teil der sonstigen Casting-Sternchen, aber ein Rockmusiker ist er deswegen noch lange nicht. Dazu sind die Songs einfach zu brav und vorhersehbar. Im Duett mit der Nightwish-Frontmaus hört sich der Gesang ja noch ganz hübsch an, aber solo haut das alles nicht so unbedingt vom Hocker."
1,"Er kann ja gut singen mag sein, aber wie alle dsds-fuzzis sind seine Songs nicht selber geschrieben, sondern alle irgendwelche erfundenen Liebesgeschichten die der Dieter Bohlen schreibt.... ausserdem is er ja jetz wieder total out.... Die Mädels halt.... Für ein Jahr Fan von Tokio Hotel, dann 2 Monate Tobias Regner dann wieder Tokio Hotel dann Us 5 dann Nevio dann Mike Leon Grosch ..... Alles nur Show *IS DER NICH SÜß"" lol"
1,"Mein Gott, wie schwach! Das Geld für die Single war herausgeworfenes Geld! Ich habe selten ein langweiligeres Album und eine schrecklichere, fast unhörbare Single gekauft. Ich bin von Elli total enttäuscht, hatte mir viel viel mehr versprochen. Herausgekommen sind wieder nur langweilige Rock- Gitarren- Riffs- man kann es ja nicht mehr hören. Wann begreift sie endlich, dass man sich endlich mal umorientieren muss?? Also beim besten Willen- nicht EIN Song gefällt mir!"
1,"was soll man zu einem album sagen das noch nicht drausen ist  das einzige was man bewerten könnte ist das cover und das ist ehrlich gesagt das hässlichste das ich jeh gesehen habe  madonna sieht weder frisch noch stylisch aus wie im voraus angekündigt worden ist  denke das album selber wird schon seine höhen haben bis jetzt wurde ich noch von keinem ihre 1o alben wirklich entäuscht  und das 11. wird es auch nicht tun also abwarten  und um ""4 minutes"" kann man streiten es ist nicht gerade ein meisterwek aber  hat seinen reiz sagen wir es mal so"
5,"Ja Ja Ja. Es gibt auch Gruppen die irgendwie in keine Schublade passen. Wolfpack sind das beste beispiel dafür. Ich würde diese blas(T)phemische Wut Grinding Deathpunkcrust nennen.  Die Gitarren klingen wie ein schwarm Mücken und das Schhlagzeug ballert wild durch die Gegend. Man kann sagen, ein Mix aus alte Discharge und neuer Exploited.  Wer also mal sich so richtig die Birne ausschütteln will, sollte diesen Geheimtip sich schleunigst zulegen."
5,"Ganz großes Rammstein Kino! Die Fortsetzung der Reise, Reise ist ein gelungenes Machwerk, das zwar konsequent den Stil des Vorgängers beibehält, es dabei aber nicht kopiert, sondern durchaus Eigenständig ist. Opener ist die schon als Auskopplung bekannte Nummer ""Benzin"", der zweite Song ""Mann gegen Mann"" führt zurück zu alter Härte und eindeutig zweideutigen Texten! Dieser Song wurde übrigens vom Rosenstolz Keyboarder abgesegnet und sei nicht Schwulenfeindlich!!! Der Titelsong ist eine fast schon ungewohnt epische Entführung und wird auch in Kürze als Single erscheinen. Mit ""Spring"" wieder härtere Töne anspielend führt dieser Song textlich in Lindemann-Manier in menschliche Abgründe. Man kann es als Treiben des Mobs in den Selbstmord beschreiben. Großartig! ""Wo Bist Du"" erinnert textlich an Du Hast, da ein Satz hier zeilenweise ergänzt wird und somit in eine andere Richtung geleitet wird! Ein Höhepunkt des Albums folgt mit ""Stirb Nicht Vor Mir"", eine Nummer, die ohne die typische Stimme niemals als Rammstein Song angesehen würde. Es ist ein Duett mit Sharleen Spiteri von Texas, im Deutsch-Englisch-Wechsel gesungen! Nicht 100 Prozentig eine Ballade, aber doch sehr entspannend ruhig. Assoziationen zu Nick Cave und Kylie Minogue kommen da ganz automatisch! ""Zerstören"" ist zeitlos aktuell, ob es jetzt auf die momentane Situation in den Vororten von Paris adaptiert wird, oder in jedes beliebige Fußballstadion. Auch hier wieder ein Griff zur von früher gewöhnten Härte. Ebenso wie der nächste Song ""Hilf Mir"" wie immer aus der Sicht des Täters beschrieben. Ein weiteres Highlight ist die Nummer ""Te Quiero Puta"", mit mexikanischen Bläsern angereichert. Die letzten Nummern kommen dann wieder ruhiger daher und sind weder Ballade noch Rock Song. Trotz alledem sind ""Feuer und Wasser"" und ""Ein Lied"" durchaus hörbare Lieder, wenn auch letzteres ungefähr so gewöhnungsbedürftig ist wie ""Nebel"" vom ""Mutter"" Album. Die DVD der Special Edition sei denen ans Herz gelegt, die einfach gerne die Limited Editions sammeln. Die drei Tracks der letzten Tour werden so aber auch auf der in Kürze erscheinenden DVD ""On Tour"" erhalten sein. Interessant hier, dass Rammstein sich auch der Aufnahmen von Fans bedient, und diese gekonnt in die professionell gefilmten einfügt. So wirkt man natürlich auch den Bootleggern entgegen! :-)"
5,Und damit hat egj schon am anfang des Jahres mal ein knaller rausgehauen einfach nur megageil ich weiß wer mich kennt der weiß das ich eigentlichnicht einen auf begeistert mache sondern in ruhe die alben bewerte aber das ist doch einfach mal hammer! und wenn man es mit dem streetalbum von g-hot vergleicht ist egj im kampf um den titel label nr.1 wieder ein ganzes stück vorgerutscht
1,"war früher ein absoluter Fan von Tic Tac Toe.  Habe das erste Lied nach der Zusammenkunft angehört. ""Spiegel"" hatte irgendetwas.  Der Rest ist absolut sche....e. Bereu diesen Kauf. Sie liegt wirklich nur in der Ecke rum und vergammelt."
2,"habe ONCE jetzt 5 mal komplett durchgehört aber was bei mir bleibt ist die Erkenntniss, dass ist nicht NIGHTWISH wie ich sie kennen und lieben gelernt habe. Eine schlecht abgemischte CD, stark zurückgefahrene Stimme von Tarja, einen kaum hörbaren Tuomas, teilweise monotones Gitarrengeschrubbe...und die Krönung eine fast allgegenwärtige Kreischstimme von Marco, dem neuen Bassisten. Junge überlass doch das Singen denen die es können !! NIGHTWISH = TARJA !!!"
2,"Eines Vorweg: Tarja ist weg, da kann man nichts ändern, deshalb versuche ich der neuen Sängerin eine Chance zu geben. Als die Single erschien lies es sich schon erahnen. Die Sängerin war sicher ein guter Ersatz, aber dieses Lied konnte sie leider auch nicht Retten. Als dann das Album rauskam, und ich es zum ersten mal durchgehört hatte war mein erster Gedanke: Die Lieder habens nicht auf die letzten Alben geschafft und wurden jetztauf ein Album gepackt. Die einzigen Lieder, die wenigstens ein kleines bischen überzeugen konnten, waren ""Amaranth"", ""Sahara"" und ""Eva"". Beim Rest kann ich einfach nur den Kopf schütteln. Die Texte langweilig, die Melodien höchstens Mittelmaß und nicht mit früheren Nightwish-Alben zu vergleichen.  Wer mit dem Argument kommt, es seien eben ruhige Lieder sollte sich mal an Lieder wie ""Walking in the Air"" oder ""Sleeping Sun"" erinnern. Aber davon ist dieser Qualität ist das Album weit entfernt. Wie vllt aufgefallen kritisiere ich die Sängerin nicht. Das liegt daran das sie wirklich eine gute Stimme hat, die aber bei solchen Liedern nicht viel retten kann. Fazit: Ich werde mir sicher auch das nächste Album kaufen, aber ich hoffe das ich nie mehr so enttäuscht werde. Kein einziges Lied kommt an ""Nemo"" auch nur heran. Positive ausnahmen hatte ich ja bereits genannt. Aber ob man sich für 2-3 Lieder ein ganzes Album kaufen sollte ist für mich mehr als Fraglich."
2,"In Flames war für mich mal was besonderes.. die alben ""the jester race"" ""Whoracle"" und ""Clayman"" waren Göttlich. was aber ab der R2R kam war nur noch gehobener durchschnitt. In Flames haben ihre identität verloren und liefern seit der STYE nur noch belangloses zeug ab. Come Clarity ist für mich nun das schlechteste album was sie je rausgebracht haben. abgesehen von Take this life(hammer song) ist nix dabei was mich umgehauen hat, das ist echt sehr, sehr traurig."
2,"Dieses Album war der verzweifelte Versuch FALCO's an den modernen Zeitgeist (1991) anzuknüpfen. Doch der Versuch misslingt. Aufgesetzt und zumeist bemüht modern klingen die Remixes. ""Data de Groove"" und ""the Sound of Musik"" kommen im bereits bekannten Remix der Jahre 1990 bzw. 1986 daher (The Sound of Musik ist grandios - das beste Stück des Albums). Coming home belässt man gottlob in der originalen Album Fassung (das wird schon seine Gründe gehabt haben). Erträglich bis gelungen sind zusätzlich zu ""the Sound of Musik"" und ""Coming home"" lediglich die Neubearbeitungen von ""Junge Roemer"" und ""Rock me Amadeus"". Die übrigen 7 Trax: Mülleimer auf -rein damit. Was ihn hier bloss geritten hat?  (Schreibt ein grosser FALCO Fan erster Stunde bis zum heutigen Tag)"
5,"Das es zu den bisherigen Rezensionen viele misstrauische Anmerkungen gab, weil ""Chinese Democracy"" noch nicht veröffentlicht ist, möchte ich vorweg sagen, dass ich das Album bei einer Pressevorführung gehört habe. Es handelte sich dabei nicht um Demo-Versionen, sondern um die fertig gemasterte Platte. Entgegen meiner Erwartungen klingt ""Chinese Democracy"" alles andere als ""altbacken"". Ich würde sogar behaupten, dass die Songs zu den allerbesten gehören, die Axl Rose jemals geschrieben hat. In Anbetracht der astronomischen Produktionskosten, die ""Chinese Democracy"" verschlungen haben soll, wäre es auch schade, wenn das anders wäre. Schon das erste Stück - der Titeltrack! - gehört mit seinen völlig überdrehten Gitarrensounds zu den Highlights. Überhaupt steuern die Gitarren auf dem gesamten Album die dominierende Klangfarbe bei. Mit bis zu fünf Giatrristen hat Axl Rose die Stücke besetzt, unter anderem sind Robin Finck von Nine Inch Nails, Brian ""Buckethead"" Carroll und natürlich Paul Tobias zu hören. Dabei sind einige kompromisslos harte Songs wie ""Scraped"", ""I.R.S."" und ""Riad N' Bedouins"" herausgekommen, die allesamt nahtlos an den Klassiker ""Appetite For Destruction"" aus dem Jahr 1987 anknüpfen. Doch auch das andere Wesensmerkmal dieser ikonischen Band kommt nicht zu kurz: die Balladen! Was ""Don't Cry"" oder ""November Rain"" für das Album ""Use Your Illusion I"" waren, sind für ""Chinese Democracy"" die ergreifenden Nummern ""Street Of Dreems"" und ""This Is Love"". Beide brillant komponiert und gewohnt meisterhaft vorgetragen - mit gaaanz lang gezogenen Vocals, so wie nur Axl Rose es kann.   Bei allem Lob: Man muss sich natürlich darüber im Klaren sein, dass Guns N' Roses keinesfalls den Anspruch hatten, sich selbst neu zu erfinden. Was man auf ""Chinese Democracy"" zu hören bekommt, sind G N'R wie man sie kennt - und liebt. Es gibt einfach keine Band mit einem ähnlichen ""Sound"" und schon gar nicht mit einer ähnlichen Attitüde. Das ist zeitloser Hardrock par excellance und ganz nebenbei die Bestätigung eines alten Sprichworts: Gut Ding will Weile haben."
5,"Zugegeben nachdem ich die letzte Scheibe nicht ganz so dolle fand bin ich vorsichtig an dieses Album herangegangen. Ich was ich zu hören bekam hat mich glatt von den Füssen gehauen.  Schon der erste Song namens ""Rooting for the bad guy"" tritt einem dermassen in den Allerwertesten das es eine wahre Freude ist. Mit der aktuellen Single ""sweetest song"" geht es weiter mit einem Wahnsinnsriff und ein Refrain der sofort ins Ohr geht und nicht mehr heraus will. Dieses zieht sich durch alle Songs... Warum die Briten in Deutschland nie richtig Fuss fassen konnten ist mir ein Rätsel. Wer auf Rock der härteren Gangart aber jedoch eine gehörige Portion Melodie mag der kommt an dieser Band nicht vorbei. Ich hatte sie im Jahr 1996 als Vorband von AC/DC das erste Mal gesehen und bin seither ein Fan dieser Truppe. Die Energie die sie an diesem Abend auf die Bühne zauberte hatte mich überzeugt mal in ihre Alben reinzuhören. Dieses Album ist wieder ein Gang zurück in ihre eigene Vergangenheit und gleichzeitig frischer als jemals zuvor zu klingen. Tut mir ein Gefallen und testet diese Band an...sie haben es verdient und ich kann nur sagen das dieses Album bei mir in Dauerrotation steht.  Absoluter Geheimtipp!"
5,"Nach drei Jahren des Wartens und Hoffens liegt nun endlich Ruslanas neues englischsprachiges Album Wild Energy vor. Aufgenommen in den berühmten Hit Factory Studios in Miami, besticht das Album durch eine außergewöhnliche Mischung verschiedener Musikstile mit sozialem und politischem Engagement. Mit Texten über Denkfreiheit und Energieunabhängigkeit für besseren Klimaschutz greift Ruslana aktuelle weltpolitische Themen auf.  Mit Wild Energy wagt sich die ukrainische Amazone weit über ihr so erfolgreiches Vorgängeralbum Wild Dances hinaus und legt noch einen Gang zu. Eine perfekte Produktion und gesangliche Erstklassigkeit machen das Album zu einem echten Ohrenschmaus.  Überraschend dabei die Duette mit zwei amerikanischen Superstars: Missy Elliot und T-Pain. Moon of Dreams, der Song mit T-Pain, war bereits in Polen und anderen osteuropäischen Ländern ein Hit.  Daneben finden sich Powersongs wie Wild Energy, Heaven Never Makes Us Fall, Dancing In The Sky und Silent Angel und die wunderschönen Ballade The Energy of Love auf der Scheibe. Besonderes Augenmerk möchte ich auf Overground, New Energy Generation und Heart On Fire richten, die besonders wild daherkommen.  Wild Energy ist ein tolles neues Album einer großartigen Sängerin und Komponistin, das einen Platz in jeder Musiksammlung verdient hat. Also kauf es!  Wenn du das ganze Wild Energy-Feeling haben möchtest, empfehle ich außerdem die geniale Amazonka-CD. Mit dieser ukrainischen Version erlebt man das Album in einer ganz neuen Dimension. Und außerdem gibt es dazu noch weitere Spitzen-Songs wie Vohon Chi Lid und die Hymne Not For Sale mit der Ruslana die aktuelle UN.GIFT-Kampagne gegen Menschenhandel unterstützt."
5,"Nach dem einfach brillianten ""Somewhere out in Space"" schlägt die Combo um Kai Hansen (meiner Meinung nach der begabteste deutsche Metaller) hier etwas düsterere Töne an. Das treibende Grundgerüst (schnelle Drums und rasante Rhythmen) bleibt erhalten, aber die fröhlichen Melodien der Vrgängers wurden durch teils sehr apokalyptisch anmutende ersetzt. Dieser Eindruck wird auch durch das Cover verstärkt. Musikalisch mindestens genauso überzeugend und abwechslungsreich wie ""Land of the Free"" oder ""Somewhere out in Space"" gefällt Mr. Hansen am Mikro jedes Mal besser. Als hätte er die Geschichten, die er erzählt, selbst erlebt. Die Weltuntergangshymne ""Armageddon"", der Opener ""Anywhere in the Galaxy"", aber auch die wunderschönen, von märchenhaftem Sound gezeichneten ""Send me a sign"" und ""Razorblade Sigh"" sind in meinen Augen die Sahnestücke des Albums... =&gt; Ich würde einen halben Stern abziehen, aber das wäre nur subjektiv."
1,"Diese Platte hat nichts mit dem canadischen Künstler K-Os zu tun, die Namensgebung K-O$ dieser Rap-Platte führt zur Verwechslung."
1,"Schon die Single ""Das Spiel"" deutete wieder einen faden Hype um eine Künstlerin an, die ohne die moderne Tontechnik kaum etwas aus ihrer Stimme herausholen könnte."
4,"Einmal mehr betätigen sich Chris, Carla &amp; Co. als innovative, entdeckungsfreudige Song-Arcghäologen. Diesmal gibt's Coverversionen europäischer Songs (in der ersten Hälfte südlich, in der zweiten nördlich) - einige bekannte Namen wie Jacques Brel, Mikis Theodorakis, Blumfeld (!) und Solex (!!!) sind dabei; das meiste fällt aber in die Obskuritäten-Kategorie. Der Ton ist generell leise, verregnet und melancholisch - Kammer-Folk-Pop im besten Sinne. Zu entdecken gibt es - wie fast immer bei den Walkabouts - vieles. Scott Walkers ""Man From Reno"" zum Beispiel, das schmissige ""That's How I Live"" von Blumfeld (übersetzt übrigens von Carla höchselbst""); das schwermürtige ""Disamistade"" oder den todtraurigen Fado ""Hard Winds Blowin'"". Wenn schon Coveralben als Stopgap in der Schreibpause, dann bitte so inspiriert wie dieses hier. Einmal mehr ein reiner Genuss."
2,"Meine Erwartungen wurden enttäuscht. Wer hier Verbindungen zu Pink Floyd oder zu anderen großen Stücken von David Gilmour erwartet, findet sich schnell in flachem Gewässer wieder. Keine Höhen und Tiefen, keine Spannung, sondern belanglose Fahrtstuhlmusik mit hohem Einschlaf-Faktor. Da kaufe ich mir ""Dark Side On The Moon"" lieber ein 4. Mal, als SACD. Dieses Geld ist bestimmt besser angelegt. Schön, wenn der Mann seinen Frieden mit sich selbst gemacht hat, aber muss man deshalb ein erwartungsfrohes Publikum langweilen? Wäre da nicht der große Name, hätte so ein Album bestimmt keinen Produzenten gefunden."
5,"Die berühmten Aufnahmen für Hall aus den frühen 60er Jahren. Eins der besten Gitarren-Blues-Alben aller Zeiten, ursprünglich unter dem Titel ""The Cool Sound of Albert Collins"" veröffentlicht."
1,"Zahllose sinnlose und auf dauer wirklich nervenzersetzende Sommerhits wurden uns in den letzten Jahren präsentiert. Fairerweise muß man gestehen, daß jeder Song, wenn er die 12 mal pro Tag Marke im Radio überschreitet, die Schmerzgrenze durchbricht. Da kann es sich um noch so gute Musik handeln. Doch die Kurve zeigt dennoch steil nach unten. Statt Melodie gibts meist nur noch Rythmus verbunden mit Texten, die Kinderreime wie literarische Meisterwerke erscheinen lassen. Aber dieses spezielle Lied übersteigt Lambada und Ketchup Songs aus längst vergangenen Tagen zur Potenz. Er nervt bereits beim ersten mal zuhören ganz gewaltig. Wie einfalls- und niveaulos wird unsere musikalische Zukunft noch werden. Ist noch Steigerung möglich??? Ich bin zuversichtlich !!!"
4,"Lang genug habe ich mich gegen die Ketchup-Mädels gewehrt, bis ich mal in einer Disco den ""Ketchup Song"" mitgetanzt habe. Super Stimmung ! Aus dem Grunde wollte ich mal hören, ob die Ketchup-Mädels auch noch weitere Lieder drauf haben. Die gute spanische Version des Ketchup Songs ist ja schon auf der CD-Maxi mit drauf. Tatsächlich wurde ich fündig: Lied Nr.3 ""Un de vez en cuando"" kommt einem zwar etwas bekannt vor, ist aber ebenfalls ein wunderschönes Lied. Die übrigen Lieder hätte man auch weglassen können, aber zwei schöne Lieder und eines davon in einer ebenfalls schönen Spanisch-Version - damit liegen die Ketchup Girls über dem Durchschnitt und haben mehr als nur einen Super-Hit !"
5,"Eine sehr gelungene Einspielung ! Die interessante und abwechslungsreiche Werkzusammenstellung hebt diese Aufnahme von vielen anderen positiv ab. Herausragend: Das Ensemble Amarcord im Terzett des ""Christus"" - Fragments und im Quintett des 42.Psalms. Insgesamt sehr empfehlenswert !!!"
5,"Eine sehr gute track auswahl, für ein greatest hits album. Man erinnert sich bei diesem Album gern zurück, und fragt sich wo sie denn geblieben ist?!? Die gute alte Metalzeit..."
5,"Über Entwine bin ich nur zufällig gestolpert, bin aber sehr froh darum. Lange habe ich nach einer weiteren Band gesucht, die wie FOR MY PAIN melodischen, düsteren und melancholischen Gothic dieser Art spielt. Mit Entwine habe ich eben diese zweite Band gefunden.  Gleich der erste Song „Losing the ground"" ist für mich einer der stärksten und besten Songs von Entwine. Zunächst spielt Keyboarderin Riitta Heikkonen ein sehr episch klingendes Thema, dann kommen Gitarrist Tom Mikkola und Bassist Joni Miettinen mit wirklich fett klingenden Gitarren hinzu. Über dieses Thema singt dann Sänger Mika Taurianen später den Refrain. Gegen Ende wird der Song immer heftiger und geht fast übergangslos in den zweiten Song „Snow white suicide"" über, einer auch sehr guten, nur nicht so düsteren Nummer. „Closer (my love)"" ist eine echt gelungene, sehr traurige Ballade mit wunderschöner Melodie und guten dezent eingesetzten Streichern zum Schluss. „New dawn"" ist Song Nummer Zwei recht ähnlich, flott und fetzend. Ein weiterer Höhepunkt und zugleich wieder ein wahres Meisterwerk ist „ Thru the darkness"", denn dieser Song hat einen Refrain, der einen schier umhaut. Auch zeigt Sänger Taurianen, dass er sowohl mit klarer, sehr emotionaler Stimme als auch mit tiefer rauer Stimme singen kann.  Entwine zeigt schon auf ihrem zweiten Album sehr viel Talent, Geschick und Potenzial für die Zukunft. Alle fünf Musiker beherrschen ihr Instrument und brillieren von Zeit zu Zeit. Jedoch kann ich es nicht verstehen, warum Entwine so stark mit HIM verglichen werden. HIM sind in meinen Augen absolute Nichtskönner, allen vorran Sänger Ville Vallo mit seinem ätzenden tuntigen Auftreten. Zum Schluss sei noch gesagt, dass jeder Fan von FOR MY PAIN sich Entwine-Alben ruhig kaufgen kann, da die beiden einen ähnlichen Stil haben. Und allen Entwine-Fans sei die FOR MY PAIN, empfohlen."
5,"Die Platte besticht vor allem durch die Tracks Hello, Worse Than Devil und Heo. Absolut empfehlenswert!!!!!!!! Mit der Platte haben die Kasseler was richtig Gutes geschaffen."
1,"3/4 dieser Maxi CD ist der Sound geclippt, das heisst übersteuert und klingt als brüllt jemand in eine Keksdose hinein. Was Universal hier abliefert schreit zum Himmel auf das die Dynamikkompression gerade bei stimmgewaltigen Talenten wie Joana Zimmer doch aufhören möge. Das Album werde ich wohl nicht kaufen, denn ich sehe keinen Grund warum Universal es nicht auch durch Overcompression bewusst kaputtmachen sollte."
2,"Wer Nena mag, wird sich auch dieses Album zulegen. Altbewährt und mit dem hörbarem Einatmen von Nena ist es wie die Alben vorher. Das Klischee, daß Nena von Ihren alten Hits lebt, ist mit diesem Album wiederlegt worden. Meiner Meinung nach nur eingefleischten Fans zu empfehlen, denn die Auskopplung (Liebe ist-das beste Lied) wird ja rauf und runter im Radio gespielt..."
2,"Nach dem Weltweiten Erfolg ""Justified"" wagt Justin Timberlake einen Nachfolger zu veröffentlichen. Die erste Single ""Sexy Back"" überrascht mit neuen Still und wie Robbie Williams, versucht sich Justin mit einem verzerrten Sprechgesang und einen monotonen Beat. Die Texte habe ich eigentlich nicht so richtig verstanden: ""I'm bringing Sexy Back - all the boys don't know how to act..."" - Entwickelt er sich eher wie Christina Aguilera oder Ex- Freundin Britney Spears? Hört sich danach an, als ob er eine Art Diva verkörpert, der auf Kaugummi steht (soll ja kein Geheimnis sein). Auf jeden Fall bringt Sexy Back das neue Album Future Sex / Lovesounds relativ gut auf den Punkt. Denn eigentlich hören sich die Titel des Albums relativ ähnlich an und enttäuschen viele Fans, darunter auch die, die es eigentlich gerne sein möchten. Schade auch dass es keine richtige Balladen gibt oder Songs wo Timberlakes Talente besser zur Geltung kommen würden. Musikalisch ist es auch schade, dass Justin sich nicht weiterentwickelt hat, aber dennoch ladet Future Sex / Lovesounds zum tanzen ein und genau deswegen kriegt die Platte von mir 2 Punkte (aus anderen Gründen wird die Platte wohl nicht gekauft). Immerhin landet Justin mit seiner aktuellen Nummer doch auf Platz 1 und ist musikalisch auch wenn nicht ganz bunt gemischt, dennoch besser als sein Konkurrent Robbie Williams."
1,"Einfallsloser kann ein Text nicht sein... langweiliger kann ein Videoclip nicht sein... aber dank riesiger Promotion, die die Plattenfirma sicher angezettelt hat, damit Monrose nicht ganz von der Bildfläche verschwinden, trällern die diesen ""Song"" jetzt an jeder Ecke und in jeder Werbung... Es ist kaum auszuhalten! Einfach nur schlimm!"
1,"In Ihrer Anfangszeit waren Scooter ja noch originell, aber wenn seit Jahren immer wieder die gleiche Single veröffentlicht wird, frage ich mich, wer diesen Kirmes-Proll-Techno noch kauft..."
5,"Ich möchte nur kurz sagen, dass dieses Album ihr absolut Bestes ist. Wie ein großes Experiment. Man muss die Lieder aber öfters hören, bis man merkt, wie genial es ist. Anfangs fand ich es eher langweilig. Mitlerweile finde ich ganz besonders die Songs klasse, die man bei erstmaligem Hören überspringt; z.B. ""Desecration Smile"" und ""If"".  Gute Musik wird ja immer seltener, aber hier gibt es sie noch."
1,"Ich finde diese CD noch sinnloser als es ohnehin schon die erste war! Die Texte sind sinnlos und die Melodien langweilig. Diese CD ist wirklich nur was für Fans.  Die Songs hören sich auch alle zeimlich gleich an. Das highlight auf der cd ist ""Rette mich"". Der beste Song wie ich finde von Tokio Hotel, weil der Song neu eingesungen wurde und nun Bill mit seiner nun doch tiefen stimme überrascht! Aber, wie gesagt: Nur für echte Tokio Hotel Fans!"
5,"Ich habe diese CD letztes Jahr in Griechenland am Flughafen gekauft und muß eindeutig sagen, daß es ein tolles Album ist. Besonders schön ist die Ballade, die gleich als zweites drauf ist.  Wundervoll schön und erotisch, das ist eine geheimnisvolle Stimme. Kann ich nur empfehlen.  Fast jedes Lied der CD kann man auch Ellinikos FM hören."
2,Als großer ??? - Fan habe ich mich auf die NEUEN Folgen sehr gefreut. Die erste Folge (Das Seeungeheuer) ist wirklich etwas langweilig. Aber waren die alten Folgen ( ab Folgew 45) nicht auch zum Teil sehr ermüdend??? Dafür ist die dritte Folge (Verschollen in der Zeit) sehr spannend und handwerklich gut gemacht.
2,"Leider! Habe dieses Albm (wie viele) lang erwartet und bin enttäuscht. Ja klar, Amy Lee ist fantastisch, wie immer, die Band hat auch gut gespielt, aber die Songs sind schwach, nicht einer, der an das Fallen-Album heranreicht (höchstens ""Call me when you're Sober"" hätte es vielleicht noch fast schaffen können). Und viel Schlimmer: Die Magie fehlt! Nicht eine Sekunde des Albums geht unter die Haut. Hört man sich ""Fallen"" an, bekommt man jedesmal Gänsehaut und bei ""The Open Door"" nie. Ben Moody fehlt einfach, ohne Zweifel."
2,die neuen platten haben mit den alten nichts mehr gemein - es fehlt die klasse komplexe  raffinesse der kompositionen  und die extatische dynamik in den stücken der erst univers zero ausmachten . geblieben sind kurze seqmente die minimalistisch  eher flächig vor sich hindudeln  die harmonik ist eher polyromantisch  im vergleich zu früher die eher inspiriert von stravinsky  bartok und eben univers zero war
5,"Tatsächlich kenne ich diese Platte jetzt seit mehr als 30 Jahren, konnte mittlerweile auch eine CD bekommen und höre sie schon immer sehr gerne: Da sind die typischen Krautrockelemente ebenso vertreten wie eine große Portion Jazzrock, dem vielleicht trotz Doldinger und Dauner damals besten in Deutschland. Da ist die den beginnenden 70ern anhaftende Affinität zu Drogen ebenso beinhaltet wie eine gehörige Portion Gesellschaftskritik, die auch heute noch stimmig ist - fast schon seherisch z.B. TV-Program. Viel Poesie, viel Seele gepaart mit Musikaliät und Rockfeeling. Man nannte das damals unkommerzielle Musik. Sie ist es bis heute geblieben - und unkonventionelle dazu. Ich denke, die Platte, die Musik, wird mich vollends durch mein Leben begleiten."
5,"Als ich das erste Mal ""All the things she said"" hörte, legte ich die CD wieder ins Regal zurück. Doch nur wenige Tage später hörte ich das Lied ""Malchik Gay"" und war sofort begeistert. Inzwischen gefällt mir dieses Album sehr gut, auch die ruhigen Nummern wie das feinfühlige ""Stars"" mit den witzigen russischen Rap's, das fast schon enya-artige ""Clowns: Can you hear me now"" und das romantische ""30 Minutes"" ebenso wie die lebhafteren ""Not gonna get us"" und die Single ""All the things she said"". - Ich habe übrigens mal eine russische Strassensängerfamilie live gehört - also die schreien tatsächlich so, wenn sie singen. Schade, dass Yulia und Lena dieses Lesbo-Image nötig haben, andererseits sehen wir ja, wie schwer sich Britney Spears und Christina Aguilera damit tun, ihr ""Süsses Mädchen""-Image loszuwerden. Man darf gespannt sein, wie der Weg von t.A.T.u. weiter verläuft !"
4,"Juchhei, die Landsmänner der unsäglichen Sepultura haben mit diesem Album wiede die Kurve gekriegt. Die Produktion der CD ist im Vergleich zur ""Ageless..."" bedeutend besser und druckvoller, vergleichbar mit ""Conquerors Of..."" . Eben genau der Sound den Krisiun brauchen. Daher ""tropfen"" Perlen wie ""Thorns Of Heaven"", ""Murderer"" und ""Wolfen Tyranny"" samtweich in jeden Gehörgang :-) Ein gehöriger Kritikpunkt ist jedoch die Spielzeit. Wenn man die (überflüssigen) Instrumental-Stücke, den Cover Song und die Wiederaufnahme des Klassikers ""They Call Me Death"" außen vor läßt, bleiben nichtmal 25 min neues Songmaterial. SEHR spärlich!! Mich persönlich stört dabei noch mehr, daß die Songs relativ kurz ausgefallen sind. Dadurch geht einiges an Dynamik verloren (ok, ok...viele Kritiker unterstellen Krisiun eh schon mangelnden Ideenreichtum und sind wahrscheinlich ob der kurzen Spielzeiten heilfroh) und deshalb bleiben die ersten drei Alben von Krisiun unerreicht !!! Trotzdem ein klasse Album einer Band, die aufgrund ihrer musikalischen Kompromisslosigkeit Maßstäbe gesetzt hat."
2,"Judith eine super Stimme und gehörte zu meinen Favouriten bei DSDS. Aber dieses Lied geht mir wirklich auf den geist, selbst als ich es beim 1. Mal gesehen habe, musste ich nach kurzer zeit wegschalten... Judith hat viel mehr drauf als das was sie bei diesem Lied zeigt. Bin echt enttäuscht... aber ich hoffe das ihre nächste Single bzw. ihr Album super wird, denn Stimme hat sie."
5,Diese CD ist wirklich wieder einmal gelungen. Wer den sympatischen Julien Clerc noch nicht kennt wird von seiner sanften unverwechselbaren Stimme begeistert sein. Seine neue CD ist sehr schwungvoll geworden und jedes Lied auf der CD gelungen. Gute Texte uns super Musik. Julien Clerc ist seinem Still treu geblieben und trotzdem ist die neue CD so frisch und anders geworden. Die richtige CD für den Sommer!
4,"Jazz, Industrial, Emo und Punk - so unterschiedlich die Hintergründe der Musiker sind, so erstaunlich ist es doch, wie gut das zu funktionieren scheint. Die ebenfalls wie GY!BE aus Kanada stammenden Do Make Say Think haben sich ebenso wie erstere auf dem Constellation Label eingenistet, das auch Heimat des GY!BE Nebenprojekts A Silver Mt. Zion ist."
5,"Klänge sie nicht so gut und wüsste man es nicht besser; man glaubte hier eine begnadete und unbekümmerte Rock'n Roll Band der späten 50er auf CD zu hören. Jonathan Richman ist ohnehin ein Ausnahme-Talent, aber dieses Album ist schier unglaublich. Es geht um Spass, Party und Tanzen... und so klingt die Musik: Befreit, beschwingt und eben sehr tanzbar. ""New kind of neighborhood"" oder ""I love hot nights"" sind verkannte Klassiker!  Das Album pulsiert und es gibt nur Magie; keine Lauheiten. KAUFEN!!"
5,"Und zwar im Dream Theater, denn man hört überdeutlich wer das große Vorbild ist und zwar an allen Ecken und Kanten. Jedoch ist das gar nicht schlimm, denn ich behaupte mal die Platte ist mindestens auf dem Niveau von ""Scenes from a Memory"" oder ""Images and Words"" und zwar technisch, musikalisch und von der Produktion sogar besser als die meisten DT Alben. Jedes Lied ist auf seine Weise genial. Selbst neun/zehn Minuten Überlängen Tracks gehen vorbei wie in Zeitraffer, so dermaßen genial ist das, was man hier geboten bekommt. Und das schöne ist, dass Vanden Plas Melodien und Härte kombinieren ohne, dass ein Teil zurückstecken muss. Alles ist harmonisch in einem Guss, ohne Schwächen. Wer ist eigentlich Dream Theater?"
1,"Zum Glück kann man vorher in CDs reinhören. Diese CD ist nicht mehr von der Band die noch mit zwei guten Vorgänger Alben überzeugen konnte. Jetzt ist es entgültig vorbei und Ville und der Rest der Band sind dem Absatzmarkt verfallen und anscheinend nur noch aufs Geld aus. Diese CD blubbert vor sich hin und am Ende denkt man, dass das ein langes Lied war. So monoton wirkt diese CD. Die Songs sind langweilig und klingen eher nach Pop. Unterm Strich bleiben also zwei gute Alben und seit dem existieren die eigentlichen HIM für mich nicht mehr!"
1,"Zu Edge of Sanity muss man nicht viel sagen: Sie sind/waren eine DER Größen in der frühen und auch fortgeschrittenen Schweden-Metal-Szene. Crimson ist ein Meilenstein. Nicht nur wegen der Idee, das Album als Ein-Lied-Album mit genau 40 Minuten Länge zu konzipieren, sondern vor Allem deshalb, weil Edge of Sanity beweisen, dass sie - im Gegensatz zum Großteil der heutigen Death-Metal-Flut - beweisen, dass sie den Hörer über die volle Distanz eines Albums zu fesseln wissen. Dass das Ganze dann noch als eine geschlossene Geschichte verpackt wird, rundet Crimson zu einem 100%igen Volltreffer ab. LEIDER kommt die Idee des Ein-Lied-Albums bei der MP3-Version von Amazon überhaupt nicht richtig rüber, weil das Album in 8 Tracks mit deutlichen Pausen angeboten wird! Sämtliche geschickt gemachten Übergänge sind hinüber! Und somit auch der epische Touch des Albums. Dann lieber eine gebrauchte CD kaufen."
2,"Vorweg eines: Ich war auf den letzten zwei Eagles-Konzerten in München. Die Band ist live noch besser als auf der CD. Ich bin absoluter Eagles-Fan. Aber: Die Doppel-CD ""Long Road Out Of Eden"" versprach mehr, als sie hält. Es ist nur ein Titel dabei, der rocked (""How long""), alle anderen sind mehr und dann noch mehr seicht. Klar bringen sich alles Band-Mitglieder ein und, klar haben sich alle entwickelt. Aber Sie entwickelten sich hier zu weit weg von ihren Wurzeln. Ich bin somit enttäuscht von der CD. Zugleich bin ich aber froh, dass die Eagles mal wieder ein Album auf den Markt bringen. CIAO"
5,"This Album contains pure power !!  Enjoy the ""disturbed"" powerfull base and energy.  It contains the unique sound created by The Prodigy  and blows you away ;)))"
5,"Letztes Jahr um diese Zeit bin ich auf diese CD gestoßen und seitdem hör ich sie zur Weihnachtszeit rauf und runter. Die CD ist sehr abwechslungreich, man findet schnellere und langsamere Lieder. Der Sänger interpretiert die Weihnachtslieder auf seine ganz eigene Art und das ganze wird durch eine Big Band begleitet. Nur zu empfehlen!"
5,"Die früheste Live-Aufnahme des legendären zweiten Miles-Davis-Quintetts vom September 1964; wenige Monate also, nachdem Wayne Shorter Mitglied der Band wurde. Soviel ich weiß, ist dies neben den Aufnahmen aus dem ""Plugged Nickel"" in Chicago der einzige offizielle Live-Mitschnitt von Davis/Shorter/Hancock/Carter/Williams."
5,"Ich hab halte seit ca. 3 h die Limitied Edition der Peppers in der Hand und kann nur sogen, TOP TOP TOP!! Nicht nur dass das Album erste Sahne ist, nein auch die ganze Aufmachung der Box, Wenn man auf die Box schaut, sieht man wie in verschiedenen Lagen das eig. ""Cover"" sorgfältig auseinander genommen wurde und dann als Collage zu sehen ist. Es macht sich super in meinem Schrank. Auch die anderen Accesoures die dabei sind, 4 von den Peppers verfasste Bilder, wo sie auch noch was hingeschrieben haben, der Kreisel mit 4 verschiedenen Flächen, die Murmel Packung , wobei ich mich immer noch Frag wozu die eig. nützlich is *g* und noch ein kleiner Papierblätter Spender wo aussen der Refrain von Slow cheetah draufsteht ... das schönste ist jedoch noch das aufwenidg gestaltete Songbook, wo von beiden CD's die Lyrics stehen und Bildern von den Pepprs zu sehen sind. Jetzt aber zu Musik ;) Das Album, was ich bis jetzt erst einmal gehört habe :(, hat meine Erwartungen keineswegs Enttäuscht, allein die Singel hat mich die ganze Woche im Bann gehalten. Die Musik,die die 4 dieses Jahr produziert haben ist echt der Wahnsinn, es geht von funkigen Liedern z.B.""Warlock"", bis zu etwas härteren Liedern z.B. ""So much I"" .Der Refrain von ""Desecration Smile"" z.B. errinert ein bisschen ""Dosed"" ( By the way)...,das Lied  ""She Looks to me"" ist ein eher ruhigeres Lied, was ganz nett gemacht ist. Es gibt soagr ein Lied , wo Flea mit der Trompete spielt ;)(Torture me) Die Peppers, haben ihren typischen Sound beibehalten , Flea spielt auf seinem Bass wie noch nie, es passt einfach alles. Ich könnte noch so viel Über diese CD's und die Musik schreiben, aber hört es euch selbst an!! ES lohntsich wirklich!!! ... die Peppers sind back, und nicht zu kurz! Die Stadium Arcadium (Limited Edition mit Bonus-DVD) ist für Fans, die bei der normalen Version zu kurz kommen echt ein Muss! Danke :)"
5,"Endlich schlägt Robbie einen musikalischen Weg ein, der für mich einfach nur genial ist! Schon bei ""No regrets"" liebte ich die Zusammenarbeit mit Neil Tennant von den Pet Shop Boys. Und endlich wieder eine Zusammenarbeit. Ich liebe den elektronischen Sound des Albums. Es ist das erste Album nach dem ""I've Been Expecting You""-Album, welches ich mir von Robbie Williams gekauft habe - weil er endlich einen richtigen guten Weg eingeschlagen hat. Die große Enttäuschung bei einer Vielzahl seiner Fans bestätigt meine Freunde über einen tatsächlichen Sound-Wechsel! Nach vielen Jahren hat mich Robbie endlich mal wieder positiv überrascht!"
1,"Wer sich im letzten Jahr die Hilary Duff CD ""Metamorphosis"" zugelegt hat, wird bei der neuen Scheibe von Avril Lavigne aus dem Staunen nicht herauskommen. Viele Titel klingen wie die Hilary Duff Titel ""The Math"", ""Party up"" oder ""The girl can rock"". Es gibt aber einen wesentlichen Unterschied. Avril hat ihre Stimme nicht im Griff. Sie gleitet häufig aus der Melodie. Wenn man bösartig ist, kann man Avrils Gesang sogar in die Nähe von Schreien bringen. Aber darüber könnte man ja noch hinwegsehen. Was aber nach mehrmaligem Hören extrem nervt, ist die Eintönigkeit und Langweiligkeit der Platte. Die Platte ist in keinster Weise empfehlenswert.Wer abwechlungsreichere Rockmusik hören will, ist auf jeden Fall bei der neuen CD von Hilary Duff besser aufgehoben."
2,Leider nicht gelungen. Sie findet ihre Form nicht. Titel Zusammenstellung scheint willkührlich und man spürt die verwirrtheit der interpretin. NAchdem Avril nun endlich auch in dem Prozess der Song entwiklung mitwirken darf geht der rote Fahden verlohren. Dieses Album zeigt das sie doch nicht so erwachsen und rockig ist wie sie gern wäre. Versuchs noch mal BAby.
1,"so ""neu"" das image ist, dass uns präsentiert wird (""echt"", wild, rockig), so wenig anders von bereits gehörtem ist ihre musik. das meiste davon, auch die balladen, sind zwar noch gefällig, aber nicht gitarrenlastig und verlassen auch nicht den bereich des gewohnten."
5,"Das Besondere an dieser Manilow Hit Collection sind die drei Songs, die sehr flott remixed wurden: COULD IT BE MAGIC, COPACABANA und I'M YOUR MAN."
4,"Auf dem neuen Album der Corrs sind mehr Stilrichtungen vertreten als auf den anderen beiden zuvor. Die neue Platte behält viel gutes von den vorherigen Alben bei: die wunderschönen Melodien, Lyrics und Stimmen.  Jedoch hat In Blue keine Ecken und Kanten, es ist ""nur"" eine  Poplatte. Das Spezielle, das FnF und ToC ausgezeichnet hat, ging hier  leider im Rennen auf die vordersten Chartspositionen meist verloren. Auch  hätten die Corrs sich die Studioaufnahme von ""At your side""  sparen können, die Version ist nur ein blasser Remix der Unplugged-Version."
4,"1990 - meine erste Konfrontation mit diesem abgedrehten Zeug. Bis heute finde ich es immer noch abgedreht, aber absolut genial. Mit diesem Album haben ASF ein fast komplettes Meisterwerk abgeliefert. Nur bei den Bonustracks kann ich mir nicht helfen. Was haben die Leute um Nick da blos eingeworfen? Bis auf einen kommen alle hinten dran und man kann getrost nach I think I auf die Stoptaste drücken. Mit Curse, besonders gleich der erste Song Katch22, haben ASF eins von drei wirklich genialen Alben in die Dunkelwelt gebracht. Hier wird alles geboten, was ihren Sound so einzigartig macht. Seltsamerweise gab es mit diesem Sound keinen einzigen Nachahmer. Ich denke mal, daß keiner den richtigen Cocktail zusammenstellen konnte, um dieses Ausmaß an seltsamer Kreativität zu entwickeln. Haben ASF anfangs doch sehr gitarrenlastig gearbeitet, wird auf Curse ein großer Einsatz von Elektronik zelebriert. Das war vorher auch schon mit drin, aber nicht so massiv wie hier. Auch nach 18 Jahren hat dieser Sound für mich seinen genialen Klang bewahrt. Sicher würde jetzt einiges anders gemacht werden, man höre sich nur seine letzten Outputs an, aber Curse finde ich neben ACID BATH und OPEN HEAD SURGERY absolut cool (immer noch!). Eigentlich hätte ich 5 Sterne geben müssen. Für die überflüssigen Bonustracks gibts dann aber doch einen Stern Abzug."
1,"Die Gitarrenarbeit auf dem Album ist zwar technisch ganz gut(hab schon spektakuläreres gehört) aber trotzdem total nervend. Ich bewerte das Album nicht so schlecht weil ich nicht auf diese Art der Musik stehe, denn ich bin z.B. ein riesen Satriani-, Vai-, Malmsteen-, Petrucci- und Morse-Fan, aber ich erkenne in den Songs keine Musik. Überhaupt kein Spielwitz, das ist nur Geprotze! Die Melodien sind entweder zu kitschig, oder gänzlich unpassend(gescheiteter Versuch innovativ zu sein).Am aller schlimsten ist das Live-Solo.&lt;&lt; Was soll das sein?&gt;&gt; Auch der Gitarrensoung ist scheußlich. Nur unkoordinierte Overdubs bei fast allen Melodien, damit bei schnellen Solos manchmal wirklich nur noch Krach zu hören ist.   Ich rate euch falls ihr anspruchsvolle Gitarrenmusik erleben wollt, probiert es vielleicht mal mit den Gitarreros die ich genannt habe."
1,"...und biten auf dreisteste Art und Weise Timbaland und lassen drei ganz und gar schreckliche Erscheinungen der anspruchslosen Pop-Welt dazu emotionslos johlen.  Ich hoffe sehr, dass Monrose bald im Nichts verschwinden und die Major-Labels endlich merken, das der Break Even Point der Casting-Bands längst erreicht wurde..."
4,"Nun denn, ich will dieses Hörspiel nicht gleich zerreißen, nur weil ich während der gesamten Spieldauer auf das Wiedererwachen von T-Rex alias Georg Brand gewartet und mich auch gewundert habe, wie lange die Charade von Nolo, Kim Schmidtke und allen anderen wohl noch andauern kann, bis das Spiel endlich auffliegt. Ist eben meine Offenbarung 23 geschulte Denkweise....muß wohl akzeptieren, dass alles mal ein Ende hat. Daher werde ich mich innerlich mit dem Ende der alten Hörspielserie abfinden und der neuen noch eine Chance einräumen, bis ich die Folgen 31-33, die schon in meinem Regal liegen, fertig gehört habe. Wer weiss, vielleicht kann man sich dran gewöhnen....in der Zwischenzeit, tschüß T-Rex...."
2,"Grundgütiger, bei Lisa Bund wäre doch nun wirklich Zeit gewesen, in Ruhe ein Album heranreifen zu lassen, dass ihrer Stimme und Ausstrahlung angemessen ist. Stattdessen bekommt sie ein Album von der Stange, bei dem jeder Ton pure Berechnung ist. Offenbar lag die Schublade ""Kelly Clarkson"" am nächsten zum vorbereiteten Image, also bekommt sie soften amerikanischen Radiorock mit glatten Gitarren und Refrains aus der Klonfabrik. Es bleibt ein pelziger Geschmack von angestaubtem Achtziger-Rock a la Bonnie Tailer, Heart oder Cher, zumeist bräsig aufgemotzt und mit schlaffen Drums umterlegt. Das ganze zieht dermaßen lustlos an einem vorbei, dass man in Gedanken schon die Alben von Pink oder Avril Lavigne in der Hand hat (denn beide werden ausgiebig nachgeäfft.) Wie schon bei Monrose bleibt zwischen all dem Produktionsbling kaum Platz für die Stimme, die hier langweilige Melodien für Millionen zu Gehör bringt. Also ist der erste Stern für Ihre Stimme, der zweite dafür, ""Flugzeuge im Bauch"" mit auf das Album zu nehmen. Bleibt zu hoffen, dass sie mit dem Album soviel Geld verdient, dass sie beim nächsten Mal die rauhe, ehrliche und verletzliche Platte macht, die uns ihre Stimme längst versprochen hat. Bis dahin schüttelt man den Kopf, wie die Musikindustrie ihre mühsam ausgesiebten Talente mit nichtssagender Dutzendware verheizt."
4,"Ich war dieses Wochenende in Leipzig und habe mir Bharati angeschaut.Es war einfach traumhaft schön.Und das es eine CD davon gibt ist einfach klasse.So kann man sich die Lieder immer wieder anhören,z.B. das lustige ""Nimbooda"" oder ""Dil To Pagal Hai"", und die meisten Bollywoodfans kennen ""Bole Chudiyan aus K3G.Bei dem Lied ""Vande Mataram"" hab ich richtig Gänsehaut bekommen,davon gibts ja verschiedene Versionen und diese hier finde ich am besten.Wer sich die Show angesehen hat wird mir zustimmen das die CD eine gute Ergänzung ist.Und wer das Pech hatte diese Mal keine Karten bekommen zu haben oder nicht hinfahren konnte dem sei die CD wärmstens ans Herz gelegt,denn die Musik ist einfach wunderschön!!"
5,"Nachdem die Venylfassung nicht mehr spielbar war, habe ich lange gezögert die CD Version von ""Bat out of hell"" zu kaufen. Nun da  diese Special Edition veröffentlicht wurde, musste ich einfach zuschlagen und ich konnte feststellen, dass die Musik und die Interpretation der Jim Steinman Stücke durch Meat Loaf nichts an der früheren Faszination verloren hat."
1,"Oh nein, oh nein, und so etwas stürmt die britischen Charts. Da trällern und piepsen sich zwei kleine Mädchen mit dick aufgetragenem Lolita-Lesbo-Image in bester Manier der Mutter aller bauchfreien Berufs-Doofies durch Stücke, die weder musikalisch noch kompositorisch irgendwas Besonderes darstellen und das Video wirkt, als hätte der kleine Bruder aus Versehen die alte Super-8 von Daddy geschnappt. Engländerinnen, Schwedinnen, Deutsche, Ami-Girls? Wie heißen die noch? Ist ja egal - GÄHN! Ach nein, das ist ja was ganz Exotisches: das sind Russinnen! Hatten wir noch nicht! Mal was Neues, müssen wir kaufen! Oops - they do it again, schade um's Geld. Da bleibt's doch lieber bei True Metal und Hard 'n' Heavy oh, sorry, Männerdomäne, denn dabei muß man ja Stimme haben wie Patti Smith oder Tarja Tarunen, oder - Alptraum aller Kiddie-Groups, ob Boys oder Girls - gar ein Instrument beherrschen (Instrumente? Was is'n das?), da reicht's nicht, sich lediglich unvollständig angezogen zu zeigen. Dachte immer, in Rußland geht's nicht ohne Stimmausbildung auf die Bühne - anscheinend aber doch. Welcome to the Spears-Club! Jetzt haben auch die Russen ihre Britneys. Das Sternchen ist für die augeklügelte Marketingstrategie - und ich freue mich auf die nächste Deep Purple- und Whitesnake-Tour - das ist wenigstens noch real good rock music!"
5,"Eine wunderschöne CD, die Kinder als Zielgruppe ernst nimmt und damit auch deren Eltern fasziniert. Liebevoll gestaltet, informativ und mit großartigen Interpreten aus den Schätzen der Deutsche Grammophon. Dvorak wäre begeistert! (In meinen Augen sicher eine der gelungensten CDs aus der wunderschönen Reihe, von der - in Cassettenform - meine Kinder ebenso begeistert waren wie es jetzt die Enkel sind.)"
2,"Zugegeben, die rockigeren Lieder auf dem neuen Album passen besser zu Gracias Stimme. Trotzdem klingt das alles sehr nach Vanilla Ninja. ""When the last tears..."" hat vedächtige Ähnlichkeiten mit ""When die indians cry"" aus dem letzten Vanilla Ninja Album. Hier hat es sich Gracia Produzent Brandes, der ja bis vor kurzem auch Vanilla Ninja betreute sehr einfach gemacht. Frei nach dem Motto was sich einmal verkaufte, klappt bestimmt mindestens noch ein zweites Mal. Diese Album ist leider nur Durchschnitt und reicht bei weitem nicht an das Debütalbum heran. Schade eigentlich für eine tolle Sängerin wie Gracia, die sicherlich sehr viel mehr kann ."
5,"... war es im Heilbronner Bürgerhaus beim Konzert im Juli 2005, und ich durfte dabei sein. Blue Rose hat einen Super Job gemacht. Höre die Scheibe gerade zuhause und bin wieder live mittendrin  a u f   der Bühne. Direkter und  unverfälschter kann man eine Liveaufnahme nicht rüberbringen. Der  Lautstärkeregler wandert jetzt schon seit einer Stunde stückchenweise im Uhreigersinn, und sitzend hören ist nicht mehr drin. Wer nach Bottle Rockets sucht, dürfte sowieso schon Aufnahmen besitzen. Diese Doppel CD sollte ohne Frage dazugehören."
4,"Seit ein paar wenigen Tagen hat eine neue Langspielplatte ihren neuen Mittelpunkt auf meinem Kompaktdiskabspielgerät: Zion Trains lange fälliges und mit vielen Lorbeeren auszustattendes neues Album ""Original Sounds Of The Zion Remixed"". Also ganz original aber remixed. Ein Widerspruch in sich, der aber absolut keiner ist. Original natürlich lief der Sound bereits unter dem Titel ""Original Sounds of the Zion"" als pures Zion Train Album. Der neue Anstrich, eben der Remix des selben, macht aus dem Original ein originell. Namhafte Künstler wie Ryan Moore (Twilight Circus), Vibronics, Transglobal Underground und andere bekannte Namen aus allen Ecken (von Finnland bis Neapel) haben sich auf exellente Art am ZT Sound vergriffen und ihn veredelt. Ein flüssiges Klangbild darf man sich hier vorstellen, die tolle Stimme der Zion Train Sängerin Molara inklusive, der typische Sound vom Tüftler Perch und das ganze trotz Studio Aufnahmen und Remix irgendwie wie live. Toll wie treibend der Sound aus den Boxen dröhnt."
2,"First of all: Ich LIEBE Tupac und sein Musik. Und genau das ist auch der Grund, aus dem ich dieses Album so verabscheue. Genau wie die x Vorgänger, die dem genialen Makaveli-Album nachgeworfen wurde, ist dieses Werk wieder eine noch schlechtere Darbietung von Mr.Shakurs Können."
2,"Ich hab mir diese CD gekauft, weil ich dachte: ""Wenn sie nur ansatzweise so klingt wie Deluxe Soundsystem, muss sie gut sein!"" Leider wurde ich enttäuscht. Das Album ist über weite Strecken träge und langweilig produziert. Nichts zu hören, von der Dynamik, von der Tracks wie ""Zornig"", ""Boom"" oder auch das kürzlich erschienene ""!?!"" getragen wurden. Außerdem hatte ich mehrere Deja Vus, denn einige Reime hatte ich schon früher auf anderen Beats als Freestyle verpackt gehört. So z. B. auch die ersten paar Verse auf ""Hausfriedensbruch"". Positive Ausnahme sind nur ""So solls sein"" auf dem Samy sich Unterstützung von Afrob holt. Allerdings klingt Samy dort genauso wie auf ""!?!"" und das Instrumental überzeugt mich auch nicht gerade. Aber auf auf einem schwachen Album reicht Mittelmäßigkeit m positiv aufzufallen. Fazit: Kauft euch lieber Eissfeldts Meisterwerk und wartet auf bessere Zeiten von Samy, denn er kanns definitiv besser. Vielleicht sollte er sich seine Tracks wieder von Tropf und Dynamite oder mal von Eissfeldt produzieren lassen."
5,Die CD ist einfach super. Das Cover und die CD sind schön gestalltet. Die Lieder sind super toll. Für alle Mika fans nur zu empfehlen^^
5,Also einfach super!!! Ich bin eigentlich kein großer Jeanette-Fan aber dieser Song der topt einfach alles und müßte noch weiter hoch in den Charts Super...!!!

1,"Den Hype, der um ""The Strokes"" momentan herrscht, und sie als ""Retter"" der Rock-Musik darstellt, kann ich absolut nicht nachvollziehen. Schon die bekannteren Titel wie ""Last Nite"" oder ""Is this it"" bieten nicht viel ausser Langeweile. Keine Hoehen und Tiefen, die Songs plaetschern einfach so vor sich hin. Mag sein, dass das manchen gefaellt. Mir allerdings nicht."
1,"... und weinen! Der U2-Pfad scheint auszubleichen. Die miesen Einschläge kamen immer näher. Die Zeit der kraftvollen Alben ist vorbei. Tapfer sein!, heißt es jetzt. Und ganz fest die alten Scheiben umklammern, als U2 noch gute Musik gemacht haben. Vielleicht kann man nicht jedes Mal einen solchen Kracher wie ACHTUNG BABY raushauen, aber deswegen sollte man auch keine Musik um der Musik willen machen, sondern dann, wenn das Herz auch dabei brennt! Einen Fan der ersten Tage habt ihr hiermit erstmal verloren."
5,"Das warten hat sich gelohnt. Beautiful, loved and blessed!!! ""3121"" könnte auch diesen Titel tragen, da es wahrlich gesegnet ist. Mit Támar hat Prince natürlich eine wahre Göttin mit ins Boot genommen. Super Stimme!"
1,"...aber THE RIVALRY zündet einfach nicht wirklich. Auf diesem Album gibt es nur zwei wirklich richtig gute Songs (Ballad of William Kidd + War &amp; Peace), die restlichen Songs sind allerdings eher standardmässige Rocksongs und dümpeln teilweise (zu lang) vor sich her."
5,"Das erste Major-Album der Band ist ein Highlight der Metal Geschichte. Rick Rubin verpasst dem Quintett einen Sound, der so Stoner-Cool war, dass Kyuss und Black Sabbath Fans gleichermaßen wegschmelzen müssten. R.I.P und At the End of my Daze sind meine Anspieltipps. Saucooler Platz 9!"
1,"Zu Weihnachten bekam ich die CD geschenkt und freute mich auch darüber. Doch als ich sie mir anhörte war die Ernüchterung schnell da. Nach dem Modern-Talking Motto ""Haste einen haste Alle"" lanweilt sich Dido von einer Schlafnummer zur anderen. Die beiden Auskopplungen sind noch die gelungensten Werke. Den Rest kann man sich echt schenken. Schade! Die CD gibts denn auch bald von mir bei Ebay ab einen Euro! Versprochen!"
4,"Als ich die Scheibe gehört habe, war ich natürlich auch sehr vom Opener beeindruckt und habe gespannt den restlichen Songs gelauscht. Mein Vorredner (schreiber) führte nur 4 Songs auf, die bes. herausragen und bezeichnete das Folgewerk der Mandrake-Mannen als ""Schritt zurück"" und weniger ""hart"". Diesem kann ich nur bedingt zustimmen.  Es gibt sehr wohl Songs die nicht überproduziert klingen, generell würde ich das nur bei einem Song befürworten (""It never Ends""). Denn bspw. ""Falling"" Away oder ""Crowned with Leaves"" sind geniale Song, die durchaus auch mit dem Opener in punkto Eingängigkeit mithalten können, auch die andern Songs tanzen da keineswegs aus der Reihe."
2,Coldplays neue Platte hat mich nicht richtig vom Hocker gehauen. Das Titelstück kam mir direkt sehr bekannt vor. Da ich Satriani Fan bin hatte ich ohne es direkt zu wissen die Melodie von Ihm im Ohr und vor kurzem erfuhr ich dann das er schon eine Klage gegen Coldplay eingereicht hat. Von mir 2 *
2,"Nachdem die Onkelz mit ""Hier sind die Onkelz"" das letzte gute Album rausgebracht haben, konnten die letzten beiden Alben ""Viva los tioz"" und ""Ein böses Märchen..."" nicht wirklich überzeugen.  Auf der neuesten Platte greifen die Onkelz zu altbekannten Riffs. Die Texte  sind zwar wie immer excellent und Kevin's rauhe Stimme reißt einiges raus.  Wer sich noch nicht mit den Onkelz beschäftigt hat, der sollte lieber zu  älteren Platten wie die schwarze&amp;weiße greifen und sich dann ein Bild  machen. Für die nächste Platte wünsche ich den Jungs aus Frankfurt bessere  Einfälle gewürzt mit alter Genialität! STAY TUNED!!!"
5,"Die letzte Rezension ist zu lange her.Dieses Album ist unerreicht.Leider hatte wir nie die Möglichkeit Johnny Cash -Live- mit seinen American-Recordings zu erlebenDies war ein Wunsch, welcher keine Erfüllung fand!RIP!"
2,"Die Bild-Leser wählten ihre 30 grössten Hits von Michael Jackson und so kann man eine Jubiläum - CD auch vermarkten. Die meisten Teile von Michael Jackson werden dieses Jahr 50 Jahre alt. Da hat die Plattenfirma Sony einfach eine weitere Best Of aus dem Ärmel geschüttelt und damit ist Michael Jackson wahrscheinlich bals neben Elvis der einzige Künstler, von dem mehr solche Alben als Originalalben existieren. Number Ones, Essential Michael Jackson, HIStory, Greatest Hits.... Die Musik ist meist über jeden Zweifel erhaben und er war in den 80ern wirklich der ""King Of Pop"". Doch heute lockt man mit einer solchen Zusammenstellung höchstens noch ahnungslose Spätgeborene. Denn dies ist ein Album ohne jeglichen Mehrwert für den Fan von MJ. Veröffentlicht von der der gleichen Firma (s.o.), die bislang geschätzte 20 Best Of - Zusammenstellungen von Elvis veröffentlichte. Da ist bei Michael Jackson ja erst der Anfang gemacht."
5,"LifeLike ist nun also Jeff Mills' erstes Cd-Release im neuen Jahrtausend, und wieder einmal zeigt sich, warum ihm immer noch von einschlägigen Kreisen höchste Verehrung zuteil wird. Als End-Dreissiger gehört er in der  Techno Community ja sozusagen schon zum alten Eisen, gleichzeitig darf er  aber als Mitbegründer von Underground Resistance (siehe DJ Rolando alias  The Jaguar) zu den Techno-Pionieren überhaupt gezählt werden. Nun also 14  Tracks aus dem grossen Schatz seiner drei Labels (Axis, Purpose Maker,  Tomorrow), teilweise unveröffentlicht oder bis dato nur auf dem 98er  Japan-only release ""From the 21st"" erhältlich. Es handelt sich um  sorgfältig inszenierte ruhige bis absolut energetische Tracks, all das  unter seiner persönlichen Definition von Techno, die alle engstirnigen  Techno-Fundis und gleichermassen die Techno-Skeptiker erstmal verstummen  lassen dürfte. Als eher schwammiger Begriff fällt mir da im Moment auch nur  der im Zusammenhang mit Jeff Mills vielbeschworene Futurismus ein. Tracks,  die teilweise mindestens fünf Jahre alt sind und damals (als streng  limitierte Promo) wie heute absolut frisch und kraftvoll klingen. Als  Momentaufnahme von Techno nach etwa 10 Jahren bewegter Geschichte ebenso  interessant wie auch als Indiz einer im mehrfachen Sinne sehr präsenten  Musik - wärmstens zu empfehlen!"
2,"Also Alexander hat's drauf-das wissen wir alle, aber auf der CD hörts sich das eine Lied wie das andere an, total langweilig, für den, der nicht ""nur"" Balladen hören möchte! Ausser natürlich Maniac- wär aber schön, wenns von Bohlen kommen würde..."
1,"Nena? Habe ich früher mal gern gehört. 99 Luftballons, ein Hit. Mit der Zeit aber ist sie in die Bedeutungslosigkeit abgeglitten, zumindest im muskalischen Bereich. ""Ich kann nix dafür"", ich denke, schon. Was die Wahl der Partner angeht, so kann man sich streiten, das ist Geschmackssache. Das Lied selbst aber: Die Melodie ist ein Ohrwurm, leider der unangenehmen Sorte. Der Text: sehr widersprüchlich! ""Butter in der Dose""? Was soll das heißen? Es wird in diesem Lied über nichts geredet, nur angedeutet und dabei auch nur wieder die übliche vergangene Liebe. Künstlerische Freiheit, ja gerne, aber man kann es auch übertreiben. ""Das ist wirklich dumm gelaufen""...da stimme ich zu! Und sie kann etwas dafür!"
2,"Ich habe mir gerne auf Partys oder in der Disco Nena - Klassiker angehört. Leider hat sie nun die Lieder wieder neu aufgemischt.  Man hatte immer die schönen Melodien von ""Nur geträumt"" u. a. im Kopf und jetzt kommt sie mit solch grässlich veränderten Versionen zurück. Man könnte meinen, daß Nena dringend Geld benötigt.  Mein Tip: Kauft Euch lieber die alten Hits, anstatt der Neuauflage. Ich war sehr enttäuscht."
5,"Dolly recorded for Columbia during the late eighties and early nineties, during which time she had three number one country hits during that period, the last of them (Rocking years) coming from this album. Rocking years was originally intended to be a duet with George Jones but he left the label so Ricky van Shelton became the duet partner. The success of the single may have owed more to Ricky (who was fashionable at the time) than Dolly, as American country radio only showed limited interest in the other singles from this album. Despite a lack of airplay, the album sold in vast quantities (well over a million in the USA) and deservedly so."
1,"ja er lebt...und zwar in diesem gar zünftig daherkommenden Volksmusi-Stück... und als Bonus sogar noch komponiert und präsentiert von echten Sachsen. Hut ab!! Soviel Popularität gab's für die ansonsten doch arg belächelten Vokalartisten gabs selten. Und das Lied schickt sich an, sich einzureihen in Hits wie Anton, oder Ab in den Süden. Das bürgt für Qualität...räusper... und so mancher Bierzeltbesucher sollte dann auch heftig mitgrölen und lediglich darauf achten, dass seine Dritten nicht das Weite suchen, denn vor allem die Kuckident-Fraktion sollte dabei ganz groß aufschreien, wenn's im Akkord lautet: JA ER LEBT... ich für meinen Teil verweigere mich jedoch diesem dumpfen Machwerk..."
1,"Nachdem ich einige wirklich tolle Oliver Shanti CDs gekauft hatte, erwarb ich hoffnungsfroh auch diese Scheibe. Welcher Abstieg! Fast jedes zweite Stück ist, was ich mal platt einfach so nenne, Indianer - Rap. Die ein oder zwei guten Stücke mit echtem Gesang gleichen das nicht aus. Wer Indianersongs von Shanti will, ist bei Medicine Power besser aufgehoben."
1,"Ich habe mich noch nie über eine CD bzw. Album geärgert, aber was Fräulein Bund da von sich gibt ist grauenvoll. Totales Schulsingen mit extremer Schreistimme. Alles klingt, als wäre sie unter Zeitdruck, ohne Gefühl und Wiedererkennung.  Dieses Album &amp; CD ist keinen Euro wert, dann lieber Spenden... Spätestens Dezember wird man eine Fräulein Bund nicht mehr kennen."
1,"Ich bin Onkelzfan seit ca. 16 Jahren. Ich habe diese CD auch gekauft, aus Sammelgründen (habe somit alle Alben der Onkelz), aber mit den letzten 3 Alben fange ich nichts an. Das hat mit Geschmack denk ich wenig zu tun, da mein Musikgeschmack sehr breit gefächert ist, sondern mehr mit der Qualität der Songs. Einfallslos, aneinandergereihte Melodiestücke, die nicht zusammen passen, kraftloser und gefühloser Gesang (welches ein Markenzeichen der BOs war!), spürbare langeweile. Einziger Ausreiser ist die Singleauskopplung, welche es auch tut. Zu Empfehlen nur an Sammler, ansonsten unbedingt reinhören! Sorry Onkelz, alles Gute!"
2,"Da freut man sich auf eine CD und dann ist man froh, dass man noch eine andere gekauft hat, die die Enttäuschung etwas auffängt! Alles in allem eine sehr gleichklingende CD, die nicht das hält, was man sich nach der Sendung und nach der Maxi versprochen hat. Die ""Am Fenster"" Platitüde (Musik zum Wegrennen!) hätte er sich klemmen können und auch ""Nothing else matters"" ist leider nicht mit so viel ""Herzblut"" gesungen, wie im Fernsehen. Der Rest ist seichter Unterhaltungspop, den man sich nicht so oft antun muss! Halt, ein Glanzlicht gibt es, die Interpretation von ""All for love"" mit Thomas und Michael! Die beiden singen komischerweise mit Herzblut!!! Schade, dass da nicht ein bisschen zu Martin übergeschwappt ist!"
1,"Bei DSDS fand ich Mike ja ganz okay. Aber sein Album ist grottenschlecht... Er singt die Songs so als wenn er sie nur endlich auf Platte haben wollte um sie verkaufen zu können. Alles ohne jedes Gefühl. Die Version von ""Wonderful Tonight"" ist ja mal das allerletzte... Als ich seine Version gehört hab ist mir wirklich alles vergangen. ""Wonderful Tonight ist ein Lied das mit Gefühl gesungen werden muss, aber Mike plätschert das runter, frei nach dem Motto: Die Leute heute kaufen eh alles, da wird meine Kommerzkacke schon gut ankommen! Fazit: SCHRECKLICH!"
2,"Ich kann meinem Vorgänger nur recht geben. Lake hat tolle, anspruchsvolle Rockmusik gemacht und diese Zusammenstellung ist auch wirklich gut, zumal sie fast das komplette erste Album beinhaltet. Nun aber zu meiner Entscheidung, der CD nur 2 Sterne zu geben: Der Klang dieser Scheibe ist indiskutabel -  Flach, schrill, keine Transparenz, keine Dynamik. Alles, was klanglich an dieser CD Spaß machen könnte (und das gehört für meinen Geschmack dazu) ist sträflich vernachlässigt worden, sprich keine Spur von Remastering. Selbst das erste Album, klanglich auf CD wahrlich keine Offenbarung, klingt angenehmer als dieses Werk. Hey Sony-Leute, wir haben 2005, da sollte ein anständiges Remastering bei Re-issues doch eigentlich zum guten Ton gehören. Wann kapieren die Plattenfirmen endlich, daß ihre jugendlichen Zielgruppen kein Geld für Musik ausgeben.Diejenigen, die das tun (so wie ich) werden regelmäßig vor den Kopf gestoßen."
1,"Zugegeben, ich bin kein Country-Hörer, aber wenn DASS Country sein soll, finde ich es echt zum lachen!;) Wenn wir jetzt schon soweit sind, dass ABSICHTLICH schlechte Tonqualität zu hören ist, nur damit es nostalgisch und authentisch klingt, eben wie bei der Provinz-Country-Band, ist das schon ziemlich unverschämt, finde ich! Käufer und wahre Künster werden zu Kommerzzwecken missbraucht! Norah, bitte beglücke uns NICHT mit einem dritten ""Meisterwerk"" der Ruhe und Tiefgang! Bitte!"
4,"The boss is back, mit einem Album welches sich kompositorisch auf hohem Niveau bewegt. Da das Klangild nicht so differenziert ist, wie bei früheren CDs gibt es einen Stern Abzug."
2,"Gut, Bon Jovi war schon immer Mainstream, aber auf den vorigen Scheiben gab es immer Lieder drauf, mit denen man herzhaft mitsingen konnte: Rockige Ohrwurm-Lieder mit einem knackigen Sound. Die neue CD ist leider nicht so: Sie hat einen leichten Country Sound (gerade gegen Ende der CD) und besitzt einfach keinen Kracher. Irgendwie plätschert alles vor sich hin und man glaubt irgendwie alles schonmal, aber nur besser, gehört zu haben. Mir gefällt die neue CD nicht - würde ich der ""Have a nice Day"" 5 Punkte geben, so gebe ich dieser macimal 2 Punkte...leider."
1,"Ich schreibe diese Zeilen während ich gerade Harvester of Sorrow Vom and Justice for all Album höre und könnte gerade vor der Genialität dieses Songs niederknien. Doch meine Begeisterung verfliegt schnell wenn ich an die Personen denke die einst solche Quantensprünge hinlegten als wäre es das selbstverständlichste auf der Welt. Als ich Anfang 2003 in einem Interview mit James Hetfield las das Metallica zu ihren Wurzeln zurückkehren wollen wurde ich hellhörig. Hetfield sagte sogar das sie an die and Justice for all Ära anknüpfen wollen und quasi mit dem neuen Album (St. Anger) dort einsteigen wo and Justice for all aufgehört hat.  Um ehrlich zu sein stieg meine Euphorie auf ein neues Hoch wie ich es selten erlebt habe. Doch dieses mal war ich vorsichtiger als bei Load (das ich blind gekauft habe), dieses mal wollte ich hören was die vier Jungs da fabriziert haben und mir verschlug es fast die Sprache. Nicht vor Begeisterung, sondern eher wegen dem Schock wie tief diese ehemaligen guten Musiker gesunken waren. Ab diesem Zeitpunkt war mir klar: Metallica sind endgültig Tod! Als ich mir dann noch den Film Some Kind of Monster ansah wurde mir klar warum Metallica musikalisch nichts mehr auf die Reihe bringen und nur noch ein Haufen labiler und abgehobener Rockstars sind. R.I.P. Metallica 1983 - 1988"
5,"Sicherlich kann ich den echten Judas Priest Fan verstehen, wenn er sagt, dass das da nicht mehr seine Band ist. Ich war allerdings nie ein Priest Fan. Deswegen kann ich auch mit Fug und recht behaupten, dass das was ich hier gehört habe, das Beste ist was sie jemals auf Silber gebrannt haben. Sicher Halford nervt ab und an (aber das macht er meiner nach immer) und die Gitarren sind ein wenig in den Hintergrund getreten, dennoch hat mir dieses Doppelalbum super gefallen. Das Songwriting ist sehr ausgewogen. Für mich klingt das Ganze ein wenig nach Kamelot (nur ein wenig) und Kamelot finde ich super, weswegen es 5 Sterne gibt."
1,"Man muss schon mit einer gehörigen Portion ""Fanblindheit"" geschlagen sein, um Nostradamus etwas Positves abgewinnen zu können. Das schreibe ich als Fan, der selbst Turbo und Ram It Down noch etwas Gutes abringen konnte. Mit Nostradamus suhlen sich Judas Priest am Bodensatz der eigenen Kreativität, strecken und dehnen die handvoll guten Ideen auf zwei Silberlingen zu einer (auch soundtechnisch) dünnen Masse, die sie selbst zu Turbo-Zeiten keinem Fan vorgesetzt hätten. Aber hört und schreibt Euch Nostradamus ruhig schön..."
2,"Ich persönlich bin kein Fan von Avril Lavigne noch von ihrer Musik, muss aber dennoch sagen das, dass Album für eine Newcomerin ganz gut geworden ist. Die Texte sind Pubertär und die Hintergrund Musik ist sehr poppig. Ich höre da nichts an Rock oder Punk, was sie ja bekanntlich immer gern vorgibt zu sein. Aber für das Genre Pop ist das Album eines der besten!"
4,"Meiner Meinung nach ist Juli Überhaupt nicht mit Wir sind Helden zu vergleichen! Juli hat sehr sehr schöne Texte und Melodien was bei Silbermond und Wir sind Helden nicht der Fall ist! ""kurz vor der Sonne"" ist ein absolut geiles Lied wenn da nur der komische Schluss nicht wäre... Trotzdem ist das Album einfach Super!"
1,"Möglichst verbraucherfreundliche Texte wie immer, Naiv-Pop-Gedudel abgekupfert bei Zweiraumwohnung (man vergleiche mal den Aufbau von 'Spiel mit' und 'Willst Du Mit Mir Gehen') - funktioniert eben als Hit, und das ist der alternden Frau eben das Wichtigste, und um die Geld-Mach-Maschinerie nicht zu enttarnen, wird noch schnell die zweite CD reingepackt, die qualitativ gesehen von einer Million, zugegebenermaßen unbekannten Künstlern besser gemacht wird... Schade, dass sowas funktioniert. Grönemeyer hat mal gesagt, man verliert nach 'ner Weile seine künstlerische Unschuld, aber der tut wenigstens was dagegen und versucht sich immer mal wieder an Neuem, dafür reichts bei Ewig-Jung-Nena offensichtlich nicht... Und alle rennen los und kaufen sich den Mist. Hier könnte unsere Renate Künast doch mal endlich wirklich die Verbraucher vor was Üblem bewahren...  'kopfschüttelnd ins Wochenende gehend'..."
1,"...von Earth, Wind&amp;Fire, füge Scootertypisch MickeyMouseVoice und ""Wicked"" Gebrüll hinzu, fertich ist der Hit? Nuja, es wird verkaufstechnisch so sein, doch glaub ich; Selbst unter Trance DJ's und Produzenten ist das eher das letzte, keine eigenen Ideen einzubringen.  Das lieber HBK hätte Push besser hinbekommen, so es überhaupt sinnig ist, Weekend zu sampeln!!!!"
2,"Also, ............ich habe mir das Album angehört und leider feststellen müssen, dass die meisten Lieder (bis auf ""dani california"", ""snow"" und ""tell me baby"") nicht so der Bringer sind. insgesamt sprengt dieses Album mit 18 Liedern also nicht den Rahmen meiner Erwartungen!! Das einzig Gute an diesem Album scheint mir die außergewöhnlich schöne Gestaltung der cds und des Covers zu sein.  aber das sollte bei einem Rhcp- Album ja eigentlich nicht alles sein.  insgesamt: es gehört definitiv nicht zu meinen Empfehlungen!!"
5,"So lange, wie es vielen eingefleischten Fans wohl erschien, dauerte die schöpferische Pause von Alternative-König Billy Corgan keineswegs. Gerade mal knapp 2 Jahre hat er sich Zeit gelassen, nach der Auflösung „seiner"" Kultband, den Smashing Pumpkins, eine neue Band zu gründen und ein Album zu produzieren, das nun endlich vorliegt - die Wartezeit auf „Mary Star of the Sea"" hat sich letztlich doch gezogen. Die Frage ist jedoch nicht, ob Zwan den Erfolg der Smashing Pumpkins fortsetzt, sondern vielmehr, ob Zwan einen eigenen Stil etablieren kann, der sich von dem alten Stil der Kürbisse weiterentwickelt hat, wenn nicht distanziert."
5,"jaja, als ich das 1. mal 'that time of the year (danke rolling stone) hörte, haute es mich um, ist echt mein persönlicher hammersong. aber auch der rest ist genial, was nur 5 points zulässt! kaufen kaufen kaufen, ist echt ein guter (geheim-)tipp."
1,"Ohne Wiederekennungswert, langweilig, klingt wie 1000 andere vor ihr. Die Stimme ist nichts Besonderes - Durchschnitt. Das Geld lieber an die hungernden Kinder in Afrika schicken - hat mehr Sinn - als für die wertlose Lisa-Musik zu verschwenden. Noch mehr Müll auf dem Musikmarkt. Nicht kaufen."
5,"Auch die Ausgabe 20 kann sich durchaus hören ( und sehen ) lassen - bietet sie doch ( wie gewohnt ) die besten NEUEN Songs aus der ganzen Welt, die man so halt als Schwuler gerne hört und wo man nach tanzen möchte. Und da ist es auch ganz normal, daß alte Dance-Klassiker mal eben nicht ( in den tausendmal ausgelutschten ) Versionen gebracht werden, sondern eben in den Fassungen, wie sie HEUTE in den Clubs und Discos laufen.Die ollen Dinger haben wir doch alle schon auf hunderten von Kopplungen und deshalb ist es gut bei GAY HAPPENING, daß sie die nicht auch noch auf die aktuellen Ausgaben packen, sondern dafür dann eben ihre Sonderausgaben ( Golden Disco Classics etc. ) haben. Wer also frische Musik zum abfeiern und mitsingen haben will, für den ist die GAY HAPPENING immer noch das ideale Futter...Klasse sind auch immer die Bonus-Videotrax - hier vom Underwear Fashion Label teamm8 aus Australien ( da gibt es lecker was für die Augen )..und wo findet man sowas ansonsten auf anderen Gay-CDs ????? Auf weitere 20 Jahre mit Gay Happening ( die Serie wurde bereits 1991 gestartet )"
4,"Der Star-Search Sieger präsentiert sich auch in seinem ersten Album als wahrer Sieger. Seine Stimme und Ausstrahlung konnte ja schon während der TV-Sendung überzeugen, und genauso zeigt er in diesem Album nochmal all sein Können. Leider merkt man gerade in den ersten Liedern, die alle ein wenig einfallslos und daher nicht herausragend wirken, dass das Album sehr schnell produziert wurde, aber dafür überzeugt die zweite Hälfte des Albums absolut. Mit Rock-Klassikern wie ""Nothing Else Matters"" oder Tracks wie ""Am Fenster"" gewinnt Martin alle Sympathien, und ""All For Love"" mit Thomas Wohlfarth und Michael Wurst erzeugt Gänsehaut pur. Alles in allem ist dieses Album ein echter Kauftipp!! Gerade der Punkt, dass ein solches Album so schnell hervorgezaubert wurde, zeigt, welch großes Potential in diesem Künstler steckt. Ich denke auf seine nächsten Alben können wir uns wirklich freuen."
1,"Ich bein kein bekennender Deutsch-Hiphop-Fan, in sofern mag der eine oder andere meine Meinung eh nicht ernst nehmen. Ich hatte ""7"" damals eher aus Langeweile gekauft und war schnell verfallen: Beats, Flow, Lyrics, alles durchdacht und wirklich von Track zu Track individuell. Und genau das fehlt mir auf ""Heavy Metal Payback"": Die Texte sind alle irgendwo gleich... zwischen ""Ich f""&amp;$ Deine Mutter"" über ""Ich bin böse"" über ""Ich disse Sido"" und so weiter und so weiter. Das Visionäre von ""7"" fehlt völlig. Und dann die ewig gleiche Untermalung... der Flow gluckst so vor sich hin, aber es steht kein Track heraus. Und dann - Kommerzialisierung hin oder her - das Feature mit Karel Gott. Hätte man was draus machen können. Sobald die tschechische Amsel aber in seinem ""Und diese Biene, die ich meine...""-Stil die deutsche Version des Refrains von AlphavilleŽs ""Forever Young"" verhunzt, dann wird zumindest mir klar: Das war nix... der Grat zwischen Kommerz und Strasse kann funktionieren, aber dazu bedarf es Kreativität... und die fehlt hier."
4,"Dies ist ein sehr gutes Symphonic Metal Album - aber leider nicht mehr. ""Once"" hat nicht mehr den Zauber der Vorgängeralben. Es fehlen die kraftvollen Songs wie ""Elvenpath"", ""Stargazers"" oder ""Wishmaster"" (bitte jetzt nicht ""kraftvoll"" mit ""laut und hart"" verwechseln). Auch die ruhigeren Stücke reichen nicht an ""Angels fall first"", ""Sleeping Sun"" oder ""Swanheart"" heran. Tarjas Stimme wird im Vergleich mit ""Century Child"" nochmals deutlich verhaltener eingesetzt. Zudem harmonieren die Stimmen von Tarja und Marco nicht mehr so gut wie auf ""Century Child"". Es ist zu bedauern, daß Nightwish sich offenbar vom Opera Metal verabschiedet hat."
1,"Wo U2 draufsteht ist auch U2 drin???Leider nicht,denn dieses Album hier ist eine Frechheit und hält Vergleichen mit wirklich bahnbrechenden U2 Alben,wie WAR,THE UNFORGETABLE FIRE oder natürlich THE JOSHUA TREE überhaupt nicht stand!Das hier klingt alles wie in 2Minuten komponiert!Frage mich auch ernsthaft,wer auf dieser Cd Hymnen findet????BAD oder SUNDAY BLOODY SUNDAY oder das gesamte THE JOSHUA TREE Album,DAS sind Hymnen!Das hier ist Müll,leider Müll,der sich wieder super verkaufen wird und sämtliche Charts der Welt anführen wird aber nicht weil es musikalisch überzeugend ist,was hier zu hören ist,sondern weil U2 draufsteht!!Warum versuchen U2 plötzlich krampfhaft jung zu klingen??Schade U2 hatte wirklich auf einen weiteren Meilenstein gehofft,hat ja lang genug bis zur VÖ gedauert aber das hier ist nix!Dann doch lieber COLDPLAY,die ihren Vorbildern immer weiter enteilen und wirklich innoative Veröffentlichungen bieten.Schade U2,evtl doch Zeit für die Rente?Denn so versaut sich eine große Band ihren Ruf!"
2,"Ich kann mir nicht helfen, aber ich werd und werd nicht warm mit der CD. Ansonsten schätze ich Rhapsody sehr, auch wenn ich Luca Turrili für, sagen wir, etwas eingebildet halte. Seine ""Emerald Sword Saga"" ist beiweitem nicht soooo toll, dass man a) so stolz drauf sein kann und b) ganze Alben darum strickt. Und genau da liegt der Knackpunkt: Wäre das Textkonzept wie bei den ersten CDs ""nur"" schmückendes Beiwerk und die Musiker hätten sich auf die Musik konzentriert, wäre wohl mehr rauszuholen gewesen. Aber so? Nee."
2,na wenn das mal kein glück ist?es ist immer wieder schön zu sehen und zu hören wie man leute die singen und oder ein instrument spielen können (zb richard) aus den popstars rauswirft.naja richard hat familie.aber dennoch ist musik sein leben.und er kann.stattdessen nimmt man püppchchen und blondies die nur sexy sind.ich finde die musik nicht schlecht.aber leider ist sie nicht wirklich von den neuen popstars sondern von den geld geilen menschen dahinter.ach waren das noch zeiten als die gitarren noch krachten und die drums nur so umherflogen.könnte man denn nicht mal eine keller band produzieren?mit eigenen songs?NEIN.wie viele meiner vorgänger schon sagen kann man versuchen anschluss zu finden an within temptation usw aber warum probieren sie nicht mal was neues?ich bin selbst musiker und weiss wie schwer es ist einen song zu schreiben und zu recorden.aber trotzdem hat doch jeder seinen eigenen stil.wo sind die schönen gitarren solos allá steve vai?GELD GELD GELD
2,"Ich hatte mir ehrlich gesagt sehr viel mehr erhofft. Bis jetzt habe ich mir einmal komplett das Album angehört, nachdem ich lange darauf gewartet hab. ""Shame"" und ""Even Heaven Cries"" sind echt die mit Abstand besten Songs. Ich muss mir schwer überlegen, ob ich ein zweites Album - falls die ""Band"" überhaupt solange existiert - kaufen würde."
1,"Schreien bis das Trommelfell platzt.....genau dieses verkörpert Lisas CD...  Mit dieser CD wurde keine Sängerin sondern eine Marktschreierin geboren.  Der Charteinstieg und der kommende Abgang wird ihr hoffentlich die Augen öffnen............  PS: Wenn ein Herr Bohlen so eine CD sowie Album produzieren würde, hätten sie ihn gesteinigt.... 0 Sterne für CD und Album..."
5,"Kniet nieder, beugt euer Haupt, denn TOOL sind zurück, um uns ein weiteres Meisterwerk ihres Schaffens vorzulegen. Lateralus ist das konsequente und trotzdem unerwartete Ergebnis aus den drei vorhergehenden Alben, vielmehr ist es die verdichtete Essenz all dessen, was diese Band ausmacht: eine treibende wie vertrackte Rhytmussektion, messerscharfe wie gefühlvolle Gitarrenriffs und die über allem schwebende, fast transzendentale Stimme Keenans. Lateralus besitzt die Aggressivität und Bösartigkeit aus Opiate und Undertow, als auch die Tiefe und Kunstfertigkeit Aenimas, und tritt den Beweis an, dass man nach langem Wandern durch die Finsternis letztendlich das Licht erreicht. Herrschte auf Aenima noch der Wunsch vor, die Welt mit Hilfe eines allumfassenden Einlaufs von all ihren Wiederwärtigkeiten zu reinigen um neu anzufangen, baut Lateralus virtuos auf diesem Neubeginn auf. Dieses Album ist für toolsche Verhältnisse, bei aller Düsternis und Härte, beinahe hoffnungsvoll und von strahlender, fast schwereloser Schönheit. All this pain is an illusion, aus der schmerzgeplagten schwarzen Raupe ist ein schillernder faszinierender Schmetterling geworden, der uns hineinzieht in das Spiel, das Tool mit unseren Gehirnhälften treibt. Also, zurücklehnen, Augen schliessen und lateralisieren lassen ..."
1,"This is Madonna's last record for Warner, i think Madonna experiment a new style to see how far could she go, Good or Bad she had nothing to lose... beside a couple of million fans that followed her since the beginning of her carrier. Rumors saying that with this album she is trying gaining back her straight odiens tired of being associate with the Homosexual scene. in my opinion everyone should stick on what they know best. OK R&amp;B is ""cool"" right now, but is it the right choice for madonna ? or lets turn tables... Can you Immagine Eminem singing Material Girl or Like a virgin. This Madonna's album is not for the fans.  i listeng to it 4 time trying to like it.... i was number 1 madonna's fan but this album is worse than the  American Life Flop, it is monotone, passive, boring, in some part annoyng and almost disturbing..... Dont waist your Money."
1,"Die Begeisterung für diese Künstlerin kann ich leider nicht nachvollziehen. Ich habe selten ein so langweiliges monotones Album gehört. Vielleicht ist dieses Album die Offenbarung für Jazz Fans, aber ich kann weder mit der Stimme noch mit der Musik irgendetwas anfangen."
4,Rundum gute Musik. Wer Udo mag kann hier nichts falsch machen. Jedoch sind die Songs auch für nicht Udo Fans geeignet.
2,"Auch ich habe begeistert die ZDF-Gala gesehen und mir am nächsten Tag die CD zugelegt. Leider muss ich mich meinen Vorrednern anschliessen und bin enttäuscht von dieser Produktion. Nichts gegen Uwe Kröger, er singt toll und ist einer der grössten Musicalstars Deutschlands, aber weiss Gott nicht der Einzige. Wo zum Beispiel war Andreas Bieber als ""der"" Joseph überhaupt ? Warum muss Uwe Kröger (und dann auch noch auf englisch) das Thema aus ""Joseph"" singen ??? Versprochen waren alle 50 vorgestellten Lieder, leider hat eine ganze Menge gefehlt. Und die Besetzung war auch gewöhnungsbedürftig mit Kristina Bach und Roger Whittaker. Schade, die CD hätte wirklich besser sein können."
1,"Etwas Gutes muss man dieser CD lassen : Wenn man sie gehört hat weiß man definitiv, das man nie mehr ein neues ""Depeche Mode"" Album kaufen wird. Warum habe ich mir in den 80er alle Depeche Mode Alben gekauft ? Weil sie so super tanzbar waren und richtig harte Beats hatten !! Seit dem Ausstieg von Alan Wilder hat sich die Band komplett diesem merkwürdigem Psycho - Sound verschrieben den Sie zur Zeit machen : Martin Gore soll doch seine Depressionen woanders ausleben als in meinem Gehör! Fassungslos höre ich dann solche Schrott Songs wie ""Macrovision"" oder ""Damaged People"" und frage mich, wer sich diesen Vollquatsch tatsächlich anhört : Vor allem an langer Weile nicht mehr zu überbieten. Und wenn die CD nicht von Depeche Mode wäre : Wirklich niemand auf der Welt würde von dem Geheule Notiz nehmen."
2,"Über einen seinerzeit berühmten Popstar namen Christopher Cross gab weiland ein kluger Mensch zum besten: ""Jede(r) hat ihn im Schrank, und keine(r) weiss, warum!"" Bei Norah Jones geht es mir mindestens genauso. Zugegeben, ich habe bisher noch nicht die Schicksalsergebenheit aufgebracht, mir dieses grandios nichtssagende Album öfter als 4x anzuhören - so hat sich mir die wahre Grösse dieses braven Fräuleins wahrscheinlich noch nicht offenbaren können.  Nur eines muss man ihr lassen: sie polarisiert nicht - entweder man findet sie toll, oder man schläft ein. Und besser als Nicole ist sie allemal, und die hat mit ""Ein bisschen Frieden"" seinerzeit immerhin den Grand Prix d'Eurovision gewonnen. Dennoch, ich halte den Norah Jones Hype zumindest für ein seltsames Missverständnis. Verstehe einer die Welt...."
5,"Die ultimative Rhythmusmachine ist wieder bereit um sämtliche Partys aufzumischen, Konzerthallen auszuverkaufen, Rock and Roll Rekorde zu brechen und dem Jungvolk zu zeigen wo der Bartel den Most herholt.  Die wievielte Generation an Nachwuchsrockern dürfte das denn jetzt schon sein, welche von Angus Youngs wildem Gitarrenritt für immer für die Gesellschaft versaut werden?  Egal, man soll nicht vergessen das es teilweise schon zum Sport wurde über die letzten beiden Scheibe Ballbreaker"" und Stiff Upper Lip"" herzuziehen, dabei waren die weitaus besser als ihnen Jahre später angedichtet wurde. Der Érfolg gab ihnen Recht und noch heute summt jeder Depp die Melodien zu Hail To Ceasar"" oder Save In New York City"" mit. So mies können sie also wirklich nicht gewesen sein.  Aber Black Ice"" ist tatsächlich noch mal von ganz anderem Schrot und Korn. Ich lehne mich bestimmt nicht zu weit aus dem Fenster, wenn ich die Scheibe als die hochwertigste AC/DC Langrille seit Razors Edge"" bezeichne. Und das obwohl hier kein Thunderstruck"" vertreten ist. Braucht es auch gar nicht, denn schwere Boogie- und Bluesrock Knüller wie War Machine"", Anything Goes"", Wheels""....man könnte hier im Grunde (bis auf das etwas abfallende She Likes Rock ŽnŽ Roll"" und Money Made"") die komplette Trackliste posten, reißen einem nicht nur den Hintern um einen halben Meter weiter auf.  Die Luftgitarren werden Glühen, Nackenwirbel werden bersten, ein Meer von Pommesgabeln wird sich erheben und die Kids werden wieder anfangen sich die Haare über die Schultern wachsen zu lassen.  Wie zur Hölle schafft es diese Band nach all den Jahren immer wieder so ein Pfund nachzulegen, während der Konkurrenz langsam die Luft ausgeht. So ganz stimmt das auch nicht, ist 2008 ja im Hardrockbereich das veröffentlichungsstärkste Jahr seit fast zwei Dekaden.  Erstaunlich finde ich das tatsächlich nahe an Razors Edge"" musiziert wird (obwohl Phil Rudd natürlich tausend mal besser zum simplen aber effektiven Sound von AC/DC passt als der ebenfalls bärenstarke Chris Slade), dabei aber eine Atmosphäre aufgebaut wird die frappierend an die Werke zwischen 1985 und 1990 erinnert.  Das die eindeutigen Hits, zu denen man beim ersten mal hören schon mitgrölen kann fehlen, das wird sich evtl. sogar noch als großer Vorteil für die Scheibe heraus stellen. So widmet der Hörer dem Album in seiner Gesamtheit mehr Aufmerksamkeit und das macht sich hier wirklich bezahlt.  Brian Johnson klingt noch immer wie ein Zuchtbulle mit 17 lockeren Bier im Wanst, während Angus und Malcom einen Gitarrenklang erschaffen wie es sonst kein Bruderpaar der Welt schafft. Dazu gibt es noch die wohl tighteste Rhytmusfraktion der Welt und fertig ist ein Gebilde die mit Black Ice"" eindeutig belegt das man mit schwitzigem Hardrock noch heute die größten Erfolge feiern und alle Venues ausverkaufen kann.  Black Ice"" ist das Gegenteil eines Gerontoalbums und klingt dennoch reif und aus einem Guss. Die Australier haben sich mal so ganz locker wieder an die Spitze der Szene katapultiert und zweigen dem jungen Gemüse wie es geht.  AC/DC brauchen nicht die Welt, aber die Welt braucht AC/DC. Amen!"
5,"Ein Robbie Williams, wie ihn kaum einer kennt! Man hört an jedem Song, dass er Spaß bei den Aufnahmen hatte und stolz ist auf seine Leistung! Die Arbeit mit Duffy wirkt sich EXTREM positiv auf seine Musik aus! Besonders Lovelight schreit nach Sex! Man möchte in den CD-Player kriechen und ihn ins Bett zerren!  Aber auch She's Madonna, Good Doctor, Never touch that switch, We're the Pet Shop Boys und Kiss me sind wahre tiefgehende Songs! Zuletzt möchte ich noch ""Viva life on Mars"" erwähnen, das mit zu den besten Stücken des Albums zählt! Fazit: Ich kann nur jedem empfehlen, dieses Album zu kaufen. Ihr werdet positiv überrascht sein!"
2,"Ist ja ganz nett was die vier Finnen da abliefern, aber gab's das nicht schon tausend mal? Meine Schwester hat sich das Album gekauft, nachdem ich mir ""in the shadows"" wochenlang, zwangsweise anhören musste (und grausam fand). Also habe ich mir die CD mal ausgeliehen um zu hören, warum gerade soviel Wirbel um diese Band gemacht wird. Nach ein paar Durchläufen stand fest: UAAAaaah langweilig!!! Die Lieder funktionieren (fast) immer nach dem gleichen Prinzip: - Stimmfokussierte Strophen, meistens mit leichten Elektronikeinlagen - Stimmungsvolles Ohrwurmrefrains - Und dann nach 2x Stophe 2x Refrain ebenso leichtverdauliche Breaks. Die zwei Sterne gibt's für die halbwegs anhörbaren Stücke ""time to burn"" (Unglaublich!!! Sie haben Mut zur Chromatik.) und ""funeral song"". Wer auf anspruchsvollen Rock steht, sollte sich lieber Diorama von Silverchair holen. Alle die sich mit billiger Fahrstuhlmusik zufrieden geben, die man nach zweimal hören mitträllern kann, für die gibt es keine bessere Scheibe."
5,"Bist du ein Fan von Christina? Nein? Dann solltest du aber schleunigst einer werden! Ihre Musik ist unvermechselbar und ihre Stimme EINMALIG. Du wirst sehen, wie diese Musik dich verzaubert. Für mich ist es immer ein Vergnügen, wenn ich diese CD höre. Ich lege mich in mein Bett, schließe die Augen und höre einfach nur dieser atemberaubenden Musik zu. Ich freue mich schon riesig auf ihre kommende DVD. Ich hoffe du wirst auch bald ein großer Fan von ihr sein. Ich kann nur noch sagen Chritina ist die ALLERBESTE und stellt alle in den Schatten!!"
1,"Wie schon der Tietel meiner Rezession sagt:Dieses Album ist einfach nur mieß! Auf dem ganzen Album ist kein einziges lied das wirklich herausstechen würde, ein richtiger Ohrwurm..........stattdessen schallt einem langweiliger, überdrehter Mainstream Punk aus den Boxen entgegen-dieses Album ist kein Genuss! Wenn man sich zb die erste Single anhört, die gleichnamig dem Album ist mag man meinen das es sich dabei um einen Lichtblick des Albums handelt-vergleiche ich jedoch diesen Song mit einem Song wie ""Savior"" oder ""Prayer Of The Refugee"" von Rise Against-dann wird es ganz schnell ziemlich peinlich für Green Day. zwar hat Green Day sicher viel mehr Platten verkauft, an die Energie der Musik und die Message solcher Texte kommt Green Day NIEMALS auch nur annähernd heran! Deshalb: Finger Weg von diesem Album!"
5,"Ich hatte die Möglichkeit mir Lisas Single ""Learn to love you"" anzuhören. Nach der ersten Hörprobe war ich etwas enttäuscht aber nach dem dritten bzw. vierten Mal fand ich den Song einfach nur noch geil. Und jetzt liebe ich ihn. Megastimme mit ganz viel Gefühl und Power, besonderes dann, wenn Lisa richtig aufdreht. Der Refrain geht nicht sofort ins Ohr. Man muss den Song mehrmals hören um mitsingen zu können. Daher an alle: Den Song von Lisa müsst ihr mindestens zwei oder dreimal hören und dann lässt er euch nicht mehr los. Und nicht nur einmal hören und was negatives darüber schreiben. Das gilt nicht!!! Ich kann nur eins sagen: Kaufen, kaufen, kaufen... Ich freue mich schon auf das kommende Album. P.s Übrigens enthält die Maxi Single noch den Titel"" Flugzeuge im Bauch"", den Lisa damals gänsehautmäßig bei DSDS gesungen hat."
5,"Als ich gestern diese Scheiben mal wieder gehört habe, hatte ich nicht Gänsehaut, nein Elefantenhaut! Das ist House in seiner ursprünglichsten Art. Das war die Spitze des Eisbergs! Damals hatte House seinen Höhepunkt erreicht, kurz bevor er kommerziell wurde. Clubmusik reinster Form. Und Daniel Klein mixt jenseits aller Grenzen! Deep, depper, am deppsten......rooted. Diese Art von House, konnte man damals NUR in Hamburg hören und zwar nur im legänderem FRONT oder damligem OHR ( jetzigem EDK). Das gilt auch für die Definition of House Vol.2. Man müsste eigentlich diese ja fast schon ""Zeitzeugen"" der Musikgeschichte, in einen vakuum versiegelten Panzerschrank auf den Mond schießen, damit sie für die nachfolgenden Generationen für immer erhalten bleibt. Wer diese Tracks nicht kennt, hat den House verpennt. ...Niemand sonst außer uns kann es sehen oder verstehen."
1,"Ich mag ihre Songs sonst sehr- aber hier stimmt einfach gar nichts. Falscher Song , kein Rhythmus - einfach nur langweilig. Schade, falsch beraten. Man sollte nicht alles annehmen in der Meinung, es sei passend!"
2,"Das Album ist ein Mix aus ca. neun ""echten"" Songs und ausufernden, hörspielartigen Zwischenspielen der Marke ""Richard Wagner"", die oft in übertriebenen Synthesizer Orgien enden. Die kitschigen Texte ist man ja gewohnt, leider musste man bei den alten Alben nur 1-2 solcher Zwischenspiele überspringen. Es nervt wenn man endlich mit dem 3.Track einen geilen Song ""King of Kings"" bekommt dann aber wieder das nächste Hörstück (die meistens über 5 Minuten lang sind) überspringen muss. Oft wird nur geredet anstatt gesungen. Die richtigen ""Lieder"" dann sind aber wieder gut gelungen, wie ""Loki god of fire"", oder ""Blood brothers"". Leider fehlt mir der richtige Stampfer der gleich beim ersten Mal ins Ohr geht (wie beim letzten richtigen Album Warriors of the World united) Als Fazit kann man sagen von den 16 Tracks hättete man getrost die Hälfte weglassen können, wobei ja auch noch die Tracks der Vorab EP ""Sons of Odin"" auf dieser CD enthalten sind. Dann hätten wir wie früher 8-9 Lieder wovon 1 oder 2 Zwischenstücke sind. Für mich ist diese CD eine leichte Enttäuschung aber die ""hartgesottenen"" Manowarjünger werden es wohl lieben. Alle anderen Metalfans sei ein vorab anhören dieser CD zu raten !"
5,"Ich habe das Album nun schon so oft gehört, und es ist mir noch kein bischen über geworden! Die Tracks sind einfach genial, die Instrumente perfekt aufeinander abgestimmt, die Lieder total verschieden und zu jeder Stimmung passend! Sowohl langsamere, traurigere Lieder wie Solider Side und Lost in Hollywood, als auch energiereiche starke Songs wie Cigaro, B.Y.O.B. oder This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song sind auf der CD! Die Platte eignet sich meiner Meinung nach auch für Leute, die System of a Down sonst nicht so gerne mögen, weil sie anders ist als z.B. Toxicity!"
5,"Ich kenne Evanescence schon ewig lange und war schon immer von ihnen begeistert... Auf das Album hab ich sehnsüchtig gewartet; wobei ich nicht damit gerechnet habe, dass die Band nach dem Kauf meine Lieblingsband wird =) Sie haben wohl ein Fabel für Ohrwurmsongs ;) Amy Lee schwankt mit ihrer Stimme immer zwischen der finnischen Tarja Turunen von Nightwish und der Italienerin Cristina Scabbia von Lacuna Coil. Evanescence mischen gefühlvollen Gesang mit megamäßigen Melodien und geilen Gitarrenriffs. Höchstens Lacuna Coil können in ihren besten Momenten noch eine Atmosphäre wie Evanescence darstellen. KAUFEN !!"
1,"Bei Sounding the Seventh Trumpet, Waking the Fallen und City of Evil war Avenged Sevenfold noch etwas besonderes, viele Lieder aus diesen Alben sind für mich jetzt schon einfach nur Kult und immer wieder gerne anzuhören. Aber das neue Album, welchen ironischerweise auch noch Self-titled ist, kann mit absolut nichts überzeugen. Die Texte sind nicht mehr ansatzweise nachdenklich, die Gitarrenriffs sind lahm, der Gesang irgendwie auch 08/15....  Der Fall einer großartigen Band hat begonnen..."
1,"wo sind all die genialen einfälle eines michael jackson hin? wer nicht gerade fan ist, möchte das ganze entweder als ulk abtun oder seine nervenfestigkeit testen. schade. was war das mal für ein musiker!"
1,Leider hat sich einer der hottesten Rapper Frankreichs in die Durchschnittlichkeit gerappt. Fast alle Raps und Tracks klingen gleich. Dann lieber in Rohffs La Vie Avant la Mort reinhören!
4,"Eine völlig geistesgestörte Band aus Kalifornien, die es schafft, ihre unvereinbaren Vorlieben für klassisch Testosteron-betriebenen Enghosen-Metal, kargen Punk und dudeligen Prog-Rock auf eine glaubwürdige, frische und originelle Weise doch zu vereinbaren. Erstaunliches Album."
5,"Endlich ist es soweit nach langer Zeit kommt wieder ein neues Album der Band Limp Bizkit (matschiger Keks) heraus. In diesem Album sind ungewohnt viele ""Softi"" Lieder drauf. Aber trozdem hörenswert. Unter anderem ein Coversong von der Band THE WHO (Behind Blue Eyes). Für einen echten Limp Bizkit Fan ein muss. Man findet sich in einer ganz anderen stimmungsvolleren Musik wieder.KAUFEN! Sowas nennt man gute Investition!!!"
1,Ich mag die Cd nicht ich weiss nicht wieso aber die lieder sind einfach nicht die eigentlich von madonna  mah nur ein lied candy store aber der rest ist gesmachssache!
5,"ich für meinen teil bin total von dem album überzeugt! find es klar besser als 7 und auf dem niveau von ""vom bordstein bis zur skyline"" und ""von der skyline zum bordstein zurück"" (die besten bushido alben wie ich finde) das album hält was der name und bushidos ansagen verspricht! es wird gnadenlos abgerechnet...vor allem 4,3,2,1 (vielen Dank Aggro Berlin), Hai Life und Boomerang sind hier hervorzuheben leider gibt es auch wieder das ein oder andere lied das man sich hätte sparen können...bei liedern wie so ghetto o.ä. kann ich durchaus so manmche kritik an bushido verstehen denn diese lieder sind sehr einfallslos auf dem immer gleichen beat... trotzdem überwiegt das positive...natürlich benutzt bushido oft das wort ""ghetto"" aber is das nicht auch auf fast jedem anderen rap album so? ich hab alle alben von bushido (außer die indizierten) daheim im regal und trotzdem fühle ich mich nicht gelangweilt...klar 2 oder 3 tracks sind auch auf diesem album langweilig aber das positive überwiegt doch sehr. die orchester beats, wenn man das so nennen kann, sind einfach der oberhammer...die klingen vor allem auf ""jenny"" und ""für immer jung"" einfach sehr eindrucksvoll und es ist was neues die gefühlvollen lieder gefallen mir auch sehr...mit flugh lh... kann ich mich persönlich nicht wirklich identifizieren, aber für immer jung, jenny, bonny &amp; clide, die letzte träne und ich hoffe dir geht es gut sind einfach genial! die features überzeugen auch (fast) alle...nyze und bizzy montana haben mich richtig positiv überrascht...chakuza is sowieso der knaller...das karel gott feature war auch sehr gut wie auch das von cassandra steen...lediglich mit den lied nit kay one kann ich nichts anfangen...und olli pocher is natürlich zu genial! alles in allem ein hammer album das ich jedem bushido fan nur ans herz legen kann und auch viele nicht bushido fans oder normale rap hörer werden an dem album ihren spaß finden...hab au n paar kumpels von einigen liedern überzeugen können beste lieder: für immer jung, bonny &amp; clide, boomerang, hai life, ich hoffe dir geht es gut und auf den deluxe editions hass und kennt ihr die stars"
5,"Ob so vielen Gefühls kann man schon mal ins Schwärmen geraten. Und ob Norah Jones Stil tatsächlich völlig geschmackssicher, noch im rousseauschen Sinne naturverbunden oder schon Edelkitsch ist, das muss die Zeit erweisen. Für mich jedenfalls ist diese Musik eine Entdeckung und jetzt schon fest eingeplant in den Soundtrack meines Sommerurlaubs. So klingt der Sommer. (ach, übrigens: So klingt auch die großartige Holly Cole, mit der ich Norah Jones anfangs immer verwechselt habe, aber das nur am Rande)."
1,"Nachdem ich mir die DVD Secret world live gekauft habe, höre ich mindestens 1 x die Woche diese total geile DVD! Meine Erwartungen waren also hoch und nach 10 Jahren eine ""neue"" CD und dann als SACD - toll.  Aber so etwas von schlecht!!! Klanglich ist jede gebrannte von mir besser und musiklalisch absolut daneben - habe fast einen Schock bekommen! Kann jedem nur empfehlen die DVD zu kaufen und danach nichts mehr - oder vielleicht nur die alten ""Klamotten"". Wer schreibt eigentlich so positive Rezensionen. Schade das man auf so etwas reinfällt."
1,".. deswegen aber auch nicht besser. Eine ähnliche Schnulze hatte der Produzent ja auch für Tobias Regner kreiert - ebenso spannungsarm, ebenso austauschbar und dazu noch ein flaches Stimmchen ohne Wiedererkennungswert einfacher Durchschnitt.   Dieses Liedchen bietet nichts halbes und nichts Ganzes. Es ist einfach nur langweilig und es hört sich ähnlich an wie der Tobias-Regner-Song. Das Geld lieber an die hungernden Kinder in Afrika schicken - hat mehr Sinn - als für die wertlose ROCKER-Musik zu verschwenden. Fazit : Von den total übertriebenen Fan-Rezensionen nicht beirren lassen, denn dieses Produkt ist nicht empfehlenswert. Übrigens, warum verschwinden hier laufend massenweise negative Kritiken an diesem wirklich belanglosen Stück Musik?  Mir kommt das reichlich seltsam vor und riecht stark nach Zensur.  Muss diese CD einfach verkauft werden??? Scheinbar ja, denn es wurden gerade Mal 107000 CDs verkauft. Weniger als der Regner verkaufte. Diese CD erreichte noch nicht einmal den Goldstatus, deswegen wird schnell noch Love Is You/2track Premium hinterher geschoben, um dieses zu erreichen. Deshalb: Spart Euch bei diesem ""ROCK-KÜNSTLER"" die Rezensionen, hier wird Schönfärberei GROß geschrieben...  Rezension vom 10.06.2008"
2,fantastische stimme die aber leider nicht zum lied passt....ein hässlicher schmusesong(bohlen) mit einer fantastischen rockerstimme...wegen der stimme noch 2 sterne
5,"Ich liebe diese CD und es lohnt sich wirklich sie zu kaufen!!!!! Es sind rockige (,,Rules""), ruhige Balladen (,,The One""), latin-pop (,,Whenever,Wherever"") und arabische Klänge (,,Eyes like yours"") vorhanden.So ist für jeden etwas dabei!!!!! Es wundert mich wirklich nicht das diese klasse cd über 25 wochen in den deutschen top-ten war!!!!ich kann sie (wie gesagt) nur weiterempfehlen!!!!"
2,"Zur Gruppe der Anfangspsychedelikern gehörend , behaupte ich einfach , daß WOODEN SHJIPS auf ihren CDs eher - von wenigen Stücken abgesehen - in der langweiligeren Ecke anzusiedeln sind. Ist natürlich völlig subjektiv , oder es liegt am mangelnden Drogenkonsum."
2,"""Hot spaces"" ist für mich das einzig wirklich richtig üble Queen-Album. Was sich bei ""The game"" schon so ein bischen angedeutet hatte, kam hier leider voll zum Ausbruch. Der Zeitgeist hatte sich auch bei dieser Spitzenband durchgesetzt und so war erst mal nichts mehr mit Bombastrock sondern eher mit Mainstream und Disco. ""Under pressure"" mit David Bowie geht grad noch so, aber den Rest kann man aus heutiger Sicht getrost vergessen."
5,"allen die dieser cd keine 4 oder 5 punkte gegeben haben seid gott gnädig es ist der reinste wahnsinn ich bin seit californication ein großer fan von rhcp und habe mir auch die älteren alben gekauft und sie haben mir gefallen und jetzt diese cd der reinste wahnsinn so toll, gut oder weit hat sich noch nie (imo) eine band entwickelt es muß nicht immer das gleiche zeug sein wie auf den anderen alben, anderes kann sehr viel besser oder zumindest genauso gut sein, wie rhcp mit diesem album beweist, nur das erste lied ""by the way"" erinnert mich noch an californication und die anderen alben. kauft euch diese cd und sperrt euch für 1 stunde in euer zimmer ein, am besten wo die sonne schön rein scheint, und lasst euch von dieser cd (qälen oder halt) verwöhnen."
5,"This is the 1st song from an exceptional voice like black velvet, carrying true emotions wrapped in a lovely melody that grows on you and meaningful lyrics. 'Blessed' is only a 1st step for a potential world class singer and entertainer with unique charisma. Especially for those of us who think twice before buying a CD, as to this one there's no choice at all. If you're looking for beauty you'll find it here - both in product and in person, although the term 'product' is almost a sacrilege in this case. Blessed are the lucky ones who realized that they were witnesses of a star being born during those spring weeks, those who were able to watch bigger clouds of stardust coming down to a Cologne stage every week. What seemed like a duckling turned into a swan - especially visible in that suit singing 'blessed'. Fady Maalouf came a long way to help our emotions coming out of their shell and he has every right to accept our gratitude. Any record company not willing to support this artist in the original sense of the word all the way had better ordered hearing aids and guide dogs for their executives. In the long run they would deeply regret not having invested in Monsieur Musique. If you're looking for mediocrity buy any other record, if you're looking for beauty, buy this one."
1,"Ich finde es nicht gut das die CD schreibgeschützt ist, ich bin viel im Internet und höre über den PC Laufwerk CD,S, daswegen werde ich hier keine CD,S mehr kaufen."
2,"Ich vermisse die rockigen, funkigen wilden Songs, wie ich es von Red Hot Chili Peppers gewohnt bin. Es hat zuviele langsame, easy-listening Lieder. Schade!"
2,"War das erste Linkin Park Album noch schlichtweg genial, ist der Nachfolger leider nur ein fader Aufguß. Zwar orientieren sich die Tracks stilistisch an dem Vorgänger und nicht am  Reanimation Album(welches mindestens genauso unnötig war wie Fear Factorys Remanufacture) ,doch hat man stets den Eindruck sich die B-Seiten des ersten Werkes anzuhören. Nun ""quality for money"" bekommt man hier nicht und bei einer Gesammtspielzeit von 35,5 min dürfte auch die ""quantity for money"" eher dürftig ausfallen. Noch ein Track weniger und man könnte sich von der Spielzeit her mit Slayers Reign in Blood messen. Welches aus der Sicht von Linkin Park jedoch so weit über ihnen ist, dass Sie es auch durch aufeinanderstapeln aller verkauften Hybrid Theory CDs nicht erreichen könnten!"
4,"Madonna ist zurück mit dem was sie am besten kann , extrem gute tanzbare Musik . Sie weiss worauf es ankommt . Ihre Stimme unverkennbar und sexy ist sie sowieso . Unbedingt in "" Sorry "" reinhören - ihr nächster Hit !"
2,"Da wären wir also, nach über einem Jahrzehnt ein neues GNR Album. Ich war nie begeistert darüber, dass Axl den Namen behalten hat und die Band neu besetzt hat, der frühere Sound war einfach einmalig. Aber ich war auch so offen zu sagen, wenn dieses Album mir musikalisch gefällt geb ich ihm eine Chance. Was ich erwartet habe war ein fach ein Album das sich noch nach GNR anhört, auch mit neuer Besetzung.  Was soll ich sagen meine Erwartungen wurden enttäuscht. Das Album trägt zwar den Bandnamen GNR, aber es ist der verzweifelte versuch sich so weit wie möglich von GNR ab zu grenzen. Nichts vom Sound ist gebliebn. Sicherlich hätte sich der Sound der Guns auch mit der alten Besetzung verändert, hat er ja von Appetite zu Illusion auch, aber in 100 Jahren wäre nichts wie Chinese Democracy dabei rausgekommen. Das Album hat einen Metaleinschlag, um sich ja vom (klassischen) Rock der Alten Guns zu trennen, als GNR Fan will ich aber genau diesen hören, egal mit welcher Besetzung. Ich weiß nicht ob es an den 25 Jahren Sex, Drugs &amp; Rock N'Roll liegt, aber Axls Stimme ist hier größtenteils nur noch Geschrei.  Das die Band neue besetzt ist und der Sound komplett verändert wurde, der Name aber behalten wurde, hat nur ein Ziel: Cash. Und für das genaue Gegenteil stand GNR immer. Eine Band die mit Geld genau so glücklich war wie ohne, denen es nur um die Musik ging. Hätte man dem Projekt einen neuen Namen gegeben, hätte ich ihnen als neue Metal-Band eine Chance gegeben. Wenn sie aber GNR draufschreiben, bewerte ich auch als GNR Fan. Deshalb nur 2 Sterne denn die Musik ist vielleicht Geschmackssache, aber für jeder, der auch nur ein bisschen GNR möchte ( und zu diesen Leuten zähle ich als echter Fan, der sogar die Slash Bio gelesen hat) wird mit dieser Platte nicht glücklich. Ich hab den Neuen Guns eine offene Chance gegeben , weil ich nicht vergangenen Zeiten hinterher weinen wollte, aber selten wurde ich so enttäuscht."
1,"Schade..ich hätte erwartet das Fady Malouff doch ein paar Überraschungen bietet...da wird wohl ziemlich hochgelobt, für mich ist dieses Album nichts"
5,"es hat meine Erwartungen übertroffen. Ich dachte als ich mir das erste mal What i've Done angehört bzw. angesehn habe ""Ok, es ist was ganz anderes als sonst"" fand es aber schon richtig gut nur hab ich nicht erwartet das, weil es ja nicht so typisch LP ist, so viele Lieder einen ernsten Hintergrund haben wenn man nur auf den Text achtet. Ich habe die CD bis jetzt 3mal durchgehört und noch kein Lied nicht auf Anhieb Super gefunden. Es ist von langsamen und ruhigen Liedern bis zu rockig, lauten Stücken alles vertreten. ach ich liebe diese Cd"
5,"Ich hab die Burschen nach der ""sm""-sache mit dem Orchester schon komplett abgeschrieben gehabt und mir sowieso seit der ""Schwarzen"" nix mehr von denen gekauft. Aber was ist den jetzt los? Die dreschen was das Zeug hält und haben endlich wieder zum Metal zurückgefunden. Und das auf eine subtile Art und Weise wodurch man trotzdem eine Weiterentwicklung sehen kann. Kompliment und Dankeschön ... ich hol schon mal mein altes Metallica T-Shirt aus dem Keller und laufe FRANTIC-Schreiend durch die Straßen."
2,"Irgendwie war es schon 2003 mit ""St. Anger"" klar. Da kommt nichts Neues mehr. Trotz einer Produktion, die sehr rauh und verwaschen ist und einem Rick Rubin, dessen Einfluss als Produzent hier nicht zu hören ist. Über weite Strecken klingt das Album gleichförmig mit seinen typischen Metallica - Zutaten, die da lauten lange Songs, sehr lange Soli, wilde schwere Riffs, die Stimme von James Hetfield und eine Breitseite an Drums. Man könnte das Album auch eine Zusammenfassung ihrer bisherigen Sounds nennen. So kann man zu fast jedem Song das jeweilige Referenzalbum nennen. Wobei dies zwar nicht die schlechteste Voraussetzung ist, aber ""The Day That Never Comes"", ""The Judas Kiss"" oder ""The End Of The Line"" sind einfach nach der Blaupause Metallica entstanden und klingen dadurch sehr formal. Das Album ist allemal besser als ""St. Anger"", doch weit entfernt davon, ein Geniestreich oder ähnliches zu sein."
1,"Also ich bin ein Riesenfan vom ersten Album ""Hybrid Theorie"",denn es waren eigentlich alle Tracks dieses Albums perfekt.Als dann das Remixalbum ""Reanimation"" rauskam war ich auch noch einigermaßen begeistert(besonders die One Step Closer Version mit Jonathan Davis am Mikro hat es mir angetan).Als Meteora rauskam kaufte ich es ohne Probehören am Erscheinungstag und wurde enttäuscht.Den Vogel abgeschossen hatten Linkin Park als sie das Album mit Jay-Z gemacht haben.Denn das hatte meiner Meinung nach nichts mehr mit der Band zu tun die ich gern höre.Als es dann ein bischen still um Linkin Park wurde und ein neues Album angekündigt wird,habe ich gehofft das es wieder so ähnlich oder genauso gut wie ""Hybrid Theorie"" wird.Am Tag an dem ich das erste mal die neue Single ""What i've done"" hörte wurde ich wieder enttäuscht.Da es einfach ein Song ist der meiner Meinung nach dem Radioprogramm angepasst.Genau so wie das Album Minutes to Midnight.Linkin Park ist vorerst für mich gestorben."
1,"einfach nur grauenhaft. Das sind nicht die Rocker Guns and Roses, wie wir sie kennen und lieben. Das  ist eine hinterorts lärmende garagenband, denen man zum ersten Mal Instrumente in die Hände gedrückt hat. Schade, dass ma nicht nulll Punkte vergeben kann."
1,"in Fady M. weiter. Ist es nicht ein Segen? Der 1991 verstorbene Schlagerstar, der 60'er und 70'er Jahre wäre stolz auf Fady. Denn seit dem Ableben des Königs des Schmalzes, hat keiner mehr so Geschmachtet und die Herzen einsamer Frauen so berührt wie nun der gute liebe Fady. ""Gesegnet"" ist er also und einige Fans wollen ihn schon zum Heiligen küren, zum Weltstar erheben und begeben sich schon auf organisierte Pilgerfahrten Richtung Hamburg (inkl. Fady-Figürchen-Verkauf), um dem Nachkommen von Roy Black zu huldigen. ""Blessed"" ist ein recht belangloses Stück, langweiliger und ""sülziger"" Musik, vorgetragen von einem, zugegeben recht sympathisch  wirkenden jungen Mann. Dieses gibt aber leider keinen extra Punkt. Viel Rauch um nichts."
1,"Wißt Ihr was ich gemacht habe, nachdem ich St. Anger 4x durchgehört habe?? - ich hab mir 3x die ""Master of Puppets"" gegönnt, dann ging's wieder einigermaßen!"
1,"Wie schon von einigen anderen Leuten erwähnt: Die CD ist klangtechnisch unter aller Sau. Natürlich müssen Gitarren bei Metallica verzerrt sein, aber muss man deshalb alle Spuren inklusive Schlagzeug in die digitale Sättigung fahren? Wer ist denn so blöd Verzerrung mit Übersteuerung zu verwechseln? Doch sicher niemand, der einige Millionen in die Produktion seiner CD investiert. Aber leider muss man hier feststellen, dass jede Hobby-Band besser produzieren kann als die Ober-Motze von Metallica. Ach ja, die klangtechnisch bessere GuiterHero III Version ist zumindest halbwegs überzeugend. Aber wahrscheinlich werden Metallica wieder alle verklagen, die es wagen eine ordentliche Produktion zu erwarten und so dreist sind sich nach dem Kauf der CD eine andere Version herunter zu laden...$ Ach ja, da war doch was: die Musik. Auch wenn man sich das Album in der Verkaufsversion nicht anhören kann, so kann man doch erkennen: Die Musik ist klasse."
5,"Man hört deutlich das Linkin Park ihren Style geändert haben. Besonders gut sind die Songs Given up, Leave out all the rest, Bleed it Out, What I've Done und No more Sorrow, die anderen Songs sind aber auch alle gut. Nur der letzte Song gefällt mir nicht, da dieser viel zu langsam und ohne Power ist. Letzendlich ist Minutes to Midnight ein sehr gelungenes Album."
1,"jaja, METALLIA haben es geschafft, noch schlechter zu klingen als auf LOAD und RELOAD. Diesmal haben sie die Kochtöpfe ihrer Frauen hergenommen und schlagen munter mit einem Filzpantoffel darauf herum. Mit ""Ride the lightning"" und ""Master of puppets"" ist diese Grütze sowieso nicht zu vergleichen. Ich frage mich langsam, ob das vielleicht eine komplett andere Band war, die damals einen Klassiker nach dem anderen eingespielt hat.... Finger weg von diesem Unsinn!"
1,"Ein Großes Werk kündigten uns Hetfield und Co vor Erscheinen der neuen CD an. Härter sollte sie sein....back to the roots. Nun gut, härter als die Vorgänger ist dieses Machwerk vielleicht, doch das heißt noch lange nicht daß es auch gut ist. Hier wird lieblos auf den Gitarren geschrammelt, die Drums sind furchtbar und der Großteil der Gesangslinien ist einfach nur bescheuert. Wenn man nicht wüßte, daß es sich hier um Metallica handelt ( eine Band die einst Musikgeschichte schrieb), könnte man meinen eine drittklassige Garagen-Band vor sich zu haben. Unter einem anderen Namen hätte dieses billige Gelärme wohl keine nennenswerten Verkaufszahlen erreicht. Man könnte meinem, Metallica verbringen mehr Zeit damit irgendwelche Leute zu verklagen, als an guten Songs zu arbeiten. Für mich ist diese Band endgültig gestorben. R.I.P. Metallica"
5,"Das ist die offizielle Entschuldigung der Band für ""Nothing else Matters"". Lange haben die wahren Fans der Musik von  Metallica auf dieses Album warten müssen. Kraftvoll und hart bringt diese Scheibe die Band wieder an glorreichen Songs wie ""Enter Sandmann"" oder ""Batterie""  heran, ohne auch nur eine Ballade zu verbrauchen. So ist es auch nicht verwunderlich, das dieses Album in mehr als 30 Ländern Top 1 Status erreichte."
2,"Ich war sehr gespannt da die Vorabgerüchte sehr vielversprechend waren. Die Ernüchterung bei den ersten Durchgängen ist deutlich! Die Lieder sind unausgegoren, uninspiriert und wirken irgendwie unfertig. Das ganze klingt als ob das ganze als Demo an einem Wochenende mal eben eingespielt wurde. Der Sound ist einfach primitiv zu nennen. Dazu klingen die ganzen Riffs etc. auch nur einfallslos. Leider ist der Sound auch viel zu NU-METAL orientiert und irgendwie dünn! Bob Rock, hast Du verlernt wie man einen guten Sound auf CD bannt? Dass Du es kannst hast Du doch schon bewiesen! Auch zur Wut und der Agression in der Musik frage ich mich ob ich die falschen Massstäbe anlege, für mich klingt es nach angezogener Handbremse! Vielleicht sind die drei Herren aber auch einfach zu alt für ein fieses derbes wütendes Album. Wie bei Sepultura werde ich Metallica für die Zukunft wohl abschreiben müssen, SCHADE !!"
5,"Avec ""Live At The Regal De B.B. King, le live qui relance le blues. C'est un fait, le blues est une musique conçue pour être jouée en concert, que ce soit dans une petite salle ou à plus grande échelle lors d'un festival. Il n'est pas composé pour passer trois minutes dans une radio qui passe et repasse les mêmes morceaux pendant des décennies, sans se préoccuper du travail qui a été nécessaire pour constituer tout l'album. Ce premier album live du King joué le premier février 1968, au Fillmore Auditorium de Frisco, durée 38'20, publié en novembre chez Stax, suivi heureusement des deux autres ""perles"" en juin, devant un public blanc américain électrisé et conquis ""Permanent member of the Fillmore family a great guitar: this is Mr. Albert King"". Ces trois albums n'ont pas pris une ride. Son arme, le ""Blues Power"", référence aux divers powers de l'époque, le ""Flower Power"" du ""Summer of Love""de 1967 pour n'en citer qu'un, et un artiste jovial au sommet de sa forme en passe de livrer un concert et un moment uniques, surtout venant d'un autodidacte. Un bijoux à suivre. L'album commence par l'instrumental ""Watermelon Man"" de Herbie Hancock, pour chauffer le public, 2' d'intro intense par Lucy, l'étonnante Gibson Flying V , "" I can't hear you, are you ready, put your hands together"" en montrant l'exemple, et conclut en produisant 40 secondes de notes aiguës si reconnaissables. S'ensuit this is ""Blues Power"" compo perso de plus de 10',  ""everybody understands the blues"" et de sa voix chaude il donne des exemples qui expliquent l'essence du blues au public de jeunes non initiés, interrompus par quelques notes bleues ponctuées de cris de joie qui lui appartiennent, puis ""can you feel it?"". Le public répond enthousiaste, cela se sent, peu savent le manier aussi bien. J'ai assisté à nombre de concerts de blues et à la question rituelle ""are you ready for the Blues""? les réponses un peu forcées, voire mollassonnes ne paraissent pas aussi naturelles, jusqu'au moment ou l'artiste réussit à dérider le public. Peut-être l'époque, mais dans tous les cas, certains savent mieux s'y prendre que d'autres pour chauffer une salle, B.B. King, Luther Allison, Lucky Peterson entre autres. Il continue d'apostropher le public, ""you know I get the blues, can you dig the ""Blues Power?, une fois, deux fois, et Lucy ponctue son discours, comme rageuse avec autorité. Le gaucher pince les cordes de sa guitare de droitier avec les doigts en remontant le manche, et en extirpe des notes qui donnent le frisson! Quel son pour l'époque!                                                                                                             Que dire de l'instrumental nerveux ""Night Stomps"", encore une compo perso, exercice de virtuosité qui nous entraîne vers des hauteurs pour mieux nous laisser retomber sur terre dans le suivant, un slow blues de 8'45, ""Blues At Sunrise"", qu'il chantera de façon encore plus intense dans l'excellente session de 1983, à laquelle participe SRV, année de son premier LP, session qui paraîtra en 1999. En 1973, ""Blues At Sunrise"" deviendra le titre d'un album en concert toujours excellent. Plus langoureuse la musique laisse égrener les notes jouissives dont le public perçoit l'émotion et applaudit en rythme.   Dernière compo virevoltante, ""Look Out"" démonstration finale du gaucher magique, qui se permet comme il lui arrivait parfois, quelques effets ""hendrixiens"", soutenu comme l'ensemble de l'œuvre, par l'organiste à la fois discret et toujours présent, James Washington, qui l'aide à construire ses dialogues, conclut une performance magistrale mais trop courte.  1968, avant Woodstock, à peine le début des guitar heroes, et pourtant quel guitariste! Qu'ont pu penser Mayall et Hendrix d'un tel phénomène?"
5,"Le premier extrait de cet album intitulé Chimène donne le ton. C'est le retour de la jeanne mas que l'on aime tant avec sa vois envoutante et des arrangements à la hauteur de son talent. Réalisé avec Piero Calabrese, le complice de ses débuts, cet album aux couleurs de l'été, devrait marquer le retour en force sur le devant de la scène de la star des années 80."
2,"Ce qu'il y a de bien avec les CURE c'est qu'ils ne font rarement les choses à moitié! Bien souvent géniaux, ils ont cependant parfois l'indélicatesse de nous proposer des titres....douteux! Formidable! Le regroupement a eu lieu sur cet album! Au sortir d'un ""Disintegration"" magistral paru un an plus tôt, le band ou plutôt leur major décida de compiler des remixes déjà sortis ou composés pour l'occasion, en prévision des fêtes de fin d'année 90 accompagnés d'un titre inédit. Ah Marketing! Quand tu nous tiens! Attention! Ca n'est pas la liste des titres originels qui est mis en cause mais bien le travestissement opéré. Les versions parfois allongées (extended mix) sont finalement celles qui s'en sortent le mieux ""Lullaby"", ""Lovesong"", ""Hot! Hot! Hot!""... cependant elles n'offrent rien de plus donc.... Quand aux versions ""modifiées"", on passe de l'acceptable ""A forest"" aux horribles ""Close to me"", ""Pictures of you"" et ""In between days"" secondées par une énervante boite à rythmes oscillant entre la techno et le hip-hop! Limite ridicule! Seulement pour les puristes! Euh pardon! les curistes! Et encore!"
5,"Le nouveau opus des deftones est phénoménal.Ce sont des titres soigné melant chanson calme, et chanson bourrin.Si il y aurait 6 étoiles, j'en metterait 6.Ben moi j'ai aimé tous leur albums.Dans l'album deftones on remarque le super titre:minerva."
4,"Red Sparowes est un groupe californien de post rock formé en 2003. Cet album de 2006, après ""At the soundless dawn"" sorti l'année d'avant est excellent: des ambiances torturées qui trainent, entremélées de passages rytmiques et quelques fois ""émo"" assez prenants. L'opus précédent reste sans doute mieux abouti que celui ci cependant, il n'y a pas de doute, c'est quand même un excellent album pour les amateurs de post rock."
5,"Très bon album de Primus avec le sublime ""Southbound Pachyderm"". J'ai mis 5 étoiles au lieu de 4. Mon album préféré reste ""Sailing the Seas of Cheese"" qui est un véritable joyau !"
4,"des reprises qui apportte quelques choses dans l'univers de les, la basse est un peut moins demonstrative que dans primus. Tous les morceaux sont super alors on fait le plein"
1,"Quelle déception ! Je n'ai jamais autant regretté un achat de disque qu'après avoir écouter Hard Candy. Il n'y a ren de valable ou presque dans ce mélange de style, où on ne retrouve pas la grandiose Madone. La chanteuse a perdu sa voix ? Vous savez, celle qui fait vibrer. Quant à faire appel à tant de producteurs, est-ce à dire qu'elle a manqué d'inspiration ? J'aurai tendance à dire que OUI ! Passez votre chemin amateurs de musique ! Hard Candy s'oubliera aussi vite qu'un bonbon fondu au soleil..."
1,"Ben oui, c'est leur plus mauvais album, rien a dire, rien a retenir a part peut etre le morceau qui lui donne le titre et encore........................"
5,"Souvent cité comme étant un des meilleurs album de Slayer je n'avais jamais eu l'occasion d'écouter ce fameux ""Reign in Blood"". Après m'être mis à dos mon amie (c'est juste pour donner une image là...) suite à une écoute  répétée ""headbangant"" bière à la main dans mon salon, il est clair que cet album est une véritable tuerie !!! La galette de 12 titres (dont 1 bonus et 1 remix) avoisine à peine les 35 minutes mais vous balance ses rythmes de batterie galopante, ses riffs incisifs voire stridents et sa basse diabolique en pleine face !!! Pas une seule seconde de répit, les solos de dingues vous pêtent aux oreilles à tout bout de champs et chaque morceaux est d'un rentre dedans impréssionant !!! Un disque vraiment bourrin et qui n'a pas pris une seule ride malgré son âge (bah, quasiment 20 ans tout de même)... Il m'a d'ailleurs donné envie de me pencher plus sérieusement sur la discographie de ce groupe ..."
5,"J'ai 19 ans, ma tante ma donné une cassette de scorpions. J'écoute... Et je tombe sur le cul : Mais c'est trop de la bombde. J'ai cru au départ que c'était un BEST OF tellement chaque chanson est bonne. Entre gros riff, solo du de fou et voix du chanteur qui hypnose... Un album vraiment terrible."
2,"Jusqu'à ""Bloodthirst"", Cannibal Corpse m'a comblé. Depuis ""Gore Obsessed"", j'observe une baisse inexorable de la qualité de leur musique... Cela fait maintenant quelques albums que quasiment la moitié de leurs titres n'ont plus les blasts propres à Cannibal Corpse. Et pour moi, c'est déjà une perte énorme de l'identité du groupe. Deicide n'a pas fait cette erreur, et a même retrouvé une seconde jeunesse avec ""The Stench of Redemption"" (sur l'album suivant, le batteur va encore plus vite, même si l'album est moins intéressant) : Cannibal Corpse devrait se repenser un peu... Si on ajoute à ça que, sur les albums précédant ""Gore Obsessed"", les titres sans blasts possédaient une personnalité propre ainsi que des riffs et rythmes travaillés, ceux de maintenant ne sont plus qu'une suite linéaire de magma de guitares et de batterie qui ne change presque pas de rythme ! Quant à la double pédale, j'aurais aimé plus de passages, ça me manque. Dernière chose : je trouve que la batterie a un vilain son synthétique. Quelques morceaux retiennent tout de même l'attention soit par des rythmes hachés (6 et 12), soit par le couple guitare/batterie un peu original (8)."
5,"Avec ce premier album ""longue durée"", Moonspell propose un black metal teinté de gothique (ou l'inverse) qui traumatisera plus d'un amateur de musique sombre ! Violent et épique, ce CD met surtout en avant une voix unique, beaucoup copiée par la suite, mais jamais égalée : celle de Fernando Ribeiro (alias Langsuyar). Aussi à l'aise dans la litanie gothique (voix ultra grave, d'une profondeur impressionnante) que dans les aboiements sauvages (l'intro du disque!!!), le maître n'est pas pourtant pas encore au top de ses possibilités : accent portugais marqué, effets ""exagérés""... Mais c'est un premier album, et toute l'énergie juvénile qui s'en dégage fait, en grande partie, son charme ! Les compos ne sont pas en reste ! Tous les titres, ou presque, sont des classiques, et on ne s'ennuie pas devant la variété proposée : c'est très heavy (""Wolfshade"", ""Love crimes""), gothique jusqu'à l'extrême (""Vampiria"", marqué par le ""Dracula"" de Coppola, que le chanteur imite à merveille - frissons garantis), quasi hard rock comme un Deep Purple passé en 78 tours (""Midnight ride""), black accrocheur (""Alma mater"", le glorieux classique des concerts du groupe), etc. Quelques interludes nous ramènent au passé ""folk"" du groupe : ""Lua d'inverno"" et ""Tenebraruna"", déclamé en portugais. Mais là où le premier mini-CD, ""Under the Moonspell"", pêchait par une ambition démesurée, hors de portée de musiciens débutants, la musique se fait plus simple... et gagne diablement (facile, mais j'ai pas pu m'en empêcher...) en efficacité. Alors voilà, ce n'est pas parfait, mais je ne crois pas qu'on ait fait mieux dans le style depuis, ou au moins aussi original! Fans de gothique, de black, ou simplement de metal, précipitez-vous sur cet album hors du commun!!!"
4,"A l'origine, encore un titre à la guimauve de Mariah Carey mais c'est son fond de commerce... le remix de Morales qui date un peu est tout simplement bon. Après un passage à vide ou plutôt une période de ""grosse tête aigue"", le voilà qui signe l'un des meilleurs remix de l'année 1999."
1,"Ceux qui veulent écouter du VRAI rock français feraient mieux d'écouter des groupes comme A.S.Dragon ou ceux de l'excellente compilation ""Le nouveau rock français"". La mode des boys band étant passée, la star-ac en vacances, il fallait bien que le jeune public jette son dévolu sur un groupe... Va pour Kyo donc, qui sont certainement une bande de braves gars mais qui manquent sérieusement de classe pour devenir un grand groupe... Au moins auront-ils eu la chance d'être au bon endroit au bon moment et de vendre des camions de disques..."
5,"Loin des dérives commercialistes actuelles, le groupe légendaire de l'ami Phil nous livre ici un album de très haute facture. Chaque plage est empreinte d'une très forte personnalité. ""Take it all too hard"" constitue avec ""Mama"" un des sommets de ce chef-d'oeuvre rock-pop. INDEMODABLE....."
1,je me demande ce que fait ce disque sans le moindre intérêt dans la rubrique musique classique qu'il encombre.
5,"Pareillement à l'autre grande version concurrente Perrahia/Lupu, le duo Zacharias/Hinrichs vient compléter l'excellente intégrale des concertos disponible en coffret chez EMI. Mais ici, la différence est notable : l'orchestration du K365 est la première de Mozart, sans additions    aux vents et sans timbales. Que l'appellation « symphonique » de l'orchestre de Bamberg ne vous fasse pas peur : c'est bien un ensemble chambriste qu'on entend, pour notre plus grand bonheur, fin et discret, laissant chanter tout leur soûl les solistes dont on a du mal à discerner qui joue quoi sans partition. Autrement dire, une version fusionnelle, un tout pianistique évitant le jeu du chacun son tour ! Avec élégance, Zacharias laisse le piano I à sa collègue pour le tenir dans la sonate. Grâce, humour, extrême finesse, notes perlées à la limite de la légèreté, intelligence du texte totalement phase avec l'esprit mozartien. Une sorte d'évidence, très très difficile à obtenir."
2,"Lizz Wright, nouvelle venue, n'est peut-être pas ""le produit"" d'une major, elle sort cependant son cd chez Universal. J'ai voulu me convaincre que ce disque n'était pas si mal, qu'il fallait l'écouter plus. Hélas! Il ne me semble que formaté (ballades folk/pop sur fond jazzy) et sans originalité, pas pire pas mieux que ce que fait Norah Jones. Certes, la voix de L.Wright est belle, d'un beau grave irrésistible. Mais prenez Cassandra Wilson à qui elle m'a fait penser: elle aussi possède cette très belle voix grave...plus des atouts artistiques incomparables. Un disque lisse qui laisse peu d'espoir quant à la création artistique aujourd'hui. Business is business!"
4,"on se demande pourquoi andromeda a été laché par sa distribution française pour ce deuxième album... Il est brillant de bout en bout, fourmillant d'idées rythmiques (batteur phénoménal) de mélodies ciselées et de solos guitare/claviers d'exception. Certes, vous ne trouverez ici ni refrains évidents, ni structures classiques. C'est bien la définition d'une musique progressive qui cherche à enrichir constamment son discours. Un modèle du genre prog metal, en outre très bien produit."
5,"Si vous n'avez jamais compris ce qu'est la Musique aves un grand ""M"",voici le must!!!!!       Ne mourrez pas Idiot...Ecoutez!!!!!"
1,"Album des Stones sans en être vraiment un (Charlie Watts n'y joue pratiquement pas, Jagger et Richards s'évitent), Dirty Work est un album très pauvre dont le seul hit sera une reprise, Harlem Shuffle."
1,"Jagger a dû apprendre ça dans l'école de commerce qu'il fréquentait au début des années 60 avant de devenir chanteur : avant une promotion mondiale, mettre un produit sur le marché. Et donc, avant le « Steel Wheels Tour », sortit le Cd « Steel Wheels ». Qui ressemble à un disque des Stones des années 80, c'est-à-dire des Stones essayant (sans y arriver) de copier les Stones des années 70, qui copiaient les Stones des années 60, qui eux copiaient Chuck Berry et Muddy Waters. Il est inutile de s'étendre sur le fait qu'on est avec « Steel Wheels » très loin d'atteindre les sommets. Ainsi Charlie Watts sonne comme le batteur de Metallica, Bill Wyman va déposer après ce disque les armes dans l'indifférence générale, Wood et Richards riffent et solotent mécaniquement, et Jagger fait semblant d'être concerné pour attirer le chaland. Une question me taraude l'esprit : ceux qui trouvent ce disque pas mal, voire génial, ils en connaissent combien, des disques des Stones ?"
2,"Je ne sais pas pourquoi Steel Wheels fut considéré à sa sortie comme étant l'album de la rennaissance des Stones. Tout est mécanique là dedans. Bon d'accord les glimmer-twins se sont rabibochés, suite à la claque que Jagger à reçu avec sa ""carrière"" solo. Peut être est l'album du soulagement. Les Stones continuent finalement. Ouais ça doit être ça."
2,"Cet album solo de david gilmour le leader des Floyd ne comble pas la longue attente de 12 ans depuis le dernier opus du groupe ""the division bell"" paru en 1994. La voix est toujours aussi belle et ne semble pas vieillir, c'est sympathique dans l'ensemble, mais ça ne décolle pas. A la limite je préfère écouter un autre album solo de gilmour : ""about face"" datant de 1984."
1,"Parfois l'abstinence musicale a du bon. Pourquoi ternir sa gloire passée par un album aussi insipide et naif ? A part Take a breath (un peu) plus dynamique que le reste des titres et ""Smile"" qui rappelle les formidables concerts de la tournée solo 2002 de Gilmour le reste baigne dans une espèce de variété gnan-gnan qui désolent lorsqu'on pense à sa discographie passée frolant la perfection. Certes, David n'a plus rien a prouver (et c'est peut être bien là le problème) mais comment pardonner les tarifs élitistes de ses derniers concerts ! 2x90 euros !!! (pour le premier rang X 2 concerts). Achat dispensable donc (ou alors d'occasion à 6 euros pour le hardcore fan)."
2,"Ce troisième effort de Neal Morse semble marquer le pas. Là où ses anciens collègues de Spock's Beard ont su se renouveler en publiant un album studio magnifique ('Octane') suivi d'un live magistral ('Gluttons for Punishment') et trouver en Nick D'Virgilo un grand chanteur qui est devenu en l'espace de deux albums LA voix de SB, Neal Morse publie ce disque mi-figue mi-raisin avec de bonnes choses comme le morceau-titre ou les morceaux dans lesquels apparaissent Monsieur Steve Hackett et Monsieur Alan Morse mais l'inspiration n'y est plus. Il y a même un plagiat (je n'ai pas trouvé d'autre mot !) d'un morceau de Barclay James Harvest, 'The Song (we love to sing)'  paru sur 'The Eyes of the Universe' en 1978 en plage 4!!! Pour le reste, j'ai l'impression d'entendre à chaque fois 'The Light' mais bien entendu en beaucoup moins réussi. Quant aux paroles, je rejoins ce qui a été dit, à savoir que ça commence à devenir pénible ces histoires de religion. On s'ennuie ferme, plus de choses amusantes, de folie verbale ! Voire de folie tout court ! Heureusement, il reste Spock's Beard qui est beaucoup plus plaisant que ne l'est devenu ce brave Neal."
5,"Voila un merveilleux artiste ! Si vous aimez Dylan, Springsteen, Bob Seger et autres Tom Petty, ruez-vous sur la discographie d'Elliott Murphy. Il aurait mérité une auguste carrière. Lost Generation et Night Lights sont respectivement le deuxième (1975) et le troisième (1976) album de l'auteur. Parmi ses compositions raffinées on retiendra les magnifiques ""History"", ""Eva Braun"" et surtout ""Vision Of The Night"" sur Lost Generation, ""Diamonds By The Yard"", ""Isadora's Dancers"" et le sublime ""You Never Know What You're In For"" sur Night Lights, l'un des purs chef-d'œuvres du folk-rock. Un disque à posséder absolument. Un artiste plein d'humour à voir en concert."
5,"Sleeping Gypsy produit par Tommy Lipuma (Le maître)est certainement un des disques les plus importants pour Michael Franks. Intéressé par la musique brésilienne, MF avait sorti à l'époque un enregistrement Jazz/Pop très réussi, cool à souhait, bien travaillé avec d'excellents musiciens (Michael Brecker, Larry Carlton ,Joe Sample, David Sanborn et Wilton Felder). Ce disque référence en la matière n'a pas pris une ride."
1,"Ce Cd commence par ""We don't need this fascit groove thang"", titre militant écrit contre la montée des extrémistes de droite dans le monde, symbolisée selon le groupe par l'élection en 1980 de Ronald Reagan aux USA. Ce titre, le meilleur de l'album, sera plus ou moins censuré par la maison de disques du groupe. Du groupe ? Plutôt un collectif formé par deux « dissidents » de Human League fin 1980, également au centre de la nébuleuse British Electric Foundation, collectif de musique électronique destiné à conquérir les hit-parades mondiaux. Bon, l'objectif n'a pas été atteint, à cause d'une musique aujourd'hui très typée mais qui même à l'époque n'avait guère convaincu. Uniquement à base de synthés, truffée d'effets faciles et simplistes, trop prévisibles. Heaven 17 eut paraît-il une certaine influence sur Soft Cell et Depeche Mode à leurs débuts. Le groupe rencontrera de petits succès en invitant, pour quelques singles des chanteuses alors au creux de la vague (Chakha Khan, Tina Turner avant son come-back de 1984)."
5,"Ca faisait un moment que j'avais arrêté à écouter du heavy car je trouvais que la flamme s'était éteinte à la fin des années 80 et après...miracle!!!  Une petite merveille cet album,que j'ai découvert tout à fait par hasard, et qu'il faut écouter absolument. Apparemment, il n'a rien à voir avec le premier opus, très hard core ce dernier, de ce groupe étonnant à souhait. Les mélodies s'enchaînent les unes après les autres dans un seul et même morceau, à un point qu'on s'y perd au début. Mais petit à petit, on s'y habitue et après, ce n'est que du plaisir. Magnifiques musiciens, à mi-chemin entre Iron Maiden et Dream Theater, le tout,couronné par la voix sublime et certes, très agrèable du chanteur. Au bout de la troisème écoute, on commence à fredonner tout seul à la longeur de la journée car, fait rarissime de nos jours, l'album fait parti de ceux que plus on écoute, plus on aime."
4,"Très efficace, et surtout très technique, les americains de Lamb Of God signe avec ""Sacrament"" un album riche qui oscille entre stoner metal et metalcore. Les chants essentiellement hurlés sont absolument halluciants. Si je n'aurais qu'une chose à reprocher à ce ""Sacrament"", c'est son côté trop linaire. On aurait davantage espérer un côté un peu plus expérimental. Un album qui prend toute sa dimension en live. Ayant fait le ""Unholy Alliance"" à Bercy, je peux vous assurer que c'est la claque !"
5,"Après un album plutôt décevant (Brand New Day), Sting remet les choses à plat et synthétise en dix chansons l’harmonie parfaite entre sonorités électroniques, guitares électriques et ambiance jazzy. Sting aborde avec toujours autant de facilité les différents styles musicaux qui composent depuis ses débuts sa musique (le jazz, la World Musique, le rock, la pop), mais il semble que pour la première fois le mélange se fait avec encore plus de précision, avec encore plus d’harmonie que par le passé. Une véritable renaissance pour cet artiste polymorphe qui compose un album vibrant et vivant, ampli de maturité et de jeunesse. Un album qui tutoie ses meilleures compositions depuis The Soul Cages et Ten Summoner’s Tales. A 52 ans Sting s’offre une cure de jeunesse sans se renier. La classe mon fils !"
2,"Pour moi, le groupe est mort depuis le départ de David Lee Roth ! L'arrivée de Sammy Haggar transforme le groupe en Hard F.M avec des titres comme ""LOve Comes Walking In"" , ""5150"" , ""Summer Night"" ou encore ""Dreams"" ! Rien à gardé !"
4,"Le morceau ""Tommy the Cat"" (live) justifierait a lui tout seul l'achat de ce disque : une rythmique imposante et ecrasant tout sur son passage, avec un solo de basse incroyable (""The Awakening"" des ""Reddings"") suivit d'un solo de batterie tout aussi impressionnant. Cet album constitue le 2ieme opus de reprises du groupe (qui se reprend lui meme) avec des morceaux de Metallica, Police (dont le batteur forme avec le bassiste de Primus le groupe Oysterhead) ou Peter Gabriel. Explosif !"
4,"j' ai découvert ce groupe par hasard. C 'est particulièrement mélodique. ça me fait penser à un dimmu borgir avec son enthrone darkness triumphant mais en plus doux et avec des vocalises féminins. les titres euphoria, lithium and a lover et voices sont des titres particulièrement attirants pour des oreilles non initiées au metal symphonique avant de pouvoir passer plus tard à plus hard ! C' est une bonne drogue douce. Je met 4 étoiles car l' excellence n' existe pas !"
5,"Si j'avais écrit « un peu trop best of », cela pour autant n'aurait pas été un reproche. Tom Petty sans les Heartbreakers ( Howie Epstein puis de nouveau Ron Blair et Stan Lynch puis Steve Ferrone ) mais avec ses deux collaborateurs principaux Mike Campbell et Jeff Lynne. Sacré trio et quel savoir-faire !. Il n'y a pas la créativité des trois albums de ""Full moon fever"" à ""Wild flowers"" mais T.P. fait du Tom Petty et ses admirateurs vont d'autant moins sans plaindre que l'impression est celle de l'achèvement et non pas de la répétition. Saving grâce pour commencer et de même ""down south"" sont sur les excellents DVDs ""running down a dream"", deux titres, inclus le dernier avec cette rythmique genre ""Harvest"" de Neil Young ou bien ici une Rickenbaker qui éclabousse et magnifie (""Flirting with time"") ou là un phrasé à la Dylan ou encore quelques notes de vibraphone et pour peu une ballade genre Pink Floyd. En ce qui me concerne j'ai ""besoin"" de réduire un peu le volume de la ""hi-fi"", le son est resplendissant, fort et clair. Quasiment une dizaine de CDS sans compter les dvds de ""l'homme de Gaineville"" et je ne peux qu'attendre la suite. La Nasa ou Esa devraient songer à joindre un cd ou dvd de Tom Petty, cela peut intéresser la galaxie."
1,"Bon, si vous avez aimé et trouvé fabuleux le titre ""Loch Ness"" du précédent album de Judas Priest, Angel of Retribution, alors vous allez adorer Nostradamus. Si comme moi, vous avez trouvé ce même titre comme étant un des plus nuls de Judas Priest, et bien, oubliez très vite Nostradamus, parce que ce sont deux cds dans la même veine. Ce n'est plus du Judas Priest. C'est affligeant, voire grotesque et en plus Priest a le culot de nous présenter cet album comme leur nouveau chef d'oeuvre (dixit leur site internet). Chef d'oeuvre pour eux, peut-être (on est jamais mieux servi que par soi-même) mais c'est vraiment prendre les fans pour des pigeons. Album à oublier."
5,dans la famille inclassable;je voudrais le Père... Il est encore possible d éprouver des émotions fortes en écoutant de la musique:la preuve! Un disque insensé(c est un compliment)
4,"Hanin Elias, la ""belle"" gueuleuse germano-iranienne nous livre son troisième album solo. Pas de très grosse surprise : celui-ci continue dans l voie électro-rock esquissé dans le bruyant ""In Flames"" (paru chez DHR le label d'Empire) et brillamment assumé sur ""No Games No Fun"" (premier skeud Fatal, le label féministe d'Hanin herself). Cependant, là, au lieu de collaborer à tour de bras avec des pointures de l'underground électro, elle s'entiche de Tweakerray et livre un album fatalement (sic) plus monotone que son dernier chef d'oeuvre. on sait tout de suite que les pistes sont issues de la même session d'enregistrement qui a eu lieu au même studio et en présence des mêmes personnes. Reste qu'elle s'en sort bien ; le songwriting est un peu bâclé mais la tigresse est en forme vocalement au point de se risquer à chanter seulement accompagné d'un piano (""Untouchable (Unplugged)""), de textures douçâtres(""After All""). On a droit à deux morceaux de digital hardcore (""Fight Together"", ""War""), le reste est assez dansant et ferait une super ambiance pour un bar alternatif mêlant punk et électro. Digne d'intérêt mais pas d'un enthousiasme démesuré."
2,"Dans le monde impitoyable des trios puissants de l'époque, les membres de Dust sont volontiers considérés parmi les premiers américains à s'aventurer sur les territoires du rock progressif anglais. Ce premier album demeure pourtant à un stade antérieur, celui d'un hard rock américain qui peine à s'extraire du blues-rock et du psychédélisme californien. Ce conservatisme frileux, que l'on peut comparer ici à celui d'un groupe comme Cactus, souffre beaucoup de la comparaison avec les efforts contemporains des anglais. Alors que le rock lourd britannique, qu'il soit pataud ou sophistiqué, transcende déjà les formats boogie, blues ou anarchiques de la fin des années soixante, Dust reste obsédé par l'œuvre de Cream ainsi que par celle des Who. Ces deux vénérables formations sont ici bien imitées, avec un alourdissement massif, une énergie admirable, et quelques suppléments typiquement américains comme les guitares glissées et autres boogies routiers. Dust apparait ainsi sur ce premier album comme un groupe sérieux, plutôt sympathique, parfois entrainant mais jamais réellement mémorable.  Le bassiste Kenny Aaronson, également guitariste, brille pourtant par sa technique impressionnante et ses interventions particulièrement judicieuses. Le trio semble en accord avec son temps sur ce qui reste sa seule et unique composition, le très véloce ""Loose Goose"". Le reste du disque est composé par la paire Richie Wise Marc Bell, respectivement guitariste/chanteur et batteur, et sonne à la manière du hard rock balbutiant de la fin des années soixante. Dust y privilégie la puissance vocale, façon Who, et les rampes de lancement pour soli, façon Cream, au détriment des riffs, trop rudimentaires pour se révéler attrayants. Les ballades bluesy appuyées succèdent à des parades instrumentales fort bien exécutées, mais primitives et rébarbatives. ""From a Dry Camel"" constitue ainsi le véritable paroxysme de ce rock périmé, basé sur une mélodie grossière, répétée inlassablement par l'intermédiaire des riffs et du chant, et sur laquelle se greffent d'interminables soli pour une durée totale typiquement psychédélique approchant les dix minutes. Source d'un plaisir simple et fugace, ce premier effort aussi inoffensif que banal et démodé ne privera pas Dust d'une seconde chance. Son illustration inquiétante, tirée des catacombes, ne donne quant à elle que de faux espoirs quant à une audacieuse noirceur."
1,"Mis à part Clones ( repris depuis par les Smashing Pumpkins) et Pain , un album aussi horrible que sa pochette. Alice ne se rapelle même pas l'avoir enregistré et on est vraiment a des années lumières de Killer.  Precurseur , Alice livrera cet album pathétique , bien avant les années 80 où Bowie , les Stones ou Mac Cartney enricheront à leurs tours le musée des horreurs discographiques"
5,"Pour toute une génération de p'tits graisseux (salut ZEGUT !), cet album représente une révolution, au meme titre que PARANOID, SCHOOL'S OUT ou BLACK NIGHT. Moins prestigieux que ces alter ego de l'époque, URIAH HEEP et son chanteur charismatique, david BYRON, n'en restent pas moin un groupe innovant par ces mélodies à plusieurs voix, bien avant QUEEN. Mélodies, qui, sur cette galette, sont toutes plus entrainantes les unes que les autres, comme ""THE WIZARD"" dont l'intro a la gratte sèche est d'une pureté sans égal. HENSLEY, l'organiste était un compositeur prolifique, ce qui explique qu'en 5 ans, le groupe a sorti 10 albums ! Impensable aujourd'hui. Disparus, THAIN, le bassiste jazzy et BYRON, le chanteur à la voix d'or, nous font regretter cette époque bénie du ""PEACE AND LOVE"", ""SEX, DRUG AND R'N'ROLL"" où les avions ne s'abbattaient pas encore sur des tours... DEMONS AND WIZARDS, un titre prémonitoire finalement, non ?"
4,"Le vintage n'a jamais aussi bien fonctionné qu'en ce nouveau millénaire. Si de nombreux vétérans du rock demeurent dans une perpétuelle et vaine quête d'innovation, d'autres, comme Uriah Heep semblent désormais résolus à un abord plus nostalgique. La formation n'est pourtant plus celle qui sévissait de façon grotesque et attachante dans les années soixante-dix. Depuis la défection récente du batteur Lee Kerslake pour raisons de santé, le vénérable guitariste Mick Box est l'unique vestige d'une gloire vieille de plus de trois décennies, et la seule légitimité à conserver le précieux nom d'Uriah Heep. Le reste de la formation est pourtant soudé à lui depuis la fin des années quatre-vingt et Raging Silence (1989), mais ne goutera jamais à cette étrange ferveur faite d'acclamations du public et de dénigrements systématiques de la critique. Le substitut actuel du vieux Ken Hensley se nomme Phil Lanzon, un claviériste qui, comme son illustre ancêtre, s'impose également comme l'un des compositeurs principaux de sa formation. Le chanteur Bernie Shaw ne ressuscite malheureusement pas le malheureux alcoolique David Byron. Il s'en rapproche évidemment dans ses prestations vocales, allant même jusqu'à prendre les grands airs de Bruce Dickinson, puis d'autres, plus regrettables, plus populistes, ceux d'un autre Bruce... Springsteen.  Wake the Sleeper est un succès dans le sens où il donne immédiatement et durablement l'impression d'avoir été conçu trente ans plus tôt. Les principales signatures du grand Uriah Heep sont parfaitement retranscrites, non sans un certain talent au niveau de l'écriture. Les compositions, signées Box et Lanzon pour la plupart, font évidemment la part belle à ce hard rock d'épouvante, invitant l'ensemble du groupe à participer aux harmonies vocales de ""manoir hanté"". La dimension théâtrale est propulsée avec ce coté lourdaud qui faisait le charme du groupe et suscitait le mépris de la critique, cette démarche burlesque qui empêchera encore les rockologues les plus snobs de reconnaitre le caractère éminemment accrocheur d'un ""Tears of the World"" ou d'un ""Angel Walk with You"". Malgré les années passées, le groupe résiste toujours fièrement à la peur du ridicule, se risquant à un hommage dramatique et pompeux aux indiens d'Amérique. Aussi grotesque que poignant, ce ""What Kind of God"" inspiré par le massacre de Wounded Knee est une réussite grandiose. Le Religionnaire n'oubliera pas de mentionner la tournure plus anecdotique de certains titres au sein desquels le groupe dévoile un hard rock plus générique, qui, bien que moins attrayant n'incite toujours pas l'auditeur à zapper.  Uriah Heep, du moins ce qu'il en reste, se rend un très bel hommage avec ce Wake the Sleeper cocasse et savoureux, à écouter de préférence avec une moustache et des cheveux longs."
5,"Ecoutez ALIVE, et vous vous rendrez compte du monument devant lequel vous vous trouvez. Aucun autre enregistrement en public ne fait cet effet. Tout est la, un public présent mais pas trop, des compos super boostés par rapport à leur version originales, des musiciens au sommet de leur art, pas de bla-bla inutile, de la bonne musique, et c'est bien ce qui est demandé à un album enregistré en public, ce que la plupart des artistes ont maintenant oublié. C'est album est idéal pour découvrir ce groupe trop méconnu, voire dénigré, en france. En l'écoutant, vous vous apercevrez de façon indéniable de l'influence qu'a eu KISS dans le hard rock, car ne l'oublions pas, cet album date de 1975....."
5,"Connu aussi sous le nom de Metal Box (UK), Second Edition est sans contredit le meilleur album de Public Image Ltd. Les morceaux sont mélodiques et la section rythmique particulièrement inventive. Tout surprend dans cet album qui ne ressemble à aucun autre et dont l'ambiance est à la fois rock et feutrée. Il est malheureux que Public Image Ltd soit un groupe si peu connu de nos jours. Ils ont pourtant su produire leurs classiques."
5,"Un disque qui mérite amplement d'être (re)découvert. A l'aube des 80's, Simple Minds ne jouait pas encore sur le même terrain que U2: leurs premiers enregistrement évoquent beaucoup Bowie et Roxy Music, mais également Kraftwerk sur ce deuxième LP (écoutez le titre 'Real to Real', qui ouvre l'album!) qui laisse une grande part à l'expérimentation et aux bidouillages ('Naked Eye', 'Cacophony', 'Veldt'...) Le tout rappelle fortement le Magazine de 'Real Life' (la production de John Leckie, commune aux 2 groupes, n'y est pas étrangère). Parmi les titres forts, citons 'Carnival', 'Citizen', 'Factory', 'Calling Your Name'; les écossais y déploient un style où un certain romantisme noir cotoit des rythmes dansants, des guitares tendues et la voix incantatoire de Jim Kerr. Avec l'album suivant ('Empires &amp; Dance), Simple Minds poursuivrait dans cette veine en accentuant le côté synthétique."
5,"un disque incontournable dans la discographie du grand Gil.Plusieurs titres inoubliables comme ""your daddy loves you"" ou encore ""song for bobby smith"".Un album envoutant à posséder à tout prix. Je le recommande aussi pour les débutants qui voudraient apprendre à connaitre cet artiste situé entre soul, jazz et rap. A posséder, et vite...."
4,"4 superbes morceaux d'I Jah Man, accompagné de la crème des musiciens jamaicains: les Wailers Earl 'Chinna' Smith et Earl 'Wire' Lindo, Sly &amp; Robbie, mais aussi les Sons of Negus... Jah Heavy Load et Jah Is No Secret sont les meilleurs de l'album. Aussi bon que Are We A Warrior, son second album."
5,"Dennis Brown fut un chanteur prolifique, cet album n' est pas très connu mais est probablement son ou un de ses meilleurs avec ""Joseph's coat of many colours"" et ""Wolf and Leopards"". Les chansons sont troublantes tellement l' émotion y est grande et authentique. Cet album fut enregistré chez Joe Gibbs, dont les talents de producteur ne sont plus à prouver. Tous les titres sont exceptionnels sauf peut-être ""Love me Always"", un peu trop lover dans le style. Certains sortent du lot en devenant des INDISPENSABLES. ""Oh Mother, Concrete Castle King, Malcolm X, Milk and Honey... Un album mystique ou le terme roots prend l' essence de sa signification. Un album indispensable !"
5,"Ce coffret contient 4 CDs, incluants ""a priori"" tous les enregistrements studio et des engeristrements ""live"". La présentation est soignée, digipack cartonné format long rappelant un peu les albums 33 tours avec un booklet retraçant l'histoire du groupe. Excellents morceaux pour les amateurs de cette période des ""late sixties""."
5,"Shannon Wright c'est une voix écorchée, qui tantôt n'hésite pas à crier, et d'autres fois susurre. Une voix un peu cassée. Pour des chansons aux themes sombres."
5,"Que de frissons on peut avoir en écoutant des morceau de guitares, quelle soient de l'ordre sentimentale ou expressive. Dans la musique l'instrument de la guitare est le plus populaire et le plus connu. Cet instrument est le plus vendu au monde."
1,"Déçu....pronfondement déçu. Cinq ans d'attente, pour un album qui est, comme il avais été annoncé, plus brutal, mais ou est passé la patte Metllica ? Les morceaux resemblent plus (tout en restant en plus bien inferieur) à du limb bizkit, sum41, slipknot que metallica..  Les compositions sont ""vides"", les morceaux se repètent, on a l'impression de tourner en rond, et on se surprend a attendre la fin du morceau... La produtioc, confié a bob rock, est elle aussi plus que douteuse, a ecouter le mixage et le son, on a peine a croire qu'il a fallu près de deux ans pour que cet album soit composé et enregistré.. Le son de la batterie est nul, a croire que lars a joué sur un batterie de cuisine, les guitares sonnent mal, les rifs sont pauvres... bref... amis chevelus, ecoutez bien ce CD avant de depenser votre argent bêtement."
2,"Quel plaisir peut on éprouver quand on entend des cochons enragés qui crient dans un micro ou d'autres qui semblent vomir.... Si vous voulez un vrai groupe noir, écoutez Joy Division, les stooges ou le velvet underground mais par pitié faites taire les enragés...."
5,"Dave Lombardo quitte Slayer et pour s'occuper fonde Grip Inc... Pour s'occuper ?!! Mais il aurait du le faire avant ! Véritable bombe atomique aux relents hispanisants, ""Power of Inner Strength"" n'est pas qu'un coup d'essai, c'est un coup de maître concocté par 4 grands pros du métal contemporain. Caractérisé par une rythmique évidemment apocalyptique du sieur Lombardo, une maîtrise époustouflante de la guitare de Waldemar Sorychta et des vocaux impériaux de Gus Chambers, ce disque force le respect par son niveau d'inspiration et l'originalité de sa musique, qui redéfinit un pan entier du trash moderne. Doté d'un gros son en forme de bulldozer, ""Power of Inner Strength"" transpire l'énergie pure, tout en insufflant une touche flamenco du plus bel effet au coeur ou en intro de compos ravageuses. L'intro en rythmiques sèches suivie de ""Savage Seas (Retribution)"" forme une entrée en matière monumentale, qui non contente de vous atomiser les neurones, ouvre la route à 9 autres titres plus démentiels les uns que les autres. En fer de lance on retiendra les immenses ""Hostage To Heaven"", ""Guilty Of Innocence"", ""Heretic War Chant"" et le lourdissime ""Ostracized"" en mid-tempo forgé dans l'acier trempé. Attention, même si cet album brille par une certaine brutalité, il propose un trash technique très mélodieux qui éclabousse de sa classe tous ses voisins et qui se positionne non pas comme un ersatz de Slayer, mais comme un concurrent menaçant. Vous êtes prévenus, ça déménage..."
1,"Cela me fait de la peine de le dire, mais le génie de Kate Bush est cruellement absent de cet album. Les mélodies sont plates et sa voix est noyée dans des arrangements conventionnels. On ressent un manque d'énergie du début à la fin. C'est bien dommage."
2,"Radiohead se la joue avant-garde... Pourquoi pas ?  L'embêtant c'est que ""Kid A"" est plus ennuyeux que passionnant, plus prétentieux que réellement innovant... On a la triste impression d'écouter une musique informe - à la limite, parfois, du supportable. Où est passé le Thom Yorke de ""Street Spirit"", ""Exit Music"" ou ""Karma Police"" ? Radiohead est le plus grand groupe actuel ?... Oui, pour faire prendre à ses fans des vessies pour des lanternes !!"
1,"C'était le CD le plus attendu de l'année pour moi.Ce l'était.Si on ressentait ce frisson mélancolique à l'écoute de OK Computer,ici on ne ressent plus rien.Radiohead est sur son nuage et on ne l'entend plus (aux deux sens du terme).Dommage!On peut faire une musique expérimentale sans être rébarbatif (cf.Naked City),mais Radiohead semble se complaire dans une attitude certainement plus paresseuse et misanthrope qu'""anti-commerciale""."
1,"Une première écoute presque agréable .... mais, c'est plat et mou dans l'interprétation, dommage car Pink Floyd est une source incroyable d'imagination ... là, rien. Je regrette.C'est sans doute une bonne écoute pour les personnes qui ne connaissent pas ce groupe."
5,"Comme un taureau qui emporte tout sur son passage, The Band  et notre Robert favori nous pondaient en cette année 1974 un live dantesque .Pour une fois je vais vous la jouer simple,pas besoin de raconter la vie et l'aeuvre du Zimm,69 ans et une quarantaine d'albums à ce jour,d'autres l'ont fait avec talent comme Thaly    . Il est à mes yeux le plus grand auteur compositeur du 20eme siècle, c'est mon avis et il est incontestable et définitif, même  si certains me diront oui mais   , et  , et   (jeu: cherchez l'erreur).  Formidable double live donc avec un Rob en grande forme accompagné du Band (R Robertson ;Garth Hudson ;Levon Helm ;Richard Manuel ;Rick Danko) et une set list d'enfer ,( knockin on heaven's door ; it ain't me babe ;ballad of a thin man  ;dont'think twice ;just like a woman ;watchtower ;like a rolling stone ;blowin in the wind;highway61 revisited.. ) plus quelques titres phares du Band (cripple creek,stage fright,the weight,night they drove old dixie Dixon..la plupart trouvables sur  ). Grande intensité dans ce live et des versions souvent supérieures aux versions studios. A noter que tous les membres du Band chantent leur morceau et un début de disque 2  superbe avec des versions acoustiques à tomber par terre de don't think twice;just like a woman et it's allright ma. Le Band, certainement le plus formidable backing band de l'histoire, digne du talent de Robbie . Il n'y a pas d'age pour découvrir Dylan et je ne peux qu'encourager mes plus jeunes lecteurs endemolisés qui croient que   est un artiste à se mettre entre les oreilles un skeud du grand Bob (1metre 67). cd1  11 titres 45 :53 cd2   10titres  46 :51 (com dédicacée à « Soul sister » qui m'a parlé de cet album)"
2,"""New York avec toi"" sert d'illustration au film à succès ""Marche à l'ombre"". Ecoutez-donc Renaud et vous découvrirez l'humeur des banlieues françaises. Pour le reste, je rêvais d'un autre ""Téléphone"". Je crache mon venin au coeur de la nuit qui, c'est bien connu, n'en a pas..."
2,"Après deux magnifiques albums, ""Spend the Night"" et ""Gold Medal"", c'est avec impatience que j'attendais cet album. Le titre ""Don't wait up for me"" annonçait la couleur - typiquement dans le style ""The Donnas"" des deux derniers albums - et c'était de bonne augure pour la suite. Et bien la suite n'est pas à la hauteur, sauf pour l'autre titre ""Save me"", également estampillé ""The Donnas"". Le reste, c'est du rock classique, pas déplaisant à l'écoute mais assez banal dans l'ensemble, simpliste et un air de déjà vu (ou entendu). Peut-être un album plus fait pour la scène? Alors, mauvais disque ou mes attentes étaient trop importantes par rapport aux deux derniers albums pondus par ces demoiselles? Aucune idée. Je constate que le même scénario s'est produit avec Alice Cooper: deux magnifiques albums (""Brutal Planet"" et ""Dragontown"") et après, plongeon dans l'anonymat d'un rock banal et sans relief. Cela s'écoute mais avec cette déséagrable sensation qu'il manque quelque chose, que ce n'est plus comme avant. Dommage."
2,"Disque fait à la va vite et le problème c'est que ça s'entend ! Les compos sont très moyennes, le son est crade et le tout très sombre voir glauque. Cela frémit sur quelques morceaux mais ça ne décolle jamais. Très inférieur à Nevermind"
5,"Ecrasé par le succès planétaire (et involontaire, il faut bien l'avouer) de ""Nevermind"", Kurt Cobain, aux épaules trop frêles pour porter pareil fardeau, nous offrit avec ""In Utero"" l'album le plus viscéral qui soit. Un son brut, qui pourrait paraître brouillon aux oreilles des profanes, des guitares saturées, une rythmique moins assagie que dans leur précédent opus : tout était réuni pour rendre cet album moins ""facile"" d'accès que le précédent, moins grand public en tout cas. Et pourtant, la touche Nirvana est toujours là, intacte, même après plus de dix ans. On trouve sur ""In Utero"" cette même rage, cette même poésie que dans tous les disques de ce groupe maintenant mythique. Ecorché vif, Cobain, soutenu par ses deux fidèles complices, atteint l'état de grâce dans cet album, au prix qu'on connait désormais. Indispensable, tout simplement."
5,"Ce  CD ""compile""  les  2  albums  de  ces  Ducs  de  la  Stratosphère, qui  ne  sont  autres  que  les  membres  de  XTC...Très  influencés  par  le  rock  psyché  de  la  fin  des  60's, il  était  presque  obligé  qu 'ils  en  donnent  leur  interprétation un  jour . Et  ça  donne  ces  chansons  complètement  délirantes ( mais  chansons  quand  mème!) ,entre  respect  et  irrévérence . Pour  un  prix  dérisoire, vous  pouvez  vous  offrir  un  passionnant  survol  de  cette   vague  psychédélique ,  avec  des  morceaux  originaux.   Les  clins  d'  oeil  sont  innombrables ( Beatles  of  course, Byrds  de  ""Fifth  Dimension"", Yardbirds , Pink  Floyd  époque  Syd Barrett,Electric Prunes , Beach  Boys etc....) . Mais  ce  n'  est  aucunement  du  plagiat ; car  les  Dukes  nous  revisitent  ça  avec  tellement  de  classe  et  d' auto-dérision  que  ça  en  devient  énorme . De  toute  façon,  leur  but  initial  était  de  s'  amuser . Mais  comme  ils  sont  d ' excellents  musiciens ,cette  parenthèse  récréative  donne  au  final seize  pastiches , qui  eux-mèmes  sonnent  comme  des  standards. Quelques  exemples : - ""25 o'clock"" : réveil  en  ""cloches"", orgue  farfisa et  mélodie   réminiscente  de  "" I  had  too  much  to  dream  last  night""  des  Electric  Prunes... Très  impressionnant. - ""My  love  explodes"": ressemble  à  un  inédit  imaginaire  des  Yardbirds , avec  guitare  qui  couine , ça  fait  très  mal. - ""Mole  from  the  Ministry "": chainon  manquant  entre ""I  am  the  Walrus"" et  "" Sowing  the  seeds  of  love""  de  Tears  For  Fears ( avec  4  ans  d'  avance ! )  et  cri  à  la  "" A day  in  the  life "" ... -'Collideascope "":  génial  pastiche  de  Lennon ... -""Brainiac ' s  daughter "" : ce  coup-ci  c 'est  au  tour  de  Macca  ; ambiance  ""Yellow  Submarine""  avec  solo  de  pipeau   et  bruits  aquatiques   divers... Very  funny ! - ""Pale  &amp;  precious "" : admirable  remake  de  ""Good  vibrations "" . Il  faudrait  toutes  les  citer ; bref , pas  une  seconde  d'  ennui ."
5,"""Don't step outside"" me dit-on. Suis-je déjà endormi ? Quelqu'un chuchotte dans mon oreille...Des guitares sont à côté de moi, une basse au son clair et léger comme sur un premier Built to Spill se fond à l'Harmonie Générale...  Et cette voix. La proximitè du groupe dans ce disque est croissante : fermer les yeux et vous les croirez entrain de jouer au pied de votre lit... La tension monte et une lourde atmosphère comme parfumée d'encens s'installe.Une rage est contenue mais déborde par endroit. Le plus grand moment de l'album est sans aucun doute le sublime morceaux ""Washer"" et sa montée progressive vers une explosion distordue d'une puissance inouïe. Avec en prime une très jolie photo de Will Oldham (alias Palace Brothers, Bonnie Prince Billy...), ce disque est un de ceux dont vos enfants vous parleront comme d'un disque culte."
1,"Mon Dieu, quelle déception. Fan de la première heure j'ai beaucoup de mal à reconnaitre dans cet album le groupe au son plein de cuivres qui swinguent, aux textes tout droit sortis de polars plein de barbouzes et de premiers flingues que j'allais voir dans les petites salles des Pays de La Loire. C'est mou, formaté, ça swing pas, les cuivres ne claquent pas, Pierrot chante maintenant distinctement mais ses textes ont perdu leur côté ""Audiard"", la batterie est très énervante, les riffs semblent entendus 1000 fois sur n'importe quel album de SK8core de supermarché. Deuxième effet ""major"" ou bien la flamme s'éteint? L'album précédent m'avait fait le même effet, la tournée m'avait un peu rassuré. J'espère qu'il en sera de même pour celle-ci."
5,"Ce DVD remémorisee bien le souvenir d'un excellent concert à Lyon ce même mois d'octobre 2008. Ici, c'es en Pologne, avec un public plutôt sage et bien assis : ce n'était pas le cas en France, mais nous on a eu la chance de la ""descente"" du maestro vers son public lors de ""it's only me"".... le frisson assuré bien sür!!! C'est le témoignage de 30 ans de carrière d'un groupe avec des hauts et des bas qui, contemporains de Marillion, n'ont pas eu la chance d'une notoriété immédiate à défaut de n'avoir sorti le disque d'anthologie dans les années 80 (script for a jester's tears pour Marillion) et peut- être de n'avoir pas eu un chanteur du charisme de Fish. Le groupe est éminemment sympathique sur scène et ce d'autant plus avec le nouveau batteur assez extraverti, Scott Higham, mais parfois aussi un peu lourd dans son jeu (Breaking the spell).  On ne peut qu'admirer sans réserves la performance et l'immense talent de compositeur, chanteur, guitariste, âme de Pendragon, Nick Barrett. Une voix unique et un jeu de guitare tout aussi unique, sans esbrouffe, et toujours terriblement poignant : il y a ici foison de solos et la caméra capte bien le doigté de l'artiste. La prise de son est excellente. Avec Pure le groupe a acquis une certaine reconnaissance de la presse prog, au bout de 30 ans quand mëme,et a aussi sûrement élargi voire rajeunit son public avec une touche plus métal. Un choix qui peut-être discutable mais qui leur a réussi."
4,"Pascal Dusapin est né le 29 mai 1955 à Nancy. Après des études d'arts plastiques et de sciences, il étudie l'orgue et le piano, mais sans imaginer embrasser la carrière de musicien. Il étudie malgré cela la composition, en autodidacte. Il reçoit le soutien et les encouragements d'André Boucourechliev, séduit par sa première partition orchestrale. De 1974 à 1978, il fréquente quantités de séminaires organisés par Iannis Xenakis, compositeur qu'il considère comme son seul véritable maître. Lors d'un de ces séminaires, il rencontre Franco Donatoni, qui lui prodigue d'efficaces conseils. De 1981 à 1983, il est pensionnaire de la fameuse Villa Médicis à Rome ; en 1988, il est boursier de la Villa Médicis ""hors-les-murs"" aux Etats-Unis. De 1993 à 1995, il est compositeur en résidence à l'Orchestre National de Lyon. Pascal Dusapin est titulaire de maints distinctions, dont le Prix de l'Académie des Beaux-Arts (en 1993), le Prix du Syndicat de la Critique (toujours en 1993), le Prix Symphonique de la SACEM (en 1994), le Grand Prix National de Musique (décerné par le ministère de la culture en 1995), ou deux Victoires de la Musique (en 1998 et 2002). Son catalogue compte près d'une centaine d'oeuvres, parmi lesquelles se trouvent des compositions pour soprano et ensemble instrumental (dont ""Comoedia"" &amp; ""Lumen""), des oeuvres de musique de chambre (dont plusieurs pièces pour violon ou violoncelle solos, sept ""études"" pour piano, quatre quatuors à cordes), des pièces concertantes (dont le concerto pour trombone et orchestre ""Watt"" et le concerto pour piano et orchestre ""A Quia""), des pièces pour orchestre (dont ""Assai"", ""Exeo"" et ""La Rivière"") et des opéras (dont ""Roméo et Juliette"" et ""Perelà, uomo di fumo"").  Pascal Dusapin mit une vingtaine d'années avant de se consacrer à la composition d'oeuvres entièrement dédiées au piano. Certainement à cause (ou grâce ?) du lourd bagage historique contenu dans cet instrument si complexe. La composition des sept ""études"" pour piano s'étale sur cinq années, de 1997 à 2001. Pascal Dusapin considère ses ""études"" comme des ""matriochka"" (poupées russes), ""emboitées les unes dans les autres"". La plupart des ""études"" sont tristes, ce qui confère à cette musique un style de ""lamentation"". Les quatre premières ""études"" forment un groupe qui peut s'écouter (ou s'entendre), à part des trois dernières. La première (la plus longue), s'apparente à un jeu de ""pliages mélodiques"". La seconde, est quant à elle constistuée de ""dépliages rythmiques"". La troisième créée un mouvement harmonique plus important. La quatrième, exaltée (presque enragée), s'accomode aisément à une ""toccata"". La cinquième, la plus curieuse des sept ""études"", est peut-être la plus exubérante. La sixième apporte une fervente passion, ainsi qu'un immense éclat. La septième et dernière récapitule les six premières, en terminant le cycle avec ""une grande tristesse"". Les ""études"" n°1 et n°6 sont dédiées à Alain Planès, l'""étude"" n°2 à Mikhaïl Rudy, les ""études"" n°3 et n°7 à Vanessa Wagner et les 'études"" n°4 et n°5 à Ian Pace, qui créa le cycle dans son intégralité le 16 décembre 2002, au théâtre des Bouffes du Nord à Paris. Le concerto pour piano et orchestre ""A Quia"" fut amorcé dès le lendemain de l'achèvement des sept ""études"" pour piano. Ce qui peut démontrer que les ""études"" auront été des ""études"" préliminaires à ce concerto. En trois mouvements, ""A Quia"" fut terminé sept mois après son ébauche, le 4 février 2002. Le concerto demande un piano, ainsi qu'un orchestre assez moyen (d'une cinquante de musiciens). En réalité, il ne s'agit pas d'un ""concerto"" à proprement parlé, mais d'un ample monologue subjectif, tout en émotion, mis en valeur par un orchestre omniprésent (mis à part au début du troisième mouvement, où le piano déploie une vaste cadence). Dans le texte de présentation des oeuvres accompagnant ce beau coffret, Pascal Dusapin nous explique que réduire quelqu'un ""A Quia"", c'est le mettre dans l'impossibilité de répondre, réfuter tous ses arguments ; être ""A Quia"", c'est ne plus savoir quoi répondre. Pascal Dusapin met en scène l'extrême tension des rapports qui naissent dès que le piano et l'orchestre s'entrelacent. Le piano ne peut s'exprimer qu'avec l'orchestre, en essayant de se confondre avec lui. L'oeuvre fut commandée par le Festival Beethoven de Bonn, en 2002, pour le cent-soixante quinzième anniversaire de la mort de Ludwig van Beethoven.  Ian Pace, créateur du cycle intégral des ""études"", en donne ici une version enregistrée en studio, quelques semaines après la création mondiale, en public. Son jeu est très minutieux, très détaillé, un peu trop à mon goût, car le caractère subjectif de chaque pièce est un peu moins souligné ; dans les ""études"" les plus dévergondées, comme la seconde, la quatrième et la sixième, son jeu est trop ""plastique"" ; une once de folie additionnelle aurait placée ses ""études"" sur un pinacle. Mais, sa technique incontestable n'appelle que des éloges, de plus la prise de son, elle aussi très analytique permet de plonger l'auditeur au sein du piano, l'ivresse sonore est à son comble ! Mêmes constats pour l'interprétation du concerto, enregistré en public cette fois-ci, lors de la création. On attend à plusieurs moments une ""explosion"", une ""pétarade"" (milieu du premier mouvement, millieu du troisième mouvement) ; cela est un peu trop sage, l'auditeur demeure un peu sur sa faim. Mais la encore, la prise de son aidant, les timbres des musiciens de l'Orchestre de Paris sont magnifiques, et le piano de Ian Pace ne l'est pas moins.  A noter les excellents textes de présentation, très fournis et très complets, écrits pour les ""études"" par Ian Pace lui-même, et pour le concerto par Pascal Dusapin en personne et par le musicologue Harry Halbreich.  En bonus des deux compact-discs est joint un d.v.d où l'on peut apprécier le travail du compositeur avec le pianiste, ainsi qu'avec l'orchestre. Le spectateur découvrira un Pascal Dusapin des plus attachants, qu'il souhaitera avoir comme grand frère ! Les explications de ses propres oeuvres sont très pertinentes et intéressantes, tout comme ses précieux conseils prodigués au pianiste et à Christoph Eschenbach, chef de l'Orchestre de Paris."
2,"Il y avait longtemps que l'on avait oublié en France que «Don Carlos» était un opéra français quand le Châtelet l'a repris en 1996. Malheureusement, ce fut avec peu de bonheur car le seul souci qui semble avoir été présent dans l'esprit de ceux qui l'ont monté a été de «moderniser» l'opéra ou pire encore de «faire moderne» (aussi paradoxal que cela puisse paraître, l'opéra n'a jamais été moderne et quand le XXe siècle s'en est mêlé, le genre a bien failli en mourir). Dans le cas de ce «Don Carlos» le résultat est donc navrant. On a d'abord droit à une mise en scène «grunge» qui trivialise l'opéra. Cela ne serait pas grave, car finalement, à part quelques photos, sur le disque on ne la voit pas, mais malheureusement elle imprègne les chanteurs qui se vautrent dans la caricature en perdant tout sens de la noblesse et de la grandeur. Le meilleur exemple est bien sûr Roberto Alagna qui chante donc comme il parle : on retrouve ainsi la clarté de sa diction mais aussi son côté «chanteur de pizzeria». La beauté solaire de son timbre est certes toujours là, mais complètement gâtée par des tics que l'on aurait qualifiés il y a quelques années de faubouriens. Les autres chanteurs sont mauvais à deux exceptions près : Van Dam en Philippe II garde ses appréciables qualités et Hampson en Rodrigue est excellent au point qu'il donne l'impression de porter l'opéra.  La version du Châtelet dure 3h20 mais, modernité oblige, le ballet a été supprimé. Quel contresens quand on sait la place fondamentale du ballet dans l'opéra français : plus que tout autre école d'opéra, l'opéra français est né du ballet. Supprimer le ballet sous prétexte que le public actuel n'apprécierait peut-être pas revient à énucléer «Don Carlos».  Bref, la seule bonne version de «Don Carlos» en français reste celle de Camden Theatre de 1972 avec André Turp retransmise par la BBC."
2,"Je vais être sévère mais ordinairement j'apprécie bien la musique de Comelade, ce qui fait que je peux faire la comparaison avec des albums plus anciens. Quel est le son nouveau ou l'idée originale que Pascal Comelade veut faire passer dans cet album ? On y retrouve les mêmes idées, les mêmes rythmes, les mêmes astuces que dans des albums comme   ou  . Ce ne sont pas les joliesses de ""Catalana de Jazz"" ou ""noia de porcellana"" qui emoustilleront les sens. Ce disque semble être fait pour les fans mais on est loin de la poésie qui pouvait se dégager de l'album  . Qu'est-ce qui sauve cet album en partie ? le dernier morceau ""com un rossinyol amb mal de queixal"" avec lequel le compositeur retrouve une certaine grâce, un certain esprit d'enfance, sa marque de fabrique profonde. Enfin, sachant que Pascal Comelade est fort amateur d'art moderne et contemporain, je ne peux que trouver la couverture de cet album (Les Krims) fort laide et déplacée, peu en adéquation avec sa musique."
5,vraiment genial je les adore depuis obsesion je ne me lasse pas de les écouter et pourtant écouter trop souvent la meme chose lasse mais la non c le contraire  bravo ils méritent vraiment du succés
5,"je ne connaissais pas ce chanteur pourtant j'ai 250 albums de reggae roots et pourtant c'est vraiment super les chants sont sublimes, la musique ( groupe aswad )trop belle du bon roots comme tout les disque de front lines l'autre album ""RASTA"" est tout aussi bien"
5,"Enregistré au mythique Studio One, cet opus crépusculaire est sans conteste l'un des albums les plus roots de cette période, à l'égal de l'Armageddeon Time de Willi Williams. Freddie Mc Gregor y dévoile une profondeur de chant inégalée, à la fois puissante et nostalgique, soutenue par des rythmiques hallucinées qui ont fait depuis la gloire du Studio. Il n'est pas exagéré de dire que ce disque est à placer parmi les dix productions les plus réussies du reggae roots. Absolument indispensable."
5,"Je vous conseille vivement de vous procurer ce CD, qui est splendide, on retrouve une artiste complétement changée, auparavent, je la touvé déjà bien mais aujourd'hui, je la trouve exceptionnel !! Ses chansons sont très belles et dans ses chansons on retrouve une certaine émotion qui envoute notre corps, et c'est une sensation très forte et agréable. Donc voilà, je vous le redis, il faut que vous achetiez ce CD, et je pense que vous ne le regretterez pas."
2,"Booba lache ""temps mort"", son 1er solo. Malheureusement, on est tres loin du niveau des Lunatic. les prods sont irritantes, les textes toujours les memes et entendre le flow de Booba sans celui d'Ali pendant tout un disque est tres saoulant. les featurings n'y changent rien. Bref, un album trop fade, qui manque totalement de profondeur. Malgre tout on peut y trouver quelques perles tels ""Jusqu'ici tout va bien"", ""ma définition"" (malgré une symphonie pathétique) et surtout ""Strass et paillettes"" avec son homie Ali. ""Que le hip-hop repose en paix"" dans la tombe de ""temps mort"". Tant pis, j'ecoute pas et puis c tout."
2,"ah mais que de regrets.. je n'ose imaginer ces chansons pas si mal foutues mais chantées par Tarja bon sang !!!! quel désastre de l'avoir laissé partir. nouvelle chanteuse très moyenne, sans plus, ok-bof. enfin disons qu'elle s'en sort quand meme pas si mal meme si Marco chante de plus en plus... cd pas mauvais au final mais bon faut oublier et ne plus penser que c'est le meme groupe. snif"
2,"Une partie instrumentale très bonne quoi que mon inspirée que d'habitude. PAr contre la nouvelle voix de Nigthwish, Anette Olzon, tient plus des Corrs qu'autre chose. Du coup Nightwish perd 50% de son impact et se fond dans la masse des groupe de métal voir même rock/pop à présent. Dommage...."
5,"Cet enregistrement capté à la Bethanienkirche de Leipzig en avril 1959 s'avère historique à divers titres. Le vénérable orchestre du Gewandhaus y était conduit par un chef de trente et un ans, qui allait prendre sa direction en 1970 et mener la prestigieuse carrière que l'on sait : Kurt Masur ! L'exceptionnelle qualité de la prise de son révèle la palette si spécifique des instrumentistes saxons (les hautbois !) et donne l'impression d'être face aux musiciens tant la restitution est vivante est réaliste. La direction abrupte et passionnée du jeune Masur manque parfois de précision et de raffinement à mon goût mais sa fougue emporte l'adhésion. Laissons la vedette au soliste : Tatiana Nikolayeva (1924-1993), pour qui Chostakovitch avait composé vingt-quatre « Préludes et fugues » en hommage à son triomphe au Concours de Leipzig en 1950. Sans jamais manquer de puissance, la pianiste russe déploie une sonorité riche et surtout sensible : les délicates nuances de son clavier (même dans cet opus qui n'en réclame pas tant...) visent moins l'exploit digital qu'à animer la partition. Nul besoin de situer ce témoignage au sein de la pléthorique discographie de ce Concerto : la sincérité de ce moment musical (bien bref certes) ne s'entend habituellement que lors des plus enthousiasmants concerts."
2,"Je ne suis pas particulièrement fan de la musique de Rachmaninov que je trouve à la limite du larmoiement et de la mièvrerie, ce jugement ne valant que pour moi. J'ai surtout acheté ce CD pour évaluer la prise de son que certains disent très bonne. Bonne, oui, mais pas excellente car le captage est un peu lointain à mon sens, et c'est bien dommage. Pour les inconditionnels (seulement) des sonates de Rachmaninov et Prokofiev."
5,"j'ai découvert la musique de F.Monpou par hasard . Son écriture m'évoque  harmoniquement le monde des grands pianistes de jazz , Jarret , Hancock , bill Evans etc.. très belle interprétation de Martin Jones"
5,"Onze longues années après ""Three Of A Perfect Pair"" qui clôturait la trilogie entamée par le splendide ""Discipline"" en 1981, King Crimson réconcilié avec Virgin publie enfin son nouvel album.  Nul besoin n'est de préciser que mis à part pour les fans aguerris, cet album aux titres et à la pochette étranges fait un peu figure d'Ovni dans le paysage musical d'alors. Pourtant quelques écoutes attentives de ce disque exigeant suffisent à prouver qu'il s'agit (encore) d'un authentique chef d'œuvre."
1,"D'abord ce produit est un plagiat manifeste du groupe anglais Angelis, meme concept et meme pochette, jusqu'aux vetements des enfants, fallait oser!D'aileurs meme les enfants sont ressemblants avec les memes tetes  un peu inquietantes de premiers de la classe (ca rappelera aux initiés un film de Sf anglais des années 60 :""le village des damnés""..). Quant au contenu, c'est bien calibré pour la fete des meres et les gouters d'anniversaire des tout petits, c'est sensé etre frais et mignon, en fait c'est pur marketing, pour surfer sur ""l'effet Choristes"", et absolument plat dans l'interpretation, deja que le repertoire choisi n'est pas des plus passionnant..A fuir donc! Si vous voulez un cd intelligent pour vos enfants je vous propose celui ci, que j'ai ecouté avec plaisir et offert a mes petits neveux qui en ont été ravis"
5,"Ce second opus du trio sud est magnifique, que ce soit sur les compositions originales ou sur des compositions revisitées. Les trois vituoses nous offrent un moment plein de sensibilité, de musicalité. Un pur moent de bohneur et une grande invitation au rêve."
5,"...mais osons néanmoins ces quelques lignes pour les mélomanes qui ne connaîtraient pas cette Symphonie pour chanteur basse, chœur d'hommes et orchestre écrite en 1962, neuf ans après la mort de Joseph Staline. Le poète Yevgeni Yevtouchenko fut un des observateurs les plus lucides de cette époque, et Chostakovitch conçut son antépénultième symphonie à partir de cinq de ses textes, dont le célèbre « Babi Yar » donna son titre à l'oeuvre entière. Du nom du ravin ukrainien de sinistre mémoire, ce poème dénonce violemment la manifestation de l'antisémitisme, évoquant l'Egypte ancienne et quelques cas de l'histoire moderne (Affaire Dreyfus, Anne Franck...) En contraste radical avec l'étreignante émotion soulevée par ce plaidoyer suit un poème sur la force insoumissible de l'humour. « Au magasin » rend hommage à l'honneur des femmes de Russie, puis un lugubre solo de tuba mène à « Peurs », qui replonge dans les sombres ambiances de l'indicible oppression. Introduit par de lumineuses arabesques de flûtes, « Une carrière » apporte enfin un rai d'espérance : affirmer son talent, quoi qu'il en coûte, une allégorie du courage de l'artiste sous la contrainte idéologico-politique ? C'est la présente interprétation, que j'avais découverte lors de sa parution originale dans un coffret de deux microsillons en 1986, qui me fit découvrir ce chef d'oeuvre. Ayant depuis entendu bon nombre d'autres versions, et même si l'on se doit de connaître aussi le témoignage gravé par Kiril Kondrachine avec la Philharmonie de Moscou (Melodyia), je puis dire qu'aucune ne se compare à la puissance dramatique véhiculée par le présent enregistrement par Bernard Haitink, les choeurs et l'orchestre d'Amsterdam. Animée par une ferveur de tous les instants, l'interprétation dirigée par le maestro néerlandais confère à cet opus la vraie dimension qui est la sienne : un des plus profonds et bouleversants monuments de la musique du XX° Siècle. L'écoute de cet album, émotionnellement éprouvant, laisse aussi hagard que l'expression du paysan reproduit sur la pochette du CD."
2,"Valery Gergiev poursuit son intégrale des symphonies de Gustav Mahler sans tenir compte de la chronologie. Après une Sixième Symphonie qui a fait illusion et des Première et Septième décevantes, le chef russe, qui dispose d'un orchestre prestigieux remarquable dans les cordes et dans les cuivres, nous donne de nouveau une lecture puissante et très personnelle de cette Troisième Symphonie de Gustav Mahler qui est l'une des plus mal aimée de son répertoire. Après plus d'1h30 de musique ininterrompue, on reste étonné que les musiciens ne sortent pas épuisés d'une telle épreuve de...force. Le principal reproche est le suivant : à la différence de Pierre Boulez, de Michaël Gielen ou plus récemment de David Zinman auxquels certains reprochent une lecture uniquement analytique et trop froide, Valery Gergiev, qui revendique une interprétation personnelle, ne marque aucun respect pour la partition enchevétrée de Mahler (respect des tempos, choix des instruments) . La direction vigoureuse imprimée à l'orchestre fonctionnne durant le premier mouvement (""Vigoureux. Détermniné"") qui est, honnêtement, le seul assez réussi (les cuivres sont sollicités comme jamais chez Mahler), le 5e avec choeurs passable. Joués sur des tempos rapides, les autres mouvements sont totalement ratés, qu'il s'agisse du 2e (""Menuet. Très mesuré. Ne pas presser""), du 3e (""Sans hâte""), du 4e (""Très lent. Mystérieux. Tout à fait pianissimo"") et surtout du 6e  et dernier (""Lent. Calme. Senti"" ) qui relève de la caricature : Gergiev nous livre un crescendo appuyé presque uniquement sur les timbales en contradiction avec le chant apaisé voulu par Mahler."
2,"Retour d'une version considérée comme excellente en son temps mais qui est en réalité décevante. Elle fut encensée par la critique en son temps (on se demande pourquoi) mais est inversement considérée aujouurd'hui, ce qui est certainement plus correct, quoique excessif. Interprétations froides, prises de son quelque fois étrange : où se trouve l'orgue à la fin de la deuxième symphonie ? On est loin de Bernstein, Boulez ou des références actuelles ! Bien sûr le prix est attractif... 3 fois moins chère que l'intégrale Bernstein ou 2 fois moins que celle de Bernard Haitink"
1,"A part les membres du club très fermé des ""Célibidachiens"" fervents qui aura envie de ce procurer cet objet? Noyé sous l'épaisseur des tempi (une marque de fabrique du chef roumain) ce disque distille un mortel ennui, ce qui est normal pour un requiem. Vite! Rincez-vous les oreilles avec Gardiner!"
5,"Comment cela pourrait-il en être autrement ? Le classique reste encore trop à l'écart de trop de gens qui ne savent pas ce qu'ils perdent et passeront leur vie à côté de toutes ces merveilles . Ce n'est pas une question de goût mais d'ignorance et de négligence de la part de l'Enseignement et des médias beaucoup plus aptes pour abrutir les jeunes . Les belles choses , le respect , l'observation , l'apprentissage , la Nation ont disparus des mentalités .  La drogue et les avalanches sociales conviennent mieux aux fainéants . Titiouaf ."
5,"Noa, une voix sublime et forcément des albums sublimes ! Celui-ci est le premier qu'elle a sorti en france, et il faut le dire, la première fois qu'on l'écoute il fait frissoner et surtout adoucit et agaye l'atmosphère ! C'est un album tout en douceur, de Mishaela à L'ave Maria, interprété avec tendresse, mais aussi un album aux sonorités agréables. Fermez la lumière et vos yeux, allongez vous , écoutez, c'est presque un rêve !"
2,"Parfois entre deux films, David Lynch se déguise en groupe de rock avec un comparse ingénieur du son. Une corde de plus à l'arc d'un artiste protéiforme dont la noire vision du monde trouve ici un prolongement musical. Blues industriel nous dit le bonhomme, l'ambiance générale est lourde, répétitive, on pense à Executive Slacks, Garry Glitter, ou encore Front 242. Classons l'affaire dans la catégorie électro.  Malheureusement, le génie de la pellicule ne se confirme pas sur disque, Lynch n'est pas Badalamenti. Intéressant quand même."
5,"J'attendais ce nouvel album de l'ange morbide, avec appréhension depuis le précédent ""Formulas fatal to the flesh"" qui ne m'avait pas inspiré, je dois dire que celui-ci, me prouve tout le contraire. Je suis un fan inconditionnel de ce combo, je ne compte plus le nombre de fois, les avoir vu en live, avec David Vincent au chant, et que dire du remplaçant : Steve Tucker, il le remplace et haut la main, on croirait sa voix sortie d'outre-tombe. Cet album, respire la maturité, les solos de Trey Azagthoth, sont toujours aussi, subtils et techniques, ont l'imagine martyrisant sa 7 cordes comme un damné. Pete Sandoval, toujours le maître derrière ses fûts. Sur l'album, les titres s'enchainent, avec des rythmes différents, certains lourds, écoutez ""Summoning redemption"". L'album s'écoute d'un trait, et ne lasse pas du tout, sur ""Ageless, still i am"", les breaks, et les mid tempos lourds/rapides, donnent un charme à ce morceau qui ravivent nos oreilles de death métalleux de la vieille époque floridienne. Morbid angel RULES"
5,"Un grand merci à Jonathan Coe, qui, par son roman sur l'Angleterre des années 70 ""Beinvenue au club"", m'a fait découvrir le groupe et cet album...Un univers jazz-rock inspiré, des  influences ""classiques"" indéniables, des compositions raffinées, une fusion réussie, une joie tranquille à l'écoute de cet opus, au coin du feu, par un temps de chien. Indémodable. Et très bien produit."
2,"Eh oui, Tarja n'étant plus là, certains réchignent le nouveau cru de NW. Je les comprends, et je pense que je serais le premier à le rechigner. Soyons clairs et sincères : Anette n'assure pas du tout la relève et n'a aucune grâce à chanter des textes aussi somptueux que ceux de Tuomas. Il faut bien l'avouer, les clips sont très, très baclés, et puis niveau vestimentaire, je suis désolé mais j'ai ris aux éclats en voyant Amaranth. J'avais l'impression de voir une gamine paumée tout droit sortie d'un clip d'un groupe pop/rock, habillée on ne sait comment. Certes, Anette possède une belle voix, mais ça s'arrête là.  En ce qui concerne Dark Passion Play, c'est un album aux sonorités très variées je trouve. Et pour être sincère, il n'y a qu'une seule chanson où j'ai adhéré: ""Meadows of Heaven"". Chacun ses goûts et ses préférences, donc pour ma part, sans Tarja, c'est fini, Nightwish s'enfonce dans l'arnaque. Alors penchez-vous davantage sur son album solo: c'est une petite pépite. Elle marche seule et tant mieux !!!"
2,"j'adore nightwish et j'adore ce cd mais l'instrumental, je n'arrive pas a m'y faire que ce n'est plus Tarja qui chante.  Je pense que nightwish a perdu son identité sans Tarja (même si elle ne faisait que chanter), elle donnait une vrai personnalité au groupe qui les faisaient sortir du lot."
5,"Premier album pour les five true ""thugs"" de Cleveland.Lancés par le maître du gangsta rap en la personne d'Eazy-e(membre des N.W.A) les 5 mc's nous dévoilent toute la panoplie de leurs talents que ça soit dans les morceaux chantés tels que le titre éponyme où dans les titres plus ""hardcore"" tels que ""thuggish ruggish bone"" et ""foe tha love of the money"".Bref un album indispensable pour tout les amateurs de rap !"
4,"Dans la lignée d'un ""Land of the Free"", Gamma Ray revient avec un album rapide, puissant et extremement bien construit. Oubliées les influences ""priestiennes"" d'un ""No World Order"" ou les morceaux aux refrains accrocheurs comme ""Short as Hell"", ""Heaven or Hell"" des albums précédents. Kai Hansen vit, respire, compose heavy Metal et nous le fait clairement comprendre par ses riffs agressifs en diable. Un album à découvrir au plus profond de ses compositions et d'une très grande richesse. It Rules !"
2,"Déjà, ""Into the Unknown"" (1996) m'avait déçu. Je n'avais pas retrouvé le Mercyful Fate capable de pondre d'excellents albums comme ""Melissa"", ""Don't Break The Oath"", ""In the Shadows"" ou ""Time"". Laissé sur ma faim, j'étais prêt à tout leur pardonner 2 ans plus tard (tout le monde peut faire un faux pas après tout) quand ce ""Dead Again"" moribond pointa le bout de son nez.  ""Dead Again""... en effet! Le titre est-il censé faire référence à l'inspiration du groupe? Probable. Quel ennui à l'écoute de ce disque! On ne peut pas reprocher aux Mercyful Fate d'avoir vendu leur âme, non, ils pratiquent toujours ce bon vieux métal ténébreux si particulier... mais sans la flamme, sans le panache, et avec plus de lourdeur et de mollesse! Fatigués, King Diamond et ses acolytes?  La production est pourtant excellente et le groupe nous offre deux morceaux qui sortent du lot: ""Torture (1629)"" et ""Crossroads"" qui, respectivement, ouvrent et ferment cette parenthèse globalement assez ennuyeuse. Franchement, à part les 2 titres que je viens de citer, je ne me rappelle de rien (ah si, ""Mandrake"", pas mal, ça en fait 3). Et pourtant, dieu sait si je les ai écoutés tous mes disques de Mercyful Fate! Mais avec celui-là, rien à faire, je ne l'ai pas trouvé particulièrement accrocheur ou entrainant.   Aïe... Déjà deux albums consécutivement médiocres pour le Fate... est-ce la fin de ce groupe de légende? Que nenni, il reviendra dans une forme éblouissante l'année suivante avec le ô combien supérieur ""9""! Allez, tout est pardonné... finalement. Le groupe a, dans l'ensemble, mené une carrière exemplaire et ""9"" en sera la parfaite conclusion. Oublions donc ce ""Dead Again"" pas franchement indispensable!"
1,"d'un grand groupe de hard, qui s'est trompé de voie, et qui a souvent été frappé par le malheur. Trompé de voie ? Oui à force de lorgner vers le marché américain (et ce dès le premier album ""Hello America""), DefLep a perdu son authenticité, sa place unique de groupe européen de hardmélodieux-limite-FM-mais-pas-trop. Albums trop longs (Hystéria), trop bubble-gum, et moins hargneux (tous ceux qui suivent). Et pourtant quel début de carrière ! Revendiquant haut et fort le Renouveau du hard british, J.Elliot exhibait fièrement son tee-shirt ""marcelisé"" aux couleurs de l'Union Jack. Trois albums assasins (""High &amp; Dry, Pyromania, Hysteria"") pour la concurrence, trois brulots bourrés de hits high energy,  aux choeurs et aux refrains fredonnés par toute une génération de métallos. Tout çà sans grand chanteur, sans super guita-héros ! Simplement un grand et vrai groupe uni dans la réussite et dans le malheur, écrivant tube sur tube. Et puis çà part en vrille !! Contraitement à Maiden, dont le démarrage fût beaucoup plus difficile, Def Lep voulait à tout prix les stades américains. Suivent alors des albums fades aux mélodies de bourrins, pour ados genre LA BOUM n°5. Là ou Maiden a gardé le cap, et du coup gagné le respect de tous, Def Lep a tout perdu. Cet album de reprises étale au grand jour les limites de ce groupe qui a voulu touché le soleil, alors qu'il avait déjà les étoiles. A aucun moment la voix de Joe Elliot, ou ses musiciens pourtant fort bons (voir leur CV), à aucun moment ils ne parviennent à la hauteur des versions originales. On assiste à une ""formatisation Def leppardienne""  de chansons qui ne s'y prêtent pas du tout! Comme le disait le commentateur précédent, Def Lep se contente d'interpréter en y ajoutant uniquement sa marque (ses choeurs principalement) qui ne conviennent absolument pas à la plupart des chansons (Roxy, Kinks, et surtout Thin Lizzy, dont plus d'un s'est cassé les dents en s'attaquant à leur répertoire). Pas assez de folie, pas de surprises. Les insuffisances vocales sont criantes ici, et on voit mal comment Del Lep va encore intéresser la légion métalloide face à Silvertide, The Noodles, Darkness (à la limite), et même face aux diplodocus chéris que sont Ac/Dc, Whitesnake ou Maiden."
2,"Après un premier album un peu inégal(""schizophonic"" sorti en 1999), Geri Halliwell était attendue au tournant pour son deuxième opus. Mais là encore, c'est vraiment dommage qu'il y ait aussi peu de choses à retenir; passés les deux premiers titres très efficaces(""scream if you wanna go faster"" et ""shake your bootie cutie"") qui transpirent l'énergie, le sex-appeal et la bonne humeur, on est ensuite forcé d'attendre le tubesque ""it's raining men"" pour avoir quelque à se remettre sous la dent... Sachant qu'on l'a entendu jusqu'à plus soif sur les ondes, il y aura certainement saturation. Trois titres sur un album qui en compte 12, c'est quand meme peu; dommage que Geri ne sache pas s'entourer des bonnes personnes car sa voix rauque, gouailleuse et sexy mérite vraiment mieux..."
1,Un jolie mélange ou les chansons rythmer ce croise avec des balades a pleurer. Ce petit latin lover risque de faire craquer la france entiere.
2,"Sisqo a signé un album quasiment que RN'B, et j'aurai aimé trouver plus d'energie à son écoute. Hormis deux ou trois titres qui bougent, le reste est mou et fade, et pour un soi disant rappeur c'est pas ce que l'on peut faire de mieux. Par contre, point positif, c'est qu'on l'apprécie bien en bonne compagnie car il rend amoureux, remarque sisqo l'était peut être aussi en faisant lorsqu'il a fait cet album. En fait je suis un peu déçu."
1,"Après un album extra ""Diversité"" suivi d'un live et d'un album réussi ""Dans le Décor"", j'attendais impatiemment le nouvel opus. A peine sorti dans les bacs je l'ai pris sans hésiter. Arrivé dans la voiture, je défait le plastique, ouvre l'habituelle pochette cartonnée et insère le CD dans le lecteur avec la promesse de rythmiques et d'airs si propres à la DUb Inc... J'ai balayé les chansons, d'abord rapidement, puis en écoute complète. Et rien! Rien de bon pour mes tympans. Où est passé le style Dub Inc de Diversité, la simplicité, la Dub? Ou est passée cette énergie qui donne envie de se trémousser et d'aller voir un de leur concert de suite? J'avais adoré Rude Boy, et l'Echiquier mais je n'ai pas du tout accroché aux titres proposés dans ce 3ème CD... On dirait de la world music, certains titres étant électronisé. Dub Inc a certainement les moyens de mieux travailler le son mais il faudrait qu'ils songent à conserver ce qui a fait leur succès et qu'ils n'oublient pas que dans DUB INC il y a DUB... Je ne recommande pas ce CD à ceux qui ont aimé le premier album."
2,"le délai est considérable et j'ai du réclamer car l'envoi avait soit disant été fait (?) et à terme, 2 boitiers cassés ! Le prix ne valait pas l'attente !"
1,"Ya bien les idées, le matériel, le look, mais rien à faire cet album ne décolle pas, et reste après ces années de recul d'une platitude déconcertante. Et en plus ils ne reprennent pas BREAKOUT (du premier album), seul morceau digne de ce nom écrit par ces garçons. Totalement inutile."
1,"Franchement, passez votre chemin, c'est vraiment de la musique pour machos frustrés et mals dans leur peau, pour adolescents prépubères en mal de gonzesse. Bref, une débilité que seul les gens du même acabit peuvent apprécier. De la musique niaise bonne à passer dans les salles de muscu pour exciter les gonfleurs de pectoraux."
4,"Il n'est vraiment pas facile de définir ce groupe. Allons-y tout de même: Army of Lovers pourrait se résumer à un groupe style Abba ou Ace of Base (pour la composition), qui, se travestissant en une troupe de théatre ambulant façon Molière, divertirait avec un répertoire riche et fort varié, composé de musiques de fiesta Espagnole, tantôt soupoudrées de consonnances Africaines ou Orientales, mais que l'on ne s'y trompe pas car c'est en fait de la pop Nordique, mêlée de sons electroniques et de voix venues de la plus décadente de toutes les Renaissances Françaises (et dans cette langue s'il-vous-plaît) On s'affiche grandiloquent mais les compositions ne sont jamais deux fois les mêmes. Petit bémol toutefois: les derniers morceaux sont beaucoup trop électroniques. C'est bien dans l'air du temps mais la qualité est plus que discutable. Ce n'est pas ainsi que l'on survit."
5,"Alors, pour resituer et ceux qui ne connaissent pas : Captain Hollywood faisait partie au tout début du groupe Twenty 4 Seven (""I can't stand it"" pour ceux qui se rappellent) et puis il a démarré ça carrière avec un premier album connu :""Love is not sex"" avec More and More, et Only with you. Très bon album au passage. Puis il est revenu avec Animals or Human qui contient les très connus Flying High et Find Another Way .... La rupture entre ces deux albums est assez marquée tout d'abord par le rythme. Alors que Love is not Sex était plutôt orienté Dance, celui-ci est beaucoup plus rapide entre la techno et la trance par moment. De plus, la première partie de l'album est chantée avec refrain, couplets plutôt entrainants, alors que la deuxième partie du CD est uniquement instrumentale et un peu plus rapide. Cela dit, c'est un très bon ensemble qui est proposé là pour ceux qui souhaitent se rappeler quelques bonnes soirées en boîte. Et ce ne fut pas son dernier opus puisque quelques temps plus tard est sorti The Afterparty, beaucoup plus dans l'esprit de Love is not Sex. Voilà, vous savez tout."
1,"La reprise d Angel de Robbie Williams est une catastrophe! Elle a réussi à briser une des plus belles chansons anglosaxones qui puisse exister! Elle crie dessus et c est fort dommage! C est Robbie qui doit s arracher les cheveux! Cette chanson représente énormément pour des milliers de gens et sa version la ruine. Je me demande comment la maison de disque a pu tolérer cela.  Le reste de l album est léger... Une voix 100% calquée sur celle de Britney Spears! Bref, un pure produit marketing qui ne marchera guèr en France. Un One Hit Wonder sur Angels c est on ne peut plus facile... Dommage!"
1,J'ai pas aimé. La chanteuse n'a pas de voix et chante aussi mal que Jane.
4,"J'Aime Paris au Mois de Mai demeure l'une de mes chansons préférées d'Aznavour (les arrangements récents, plus jazzy, l'ont encore embellie). La Mamma est un sommet d'émotions. Charles Aznavour chante l'amour comme nul autre (Sur ma Vie, Plus Bleu, Vivre avec Toi), certains titres de cet album de 1963-1964 ont des sonorités plus rythmées (Sylvie, Et Pourtant, Ne Dis rien). Sur ma vie, Je t'ai fait le serment, Que ce lien tiendrait, Jusqu'à la fin des temps, Ainsi nous vivions, Ivres de passion, Et mon coeur voulait t'offrir mon nom, Près des orgues qui chantaient, Face à Dieu qui priait, Heureux, je t'attendais..."
4,"si vous aimez NWA, achetez cet album TOUT DE SUITE Je l'ai eu samedi, il est génial"
2,"Attendre 8 années pour un tel résultat... Alors là, NON!!! Comme tous, je suis un fan inconditionnel, mais je préfère largement le précédent opus ""Stiff upper lip"", le plus bluesy des albums du groupe que ce ""Black Ice"" !!! Très peu d'intérêt. Mélodies similaires, peu de riffs qui tuent !!! Une production trop léchée et clean... on entend plus la rythmique que les guitares; C'est tout propre, pour bien passer à la radio sans doute!!!!...  2 ou 3 morceaux sortent du lot tout de même : Big Jack, War machine, Stormy may day - où l'on entend enfin Angus jouer en slide (façon Blues)- et Black Ice. Ne parlons pas des pseudo ""ballades"". Anything goes aurait pu être chantée par Rod Stewart !! Bref, le tout manque cruellement de punch, de patate !!! Alors d'accord, certain diront : Ils ne sont plus tout jeunes, mais alors qu'ils arrêtent où qu'ils jouent du pur blues pépère...  C'est juste dommage de finir une telle carrière sur un album aussi moyen !! En attendant de les voir en Live, mais pessimiste sur la performance... La dernière tournée était difficile, surtout pour Angus qui semblait avoir perdu sa dextérité... A suivre..."
4,"je viens de découvrir le dernier album, je connais acdc depuis peu de temps , j'ai 52 ans ! pas trop tard pour donc! , mais là l'énergie de ""décibel"", ""black ice"" et autres  m'ont transportés vers une émotion vibrante et pleine , les larmes me sont montées aux yeux de bonheur , la voix du chanteur est remplie d'accroches agressive et les rifs de guitare entraine vers des sommets du rock bien posé . Un vrai bonheur pour moi! Que du bonheur Messieurs et Mesdames! A user et abuser!!!"
2,"Alors qu'on pouvait s'imaginer que Phils Collins avait superbement négocié l'après ""But Seriously"" et le virage des années 90 avec le relativement réussi ""Both Sides"", ses dernières productions ne sont pas à la hauteur de son talent et de ce qu'on serait en droit d'attendre de lui. Déjà ""Dance into the Light"" était très moyen, ici c'est encore plus faible. Hormis (il ne s'y est pas trompé) le single ""Can't stop loving you"", aucun titre n'émerge et bien que ce ne soit évidemment pas insupportable, ça sent le déjà entendu mille fois et l'ennui gagne rapidement... Dommage, à réserver aux seuls fans. Je suggère à ceux qui souhaitent découvrir l'oeuvre de Phil Collins d'acheter le best of de 1998 ""Hits"" ou de se procurer ses merveilles des années 80 ""No Jacket required"" et ""But seriously""."
1,"Faut dire la vérité elles veulent rien dire les ""paroles"" ""ou sont passé les hommes batman et flash gotdone"",""toutes les femmes de ta vis en moi réunis""(je vous rassures ""l'album"" si on peut apelé ca comme ca,je l'ai pas on me la fait écouter). A NE PAS ACHETER."
1,"Hormis le fait que,musicalement parlant,il n'y a rien de vraiment nouveau là dedans,une critique négative à outrance,est surement injustifiée.En effet,la seule différence aves les spice girls ou autres bananaramas est que leur casting a été filmé.Ah j'oubliais aussi,chez ""popstars"",on a pris les filles les plus douées en chant et danse,alors que dans ""staracademy"",on a élu la concurrente qui chantait le moins mal.La différence me semble etre importante."
1,"encore et toujours des éloges pour un album de variétés encore plus banal et navrant que le précédent.johnny il est temps de raccrocher dans ce genre trop propre, trop glamour, aucunement rock."
1,"Fan depuis toujours, voila 10 ans que Johnny fait des albums studio sans intérêt. D' ailleurs, seules 2 à 3 chansons nouvelles sont au répertoire des spectacles, et heureusement !!!  Ce nouvel album est de la pure variété qu'on entend tous les jours grâce à d'autre ""brels"" et on a même droit à un rap!!! AU SECOURS !!!!! Il faut arrêter de faire n'importe quoi Mr Hallyday. Pourquoi ne pas chanter ""Bécassine"" ou ""Capitaine Flam"". Les artistes se plaignent du téléchargement illégal, mais franchement, un album comme celui-ci ne vaut pas mieux."
2,"Je suis fan de HIM depuis le début et j'aime chacun de leurs albums mais je suis déçu par dark light. Je crois bien qu'il s'agit là de leur premier faux pas. Cet album cloche, l'inspiration n'est pas au rendez-vous et HIM semble avoir perdu de sa superbe, ou tout simplement de son talent."
2,"Cet album n'est pas mauvais, non. Mais il aurait du être dans le prolongement du style premier de Xandria, il aurait du approfondir le style du premier album au lieu de s'inspirer du Mother Earth de Within Temptation... Les morceaux se ressemblent trop et cela se sent, ils ne sont pas assez travaillés, ils ne donnent pas le frisson, il n'y a pas de réelle personalité dans cet album...  Les morceaux sont là pour plaire sur le coup à un public large, ils n'exploitent pas le potentiel du groupe... Vraiment dommage... Ils ne sont pas foncierement mauvais, mais dignes d'un petit groupe qui sera vite oublié... A moins qu'ils ne se ressaisissent, car le potentiel est là et il a été amorcé par Kill the Sun! En résumé, vite que ce groupe se trouve et fasse aboutir son style avant qu'il ne soit trop tard... Car ils ne rentreront pas dans la légende avec un tel album."
1,"Russell Allen est, mais vous le savez si vous lisez ces lignes, le chanteur du groupe Symphony X. Il est l'une des plus grandes voix d'un genre rendu célèbre par Dream Theater, le metal progressif. Et quelle surprise de découvrir cet album solo dont le style musical est à mille lieux de Symphony X, il s'agirait plutôt d'un vieux hard rock 70's à la Deep Purple, pour n'en citer qu'un. Et quelle déception, par la même occasion, d'entendre ainsi Russell Allen, se ""limiter"" à ce type de chant. Quant aux compositions, très linaires, elles manquent d'originalité. Dans le genre, King's X fait bien mieux. Si les fans de Symphony X ne se jetteront certainement pas sur cet album, je ne vois pas qui le fera étant donné l'anonymat du personnage en dehors des frontières du metal. Alors, c'est sûr qu'il a dû se faire plaisir en enregistrant cet album, mais moi, c'est pas ma came."
5,C'est une honte que ce petit bijou ne soit pas sorti en zone 2. La VHS est quasi introuvable ou à des tarifs terrifiants. Tout est bon dans ce film magnifié par la musique et Burt Lancaster. C'est un moment de pur bonheur. On sort des quantités de versions de navets affolants et de vrais joyaux dorment en attendant... quoi ?
1,"Un album a eviter comme la peste. Benny Benassi a trouve un son super et il en use et en abuse jusqu'a l'ecoeurement! Au bout du troisieme titre on en a deja marre d'entendre la meme chose. Meme si ""Satisfaction"" et ""I love my sex"" sont de tres bons single, le reste de l'album est beaucoup trop repetitif. Bref, sans aucun doute le CD de reference pour les ados de 16-18 ans qui font leurs premiers pas en boite mais rien de bien excitant pour les REELS clubbers. Le son etait bel et bien innovant, mais l'album est completement lassant!!!"
1,"Voix grave, chansons graves, c'est lourd, c'est lent, c'est triste, c'est sans émotion (le titre phare ""cassée"" donne bien le ton de l'album, malheureuseusement c'est celui qui a les paroles les plus banales). La chanson la plus réussie : celle de Voulzy (qui demanderait un timbre plus léger). La chanson la plus fade (il y en a beaucoup) : 14 février. U.M. a misé sur la performance vocale, oubliant l'expression artistique, qu'on cherche en vain...et la ""team Obispo"" ne s'est pas foulée. Passé l'effet ""télé réalité"", que restera-t-il ? Une Chimène Badi qui sans promo fait valoir son exceptionnelle capacité d'émotion, une Carla Bruni à la voix beaucoup moins parfaite, mais avec de superbes compositions, une Nolwenn Leroy c'est moins sûr...le temps fera le tri."
5,J'aime beaucoup cette chanson ! j'espere que le clip sera a la hauteur !
4,"Avant Jeff, une autre voix virtuose, dont les expérimentations folk uniques, contemporaines de Dylan, sont enchanteresses. Un coffret opportun et relativement complet."
5,Et je ne suis pas déçu. Il a une sacré plume. Ses chansons sont magnifiquement ciselées. A écouter et réécouter.
5,"Le premier effort de monsieur falkner est la résultante de son parcours de musicien free lance  pour la fameuse formation Air, guitariste et songwriter pour le groupe monté en partenariat avec Jon brion les grays et de son goût pour les oeuvres de torturés tels que les xtc, des cars et bien sur les beatles...j'oublie surement de vous parler de son partenariat avec  son alter égo Brendan Benson et ses collaborations sporadiques .... Nous sommes en 1996,  fort d'un sérieux background Jason falkner frappe à la porte du label Elektra..... Qu'il l'accueil à bras ouvert . Il veut assouvir son vieu rêve, concevoir, batir et finaliser son disque, nous montrer l'étendu de ses capacités et mettre à nue sa personnalité déchiré et écorché entre amour décu et histoires amère..... Present Author Unknow est captivant, il vous aspire dans un univers peuplé de ballades envoutantes de rocks entrainant souppoudré d'une délicate couche d'énergie débridé. Les titres se révèlent efficace,   le premier I live est un mid tempo dans la tradition power popienne , une batterie en avant les claviers synthetisant le truc et une guitare qui lance un gimmick repetitif.. la voix se livre et lance des i live libérateur comme si jason  se libèrait de quelque chose.. de douloureux. Miracle medicine est légérement plus péchus...les guitares sont là comme avec les grays...les voies sont démultipliés  sur le reffrain un moog joue une mélodie dans l'urgence la pression monte crescendo...Le titre « hectified »suivant je le passe mais ce qui vient est absolument renversant, le style unique de ce créateur est là présent, mes sens sont en emoi, cette mélodie féérique se pose délicatement sur mes tympans abasourdis. Quelle force se dégage de ce reffrain! Tout en appesanteur sa voix plane sur une fréquence divine pour ensuite s'éteindre brusquement et aboutir sur le titre suivant....  she goes to bed  revient à un format un peu plus classique couplet refrain mais le falkner à plus d'un tours dans son sac pour eblouir la gallerie......PAF rebellote  il la joue classique (comprenez musique sophistiqué et hyper chiadé!) pour s'envoller dans les nuages.... La musique pop peut reservé de bonne surprise quand elle est manié entre main d'expert! Le sommet de l'album reste pour moi le titre « afraid himself to be ».... l'histoire d'un type qui fait une déclaration d'amour réel et sincère  à une personne en toute humilitée.... a man afraid of himself to be c'est à dire la peur d'exister... peut être un de ses traits de charactère quand on connait la popularité et la couverture médiatique quasi inexsitante du bonhomme par nos contrées! Domage...."
2,"De très belles voix, de beaux morceaux de musique, zen ... c'est à voir ? Les titres se ressemblent, sauf bien sur la merveilleuse Norma interprétée par la Callas,A écouter en boucle le premier morceau du CD  le reste ...."
2,"La commande s'est bien passée, le produit bien arrivé et dans les délais. Néanmoins le produit n'a pas correspondu à mon attente. En effet, il s'agit de musique synthétisée et non orchestrale, ce que je recherchais. Meilleures salutations. rfs"
5,"Alors que d'autres attendent sagement de mûrir pour enregistrer les sonates pour piano de Chopin, c'est à 27 ans que Simon Trpceski a décidé de se frotter à ce qu'il convient d'appeler un standard, la Sonate n° 2 en si bémol majeur. Entamée à une allure vertigineuse, une première écoute permet sans beaucoup d'efforts d'établir le portrait du jeune pianiste. Puissant avec beaucoup d'aplomb et d'un caractère bien trempé, il est de préférence prompt que mélancolique. D'ailleurs, la célèbre Marche funèbre donnant le tempo du troisième mouvement nous le confirme. En pleine possession de ses moyens techniques, les quatre Scherzos sont abordés avec la même volonté. Pièces sans équivalence, si elles sont teintées de romantisme, celui-ci est plutôt mat que brillant. Difficiles à cerner et souvent très virtuoses, elles ne rebutent pas pour autant le Macédonien qui les élève à un niveau jusqu'alors rarement atteint. Sur un plan purement sonore, là aussi la réussite est à saluer. Le piano est bien proportionné et l'acoustique du Potton Hall de Westleton est merveilleusement mise à profit par les techniciens du son. La dynamique est au rendez-vous et aucune des deux mains n'est trahie dans l'extrémité de son registre : les aigus sont aériens et les graves abyssaux. La dimension de l'effet stéréophonique correspond bien au volume de l'instrument. Au final, nous sommes en présence d'un très beau disque d'un artiste à suivre de très près."
2,"Aprés la sortie de ""Vertical Smiles"", le groupe explose et Rick Medlocke prend donc un chemin solitaire qui l'emmène vers un petit exil volontaire histoire de faire le bilan et de de recharger les batteries. En 1987, il réapparait grâce à  un album ""Rick Medlocke and Blackfoot"". Surpris, les fans découvrent que les indiens ont sérieusement bronzés!!! En effet, Rick pour cet album s'est entouré de musiciens échappés de Mother's Finest, un groupe Funky/Hard d'Atlanta. Le style surprend un peu pour un rocker Sioux ....Ricky se permet sur cet album un break au gout exotique, Black et Soul,  fort prononcé ( à écouter quand même "" Rock'N Roll Tonight et ""Steady Rockin'""). Un exercice de style, qui d'ailleurs ne satisfait pas Rick Medlocke lui même. Un moment d'égarement qui restera heureusement sans lendemain. Le guerrier Ricky ayant bien conscience que cette expérience solo n'avait pas (du tout) convaincu les fans déclara : ""Après cette aventure, aujourd'hui je veux faire machine arrière et retrouver mes racines, il a fallu que je m'en éloigne pour réaliser combien elles étaient vitales pour moi, je le sais les gens attendent le retour du vrai BLACKFOOT.  Wait and see......"
5,"Excellente compilation, assez représentative de la période ROCK de Brenda Lee . A recommander."
2,"pas de polémique: les dream theater sont très très bon techniquement, y'a pas à redire. mais question composition, ils ont toujours été pompeux et à la limite du chiant. maintenant ils donnent dans l'insipide après le plagiat. bientôt l'autoparodie?"
2,"Reading a review of her Canadian debut in Vancouver on April 29, 2007, one would imagine that a rousing standing ovation greeted Ms. de la Salle's performance, hardly the polite slow rising one she received. Ms. de la Salle credentials are impeccable, so impeccable that the CD pitch came before the recital not even at intermission: simply put, we had to like it or else... And the reviewer, not surprisingly, proceeded from the same line of thought. Juxtaposing classical Mozart and neoclassical Prokofiev set the stage for an interesting programme indeed! I concede that the recital started well and the Sonata offered some nice moments although slightly contrived: it was the art of representation as opposed to the art of transformation i.e. the feelings portrayed were acted not lived. Granted, a teenager won't have Mr. Brendel's experience. Virtuosity is a blessing but could also become a curse: in her case this led to exaggerating every move, fast or slow, breaking the classical pulsation. This out of style Mozart culminated with the Rondo which became openly romantic Chopin like, quite surprising for a Paris Conservatory pupil. The final Mozart piece ""Ah Vous dirais-je Maman..."" variations kept on pressing the same obvious style where delicacy, grace and tenderness were absent. By now one was looking towards Prokofiev for relief as it was becoming increasingly evident Ms. de la Salle had nothing new to add to her heavy handed Mozart.  Ms. de la Salle sound is forced rarely graceful. Her shoulders are tense because she presses on keys a lot instead of controlling the hand weight with a free arm. Thus it was no surprise she muscled her way through Prokofiev. The Sonata became an intellectual exercise, virtuosic and abstract. But it is the Romeo and Juliet suite that exacerbated the misgivings of Ms. de la Salle forceful approach. Romeo and Juliet, a tender love story set in a backdrop of violence and family feud immortalized on the silver screen by Zeffirelli. Prokofiev's brilliant music reflects this classic tale and offers soaring moments of absolute beauty. Well, Ms. de la Salle rendition offered none of this. Her insistence to over blow musical traits led her to almost lose it during the syncopated ""Montagues and Capulets"" renowned theme. Moreover, slow movements were painfully lacking colors and dramatic tension as her sound faded quickly, failing to carry her thoughts. The audience mind wandered away, lost count of the movements, and applauded too early or too late... Finally, it was an understandably tired soloist who concluded with a rough Toccata. At 14 Ms. de la Salle in her first recording revealed a promising talent. Her second CD did not confirm as Bach, like Mozart last night, was treated romantically. Her emphasis on the right hand melody at the detriment of counterpoint betrays a rather homophonic hearing. It is truly sad to see how a brutal rise to fame can damage the blooming of a precocious talent and one wishes her to meet a teacher truly interested in freeing her from this over hyped mono dimensional impasse. She would then become the voice the media claims she already is."
5,"Thierry Escaich est un des très grands compositeurs de notre époque.Toutes ses compositions sont riches dans leur construction. dans Chorus, ""la ronde"" par exemple est une oeuvre absolument exemplaire.l'intemporalité est marquée soit par le piano ,soit par les cordes dans un élan fantastique de tension détente. on sent le grand organiste et improvisateur qu'est T Escaich. j'achète au fure et à mesure les CD de TE. Je ne suis JAMAIS déçue, bien au contraire."
5,"One of the best Greek sounds combining lyrics from ancient texts and contemporary Greek poetry: sexy, erotic, poetic and lyrical. Amazing music for you and your companion. Do not miss it, as it is a classic CD."
2,Suzanne Vega serait-elle l'auteure d'une seule bonne chanson.A écouter son best-of on sort avec l'impression que oui. Les autres sont fades et sans grand intérêt. Au total c'est décevant...

5,"quel groupe,quel producteur,quel mc.Tout est bon.Apres l essai reussi du premier album ""no more mr. nice guy"" dj Premier et le mc Guru en remettent une couche pour prouver au monde la valeur de la musique noir et de ce que la planete prenait pour une mode ,le Rap.Et avec Gangstarr le rap a trouver ces lettres de noblesses,si si si,rien que ca.La facon qu a dj premier de scratche les voix releve du genie ainsi que ses beats lourd,hard core,hypnotique accompagne par son mc Guru qui balance ses lyrics ,pur vision street des probleme de la vie,pas de fioriture,pas d eau de rose,pas de gants,tout est dit cash.Et quand on ecout ces deux lascars on a cette eternelle impression de douceur et de dureter, cette signature que l on retrouve chez les plus grands de l epoque:Marley marl,Pete Rock,Terminator x....Bref cet album est tout simplement une des pages du livre d or du rap."
4,"On retrouve dans cet album des titres non diffusés sur nos ondes  et qui sont de qualité : je veux parler de titres tels que Rushing, The sky is broken ou My weakness, qui semblent nous attirer vers un monde plus paisible ou Everloving, un titre où la coordination des instruments en présence est simplement merveilleuse. Les rares tentatives de techno pure (plage 7) sont moins intéressantes et les références au rap (plage 9) n'ont rien à faire dans cette somptueuse oeuvre qu'est l'album de Moby et que tous les amateurs de "" Musique"" se doivent de posséder !"
5,"Le film étant d'une extrême qualité, on esperait la Bande Originale au même niveau. Et c'est en écoutant ce CD que l'on s'apercoit combien John Ottman, qui s'occupa des musiques du film, fit un travail extraordinaire. Chaque morceau est emprunt de l'univers fantasmagorique du film, de l'introduction magistrale réunissant des notes désormais incontournables, au générique final en passant par le sublimissime ""Cerebro"", qui constitue en soit une véritable ode à la magie et une invitation au rêve. On l'aura compris, cette Bande Originale est une réussite totale, et les fans retrouveront aisement l'esprit du film, qui sait rester fidèle au comic dont il est adapté."
2,"Etant un grand fan de Mobb Deep j'attendais beaucoup de cette album qui n'est malheureusement pas à la hauteur de mes espérances. Heureusement il y a quend un bon titre, un titre excellent même mais qui ne justifie pas à lui seul l'achat de cet album décevant (le titre est The Learning(BURN))"
5,"Le cd n'étant pas sorti, je ne peux pas dire ce qu'il vaut... mais j'étais à ce concert du 11 novembre de William Sheller... En quelques mots : FORMIDABLE... LE concert du siècle !!! quelques 46 chansons... presque 4h de musique... 6 bis... et nous sommes resté debout 10 à ovassionner l'artiste tellement le concert fu génial et le moment magique !  Dans ce cd vous trouverez uniquement les titres manquant à Olympiade (2CD)... Sheller, un grand moment de musique !"
1,"Marbles est inintéressant de bout en bout. Au-delà du fait que les premiers qualificatifs venant à l'esprit sont « lancinant » et « soporifique » (« Angelina », même parcouru par la guitare sibylline de Steve Rothery est un ambassadeur du genre), ce disque est surtout dépourvu de la moindre émotion : un comble pour un groupe dont c'était l'apanage depuis des lustres. Marbles s'engouffre dans tous les clichés du genre et se jette dans l'auto-parodie. Il s'englue tout seul, au pire dans des arrangements pompeux et sans âme (le final de « Invisible Man », à grand renfort de chœurs et de guitare solo) ou au mieux dans une redite assez maladroite des dernières livraisons, comme sur « Marbles I » qui évoque le joli « This Is The 21st Century », figurant sur le précédent album. Même la voix, toujours aussi magique, de Steve Hogarth, ne parvient pas à provoquer ici le moindre frisson. Elle se contente de hanter ce navrant effort et frôle même parfois l'insupportable comme sur le final de « Invisible Man » ou de « Neverland ». Seul ""Ocean Cloud"", hélas seulement sur la version double en édition limitée, est digne d'intérêt. Ce titre ne sauve hélas pas le reste du naufrage..."
5,"Dans cet album, je retrouve effectivement les accents du sud. La musique y est chaleureuse et généreuse. La voix d'Hank Williams Jr se prête au jeu subtil du blues sur l'un des morceaux, je vous laisse la surprise, cela vaut largement le détour... Quant aux autres morceaux, vous y retrouverez des notes typiquement Bluegrass (pour les non-initiés c'est un genre de country des années 50-60), mais modernisées... C'est assez étonnant et en même temps pas tant que ça, sachant que son père était un des meilleurs dans ce style musical. Cet album se laisse écouter tout en douceur..."
5,"Si vous aimez le blues et les chanteurs français, ce disque est pour vous. Cabrel, Goldman, Personne et bien d'autres se sont réunis le 11 juin 2001 pour cette soirée au Club Med World pour célébrer le blues. Tous les plus grands standards sont présents dans ce disque qui permet également de faire découvrir le blues aux néophytes Alors n'hésitez plus et achetez le!"
4,"Sixième disque de ce jeune (on est en1994) bluesman. Blues sophistiqué, tendance ""big band"" avec cuivres et choeurs féminins....., pas ce que j'affectionne habituellement, mais force est de reconnaître que l'ensemble est d'une ""pêche"" incroyable, tenu par un duo basse/batterie d'enfer! Peterson assure le chant d'une voix chaude, indéniablement bluesy, la lead guitare et les claviers (piano, orgue). L'ensemble est très éclectique : blues,R'n B, soul,funk, rock, gospel mais très cohérent et jamais ennuyeux, avec des reprises remarquables de ""up from the sky"" de Hendrix et ""you haven't done nothing"" de Wonder. Les solos de guitare sont légions et le point culminant du disque est le blues lent éponyme de 7 minutes: un solo de guitare remarquablement bien construit dans lequel Peterson arrive à faire ""pleurer"" sa Strat avec une densité incroyable! Bref, du bon blues, paufiné, certes, mais qui balance terrible!"
5,"Alors que la mort de Bon Scott pouvait sonner comme la fin du groupe, c'est à la demande des parents du défunt chanteur que le groupe australien décida de continuer. Bien lui en a pris. Si la voix de Brian Johnson a pu en dérouter certains, le registre musical est inchangé et l'assiste rythmique plus carrée que jamais. Sans être sombres, les titres sont graves, à commencer par le vibrant et introductif ""Hells Bells"" en forme d'hommage à Johnson. Avec cet album dont 'Back in Black' et 'Shoot me All nite Long' constituent les singles immanquables, AC/DC offre le plus beau cadeau pour faire perdurer l'esprit de Brian Johnson."
2,"Comme beaucoup, j'ai adoré Fever To Tell, avec ce son qui sonne très punk rock des années folles. Malheureusement ici, les Yeah Yeah Yeahs commencent par deux morceaux tout ce qui a de plus basiques et pas très rock'n'roll, ça sonne creux et on reste totalement déçu, voire même surpris par la pauvreté de ces deux morceaux, tant les YYY nous avaient proposez un son propre à eux avec leur premier album. Avec Fancy, les Yeah Yeah Yeahs relèvent un peu le niveau et se réveillent enfin, et Karen O, la chanteuse, nous sort des cris à la Queenadreena. Too dark, so good. Phenomena et Honeybear sont ensuite plus joyeux et assez sympatoches et restent Yeah Yeah Yeahs dans le style, même si les riffs et la batterie sont beaucoup moins aggressifs. Cheated Hearts et Dudley sont ensuite des titres assez moyens qui sont moins biens que les titres moyens du premier album, même si ça s'écoute, ça manque de quelquechose, de hargne peut-être. Mysteries se vénère un peu et on sent un relant de hargne qui nous avait frappé sur le premier album mais là encore, c'est mou et c'est banal. The Sweets est le morceau acoustic de l'album mais là, ils auraient pu s'abstenir tant on ""s'embête"" depuis le début. Je n'ai rien contre les morceaux calmes, au contraire, mais là, celui-ci est très moyen et ralentit encore plus l'album. Warrior prolonge cet ennui jusqu'à la 2ème minute lorsque Karen O pousse un peu la voix, et nous réveille pour nous laisser écouter un Turn Into qui sonne très actuel et pâle à côté du premier opus. Finalement, cet album ne sonne plus punk rock des années 70 et à mon grand regret, sonne plutôt rock actuel, pop-rock je dirais même, et du coup, il est assez banal et aucun titre ne m'a vraiment accroché. Tiens, jvais me réécouter le premier album."
5,"Troisième opus des Mancuniens et pour la première fois des visages clairement affichés(quoique plutôt anamorphosés),histoire de répondre à leurs détracteurs qui leur reprochaient une franche austérité.Comme toujours chez New Order,la musique se suffit à elle-même et ""low-life"",grand frisson de l'année 1985, apparait comme l'album le plus beau et le plus mystérieux du groupe.La mélancolie qui parcourt ces huit plages nous prend pour ne plus nous lâcher.Entre mélodies pop-rock(les excellents ""love vigilantes"" et ""sunrise"")et incursions électro-pop(""subculture"",""perfect kiss"",ou encore le sublime ""this time of night""),""low-life"" conserve cette   étrangeté qui fait de lui un disque qui concourt sérieusement à la postérité."
5,"Cette compilation regroupe 16 titres des trois albums d'Hervé Cristiani parus pendant les années 80.  Bien qu'une réédition de ces 3 albums sur CD serait la bien venue, cette compil donne déjà un bon aperçu des talents d'Hervé Cristiani comme Auteur / compositeur / Interprête."
1,"Quand on connaît et reconnaît l'immense talent de compositeur de Laurent Voulzy, son incroyable acuité mélodique, on peut regretter qu'il se laisse aller à nous offrir un disque d'ambiance et composé uniquement de reprises, aussi bien choisies soient-elles ! C'est censé être la bande-son de nos vacances à la mer? Dommage je préfère rester en ville et éventuellement écouter les originaux."
4,"Après plusieurs écoutes de cet album, je ne suis pas si déçu que cela. Malgré certains affreux remixes qui destructurent et défigurent la chanson originale (""Sans contrefaçon"", ""L'Âme-Stram-Gram"", ""Optimistique-moi"" et ""Désenchantée""), de jolies perles plus ou moins hardcore (""C'est une belle journée"", ""Je t'aime mélancolie"", ""California"") et des remixes franchement très inspirés (""L'Instant X"", ""Libertine"", ""Pourvu qu'elles soient douces""). Je voudrais néanmoins m'occuper de certaines critiques à l'égard de cet album : je suis surpris de voir que les fans qui le descendent ignorent que c'est un album réalisé par Polydor avec l'accord de Mylène Farmer et non pas un album DE Mylène Farmer. Mylène n'a jamais pris personne pour une vache à lait (ou alors tous les artistes l'ont fait), personne ne m'a mis un couteau sous la gorge pour l'acquérir (et pourtant, je ne suis pas un fan absolu, loin de là, plutôt un amateur éclairé qui sait dire ce qui ne va pas et ce qui est bon) et ceux qui n'en voulaient pas après un excellent best-of et un très bon album live n'étaient pas obligés de l'acheter. Car de quoi parle-t-on ? Personne n'avait promis en 2003 un album inédit, ce sont certains fans qui ont une fois de plus fantasmé et fabulé. La déception de ces personnes est logique, mais ce n'est pas la faute de dame Farmer. Arrêtons donc les débats stériles pour nous pencher véritablement sur la musique, qui n'est pas exceptionnel mais pas horrible non plus ici."
1,"je trouve cet album vraiment en dessou de ce que manu chao nous avait donné dans son ancien album. C'est trop repetitif,pauvre en parole, on a vraiment l'impression que cet album est constitué de face b non abouties. J'espere que le prochain album sera plus travaillé."
5,"Soyons franc, passé 1981, AC/DC ne nous avait plus vraiment seduit que par quelques titres sur les albums. Le mythe etait la, le jeu de scene aussi, mais le groupe n'inventait plus rien qui cassait des briques (ni des ""balls""). ET la, surprise, on ne s'attend pas a quelque chose de correct, de ce groupe qui depasse largement la quarantaine. ""Hard as a rock"" annonce déja la couleur: inspiration melodique, rythmique accrocheuse, riffs travaillés et accrocheurs. Ce sera ainsi pour tout le disque, avec des retours aux sources du groupe (le blues), par des rythmique plus efficaces et accrocheurses et moins ""tape-à-l'oreille"". Fini l'agressivité gratuite, les effets gratuits, voila de la vraie musique hard rock qui sait faire plaisir aux oreilles par sa musicalité et sa rythmique. De plus, la prise de son est excellente, ce qui amplifie encore (quand on a le materiel adequat) le plaisir musical! Ben tiens, rien que d'y penser, j'ai encore envie de le réécouter..."
2,"J'ai beau avoir écouté et réécouté cet album, je dois avouer que je ne partage pas du tout les opinions des autres auteurs de critique qui voient en lui l'album du renouveau. Je m'explique...nous avions quitté le Priest (Rob Halford en tête !) avec un album parfait ""Painkiller"" en 1990  qui faisait suite à quelques albums honnêtes mais un peu mou du genou (""Ram it down"" notamment en 1988) et qui alliait à merveille la puissance rythmique et mélodique du groupe. A l'écoute de ce Jugulator, que dire ? On ne peut pas contester la puissance des titres, c'est heavy, très heavy (voire carrément trash !)et servi par une production infaillible. Mais deux choses sautent aux oreilles : 1)Tim Owens aussi bon soit-il n'égale absolument pas le père Rob 2) le groupe a semble t'il oublié ce que le mot ""mélodie"" signifie...et c'est là que le bas blesse."
5,"Album super réussi. Si vous ne l'avez pas, prenez le vite!!!! C'est vraiment excellent!! La première écoute, on sait pas trop quoi penser mais au bout de la deuxième, c'est fort et aprés...de mieux en mieux!!! Allez-y, ne perdez pas de temps!!!Achetez-le!! Vous pourriez le regretter!!!"
5,"Entre pop et folk, Starsailor nous livre un troisième album qui mérite qu'on y prête attention. La douce voix de James Walsh nous entraine bien loin de notre quotidien. 11 titres, 38 mn, un album à écouter et à découvrir ... que du bonheur !!"
5,"une chanson....deux  chansons ......troix....quatres... Oh Bonheur d'écouter et ré-ecouter cet album sublime ..... Dans l'esprit soul,les textes de cet album me rappelent à des sentiments passés et présents, elle à touché les points sensibles, je le conseil à toutes les sistas et aux brothers pas fâchés avec leur sensibilité...."
1,"Cet album est étonnant,Capdevielle a toujours était étonnant et dans la voix d'Emma Shapplin c'est percutant.Ecoutez Atylantos,c'est aussi du lyric facile a écouter meme quand on a pas l'habitude des opéra ou du classique,'étonant non?'Bravo à Capdevielle.Vive Carmine Méo..."
2,"Ce disque serait l'oeuvre d'un p'tit nouveau, j'aurais dit ""pas mal foutu"" mais venant d'une icône de la chanson Française j'ai envie d'être plus sévère. Ok, les textes sont parfois assez percutants et certains d'entre eux comme ""Les faussaires"" sont vraiment tres efficaces. En revanche les mélodies, les arrangements, ont été entendues mille fois (sur des albums du même auteur ou autres J.Brown...) et je veux bien parier que ce CD ne sera bientôt plus diffusé que par RFM et Nostalgie, radios stars de la rengaine. Les adeptes de ce genre de variété seront forcément comblés, mais pour moi faire du ""sous Dire-Straits"" à notre époque ce n'est quand même pas tres novateur, voire même un peu fatigant..."
2,"Et oui comme tout le monde je me suis précipitée pour l'acheter...! Mais quelle déception ! Bien que les textes soient sensés, les mélodies sont lentes, pas très jolies et on s'ennuie !! Ou est passé le vrai cabrel avec ses mélodies rythmées ?"
2,"..peut-être, mais aux sources de quoi? De Metallica? C'est somptueusement raté. Après un tapage médiatique nous vantant que Metallica est de retour, à l'écoute de l'album, ""Death Magnetic"" serait encore en détour plus qu'un retour à une quelconque époque révolue (Black Album et avant), comme l'ont été Load et Reload.  Ce n'est plus Metallica, il n'y a pas de ""mélodies"" et James Hetfield ne chante plus - c'est toujours les mêmes gueuleries typique du métal actuel- et donc impossible de retenir un titre plutôt qu'un autre. Certes il y a un effort de création musicale (et surtout de production par rapport à St Anger) qui peut éventuellement nous rapeler le bon vieux temps, avec des solos de guitare, solos que Kirk Hammett trouve ringard (voir le documentaire Some kind of Monster). Moralité? Metallica se trouve encore dans un état de convalescence post St-Anger/Some kind of monster. Manifestement, ils sont vraiment devenus vieux et à l'image de la pochette de l'album, je me demande si Metallica n'a tout simplement pas apporté les derniers clous à leur cerceuil. J'ai bien peur que Metallica soit mort. C'est fini. Comme AC/DC. Reste les vieux albums, chefs-d'oeuvres absolus et que je réécouterai sans cesse."
2,"Jean Michel Jarre nous signe un album très Jazz. Malheureusement je n'aime pas ce style de musique, vous comprendrez ma déception. Peut-être à la longue je vais aimer... Fini le temps d' Oxygène, Equinoxe, Chronologie et autres... Depuis Métamorphoses, Jean Michel veut nous dévoiler une autre face de sa personnalité. Difficile de le suivre dorénavant. A acheter si vous êtes seulement très Jarremania."

5,alors que certains choisisse de faire des album de ''metal calme'' pour attirer la masse et surtout la tune. Ici on ne rigole pas chaque morceau est puissant sans etre repetitif pour autant . Il y a egalement une bonne utilisation de l'electro sans tomber dans la faciliter . l'ensemble de lalbum peut s'ecouterdu debut du debut a la fin sans aucun probleme . A noter la presence d'une reprise des beatles fraccassante!! Leur deux autres album sont aussi geniaux bien que j'ai une preference pour celui ci
5,"Grosse claque rapologique !!! Ce 1er opus de Group Home, alias Lil' Dap + Melochy the Nutcracker, est une bombe. Les deux Mc's se completent parfaitement grace a leurs flows époustouflants. Aucun track n'est a jeter. De plus, cet album a été entièrement produit par Dj Premier, qui propose des sons differents de Gang Starr tout en  respectant le style Group Home (a savoir sombre et cru) comme il a pu le faire avec Jeru. Resultat : on atteint des sommets avec des titres tel ""Livin' proof"", ""Inna city life"" ou ""Supastar"". Bref, c'est un classic de chez classics. INDETRONABLE !"
5,"Ce mix d'Armin van buuren diffère assez de ses autres productions et pour cause : il y a un public en face. On se sent faire partie du concert avec Armin qui fait tout pour que l'ambiance ne baisse pas. Il en résulte un mix très varié et très frais qui respire la fête et la relation entre un DJ et son public. Si le underground vous rebute et que vous préférez davantage le son type Ibiza, ce CD est pour vous."
1,Il aurait dû s'arrêter avant cet album qui n'apporte rien de nouveau. Reprise de ses recettes précédentes sans grande innovation. Inutile de l'acheter car de toute façon vous allés être matraqués par les médias. Le marketing reste le seul domaine où il est à la hauteur. C'est dommage pour quelqu'un qui se prétend musicien et chanteur...

1,"Chez Vader, on a jamais fait dans la finesse. Ni dans l'originalité. Mais par contre on sait faire péter les tympans de l'auditoire et dégoter quelques grands hymnes immanquables en live ( comme ""This is the War"" tout simplement ! ). Dans cet album, on s'ennuie du début à la fin. Aucune originalité, intro lamentable ( faite avec des claviers Bontempi ), batterie ultra répétitive et franchement nulle ( oui ça va vite ... et après ? ), aucune inventivité dans les accords ... A éviter à tout prix ! ceux qui veulent découvrir Vader devraient se rabattre sur les premiers albums ou même sur This is the War qui était suffisamment court ( pas le temps de s'ennuyer ), expéditif et mieux bâti au niveau musical."
5,"4° album et pas une ride: LE death metal des initiés. On pourrait même dire que cet album va plus loin que ""Failure for gods"" non seulement du fait du son énorme, mais surtout de compo monstrueuses où la puissance du groupe se mêle à une complexité délirante mais jamais indigeste. Le plus fort chez Immolation reste cette capacité à vous transporter dans un chaos brutal et à vous broyer sans transition sous une chape de lourdeur inégalée (en comparaison, Suffocation reste un groupe de débutants et Incantation un groupe primaire...). Un album qui fait du bien là où ça fait mal et qui repose les bases du death quand des groupes ""références"" en viennent à s'obliger à innover (souvent, c'est pas terrible) pour espérer garder une crédibilité (n'est ce pas, Morbid Angel...)"
2,"Je salivais déjà et me frottais fiévreusement les mains à l'idée d'écouter le deuxième volet de la saga entamée en 1989 par le sieur Réa. A mon sens, le premier album était même l'album majeur de la longue et prolifique carrière de cet artiste peu connu si ce n'est par un ou deux tubes entendus ça et là au détour de quelque émission radiophonique. Ce « road to hell pt 2 » relevait donc un défi important mais connaissant le talent du bonhomme, tous les espoirs étaient permis...c'est du moins ce que je me disais avant l'écoute du disque. Malheureusement, les premières mesures m'ont vite ramené sur terre ! Ce second volet n'est en aucun point comparable à son glorieux prédécesseur sur le plan musical et Réa se révèle au mieux peu inspiré mais parfois carrément hors jeu en utilisant des rythmes électro qui ne collent absolument avec sa voix bluesy éraillée et son jeu de guitare si caractéristique. Je ne peux donc que regretter que cet album soit présenté comme le prolongement d'un chef d'œuvre alors qu'il n'en est qu'un ersatz de bien mauvaise qualité. Fans de rock bluesy, jetez vous plutôt sur les précédents albums et notamment le joyau « road to hell » de 1989 pour mieux apprécier tout le talent que peut déployer l'artiste..."
5,j ai decouvert umberto tozzi en meme tant que mon mari car il en etait un fan; depuis chaque fois que j ecoute ses chansons cela me donne des frisson. un album magique prenez le temp d ecouter sa voix et ses paroles elles sont magnifique
4,"Paul Jackson, Bill Summers, Mike clark... Tout est dit dans ces trois noms. Si vous aimez les Headhunters avec H. Hancock ou sans, vous aimerez cet album! ""Evolution Revolution"" ca fait du bien a entendre des albums comme ca, surtout de nos jours ou l'on confond trop souvent groove et commerce... A Acheter d'urgence!!! Appuies sur le bouton jaune!!!"
1,Avant d'acheter il serait souhaitable d'avoir la liste des chansons pour chaque CD de Dave Sheriff...possible ? merci d'avance
5,"Un album dans la continuitée de californication;les red-hots maitrisent parfaitement ""leur"" technique musicale et se font un réel plaisir en travaillant les effets et les coeurs....Un album qui va plaire aux anciens comme aux nouveaux.Les californiens frappent...avec un son incomparable quel que soit l'instrument utilisé."
5,"un album pas trop connu en france... et pourtant, c'est un album d'anthologie, veritablement exceptionnel!!!!"
5,"Ce n'est peut-être pas le meilleur album de Metallica (leurs 5 premiers albums sont au dessus de celui-ci, notamment MASTER OF PUPPETS considéré le plus grand album métal de l'histoire), mais en tout cas c'est un de ceux que je préfère. Il est quand même bien meilleur que RELOAD et ST ANGER. C'est l'album qui marque un virage dans la carrière du groupe par son côté moins métal et plus commercial qu'auparavant. Néanmoins j'apprècie tout de même car j'aime le rock en général, qu'il soit pop ou hard. C'est pourquoi je ne suis pas déçu par cet album au contraire des grands puristes métalleux. Si vous n'êtes pas focalisé que sur le pur métal et ouvert à d'autres styles rock, penchez-vous sur cet album que je trouve fort appréciable."
4,"C'est un bon album, avec beaucoup de coeur et d'enthousiasme à la clé pour la production. Je ne lui accorde que 4*, à la différence avec ""V"" que je trouve plus subtil et plus musical."
2,"Showbiz m'avait enchanté. Je me disais, un peu opportuniste, mais soyons honnête, y'avait du talent et de belles chansons. Origin persistait, on sentait le mal à se renouveler, malgré citizen erased et micro cuts qui sont à mons sens les grands moments de l'album au niveau créatif, le reste misait sur du re-showbiz. Pardonnable, le tournant du 2è album n'est jamais facile. Absolution m'aura définitivement fâché avec muse. A moins qu'ils ne se remettent sérieusement en question, j'arrêterai de les suivre. Trop prévisible, trop braillard - il serait temps de passer la crise d'adolescence -, trop lassant, tout laisse la même impression : un goût de déjà-vu. Alors oui, certainement, depuis le temps ils commencent à maîtriser la formule, mais il n'y a absolument rien de neuf, pas de prise de risque, tout est trop facile à mon goût. Je laisserai absolution à ceux qui aiment, et retournerai vers placebo : tant qu'à être barré, autant que ce soit pour de bon. L'autre surprise, c'est au niveau des paroles. Bellamy passe peut-être 8h par jour sur sa gratte, autant sur son piano - technique, technique quand tu nous tient : c'est pas un album, c'est un manuel ! - mais alors quel temps reste-t-il pour écrire des paroles ?? Peut-être 5mn dans le bus avant d'aller au studio... Je les trouve vraiment plus pauvres que jamais, et cette dimension de l'écriture leur manqua toujours selon moi. Mais après tout, tant que ça gueule, les paroles on s'en fout. Si vous ne connaissez pas muse, ça reste un album correct, ça vaut certainement plus que 2 sur 5. Mais j'attendais tellement plus de leur part... Tout ceci n'est que mon avis."
2,"ok je suis fan de Muse depuis showbiz,mais la non...c est quoi c et album avec 3 bonnes chansons!je crois que je vais me remettre a ecouter mes bons vieux cd de radiohead..."
5,"Il n'est pas nécessaire d'aller faire bruler un cierge avant de se précipiter sur ce nouvel opus des Muse... Encore une merveille ! Tout y est : mélodies envoutantes, la rage de Matthew Bellamy, la violence d'un groupe d'écorchés vifs... Le ciel s'est un peu obscurcit en nous proposant un ""Apocalypse Now"" ou en nous kidnappant avec un ""Stockholm syndrome""... L'air du temps sans doute : Pendant que Muse nous donne l'Absolution, IAM aimerait bien Revoir un Printemps ! Alors, allez en paix mes enfants..."

5,"Avec leur look de bucherons directement sortis du grand Nord, les Spiritual Beggars nous assenent des riffs taillés à la hache et surtout à la sueur de leurs fronts. Ce trio joue une sorte du blues tres heavy teinté d'un esprit que ne renierait pas certains groupes des années 70. Les morceaux sont autant de classiques pour quiconque aime le rock sans concession."
5,"Si vous êtes en quête d'originalité cet album est pour vous. OVNI musical a base de piano ,violon, guitare acérée et chanteur à la voix aérienne (un peu comme le chanteur de dredg), composition un peu progressive (du mars volta en version de 4 minutes par chanson) et producteur ...david bottrill( producteur de tool bien sûr). voila pour les presentations. Alors? Bien votre première impression sera surement..putain mais c'est quoi ce groupe! Mélangeant differents styles piano violon, melodies complexes et accrocheuses, originalité.. on tient enfin un CD qui révélera son potentiel qu'après plusieurs écoutes.. à ecouter pour vous faire une idée Kyla Cries Cologne, ou Tall Tales Taste Like Sour Grapes..Le genre d'album ou si un titre vous plait vous aimerez tous les autres (ce qui est en fait assez rare...). bref, un ""must have"" pour tout les amateurs de bon rock , un peu déçus par les dernières productions du moment (linkin park, staind et j'en passe) et toujours en quête de l'album qui squattera leur Ipod..."
5,"Que me diriez-vous ? Le meilleur album de l'année 2007, catégorie reggae. Tout d'abord la voix formidable, sensible de ce chanteur, ensuite des riddims  qui enchantent où se posent telle l'abeille sur la jolie fleur, des textes à l'écriture soignée. J'avoue que le titre ""leave the trees"" me met de bonne humeur, tant sa fraîcheur est presque palpable mais d'autres titres valent des rivières aux reflets d'argent et je vous laisse savourer cet album positif qui chasse d'un coup le gris qui nous entoure."
1,"je suis profondémmet déçus par ce nouvel album , on pouvait attendre mieux!!excepter la chanson qui est aussi le titre de l'album:bright liht , le reste de l'album est completement nul en tant que fan de billy je pensais qu'il serais mieux et ne je ne peut que vous conseiller de ne pas l'acheter!!!"
4,"Ah !, Ah ! peuvent ricaner certains, A-ha et leur look de coiffeurs 80's en virée sont de retour pour cachetonner en surfant sur la vague 80's. Et pourtant, les A-ha ont évolué depuis le raz de marée de tubes démarré en 1985. Leur dernière brassée d'albums datant des années 2000 montrent une qualité de composition et de mélodie sans pour cela négliger le rythme. Malgré les années, le son A-ha reconnaissable entre tous et porté par la voix versatile de l'éternellement jeune Morten Harket continue à présenter un intérêt.  Leur dernier album Analogue de 2006 offrait une palette diverse mais de qualité avec des morceaux tricotés avec talent.  Même si les A-ha sont moins présents sous les feux de la rampe en France, ils restent très populaires en Europe du Nord. Cet album démontre que l'engouement des fans est bien fondé  car les A-ha ne déméritent pas.  `Foot of the Mountain' remonte dans le temps pour A-ha avec un fort emploi de synthé, pour des introductions sautillantes et des accompagnements vrombissants.  Le cap de la quarantaine atteint, les jeunes norvégiens font une musique plus mûre mais toujours avenante. Pour preuve, le titre éponyme de l'album `Foot of the Mountain' offre 3'55'' de quasi perfection musicale ; belle session d'un giflage joyeux de cymbales.  Un vrai délice pour lequel la touche répétition reste souvent active.  `Nothing is keeping you here' sort également du lot avec cette voix toujours chaleureuse.  Malgré leur volonté de retour aux sources, la sonorité Orgue Bontempi d'intros au synthé dans `Bandstand' et `Riding the Crest' font sourire.  Le reste de l'album est à découvrir et vaut le détour pour un groupe qui sait jouer la différence et qui prend le risque de se remettre au pied de la montagne du succès.  ""...we could stay there and see how it ends. » Fabien Jacquot - Asnières sur Seine"
4,"Après un disque d'or en 1999 avec ""Forget About It"", Alison Krauss a accumulé de nouveaux succès avec la bande originale du film ""O Brother, Where Are Thou ?"", un album en tête des charts et qui fait beaucoup avancer la cause du bluegrass qui en avait bien besoin après la disparition de Bill Monroe. Cette musique traditionnelle des montagnes du Kentucky ressort de son ghetto grâce à des artistes comme Rhonda Vincent, Dolly Parton ou Alison Krauss qui prennent ainsi le relais d'un groupe comme New Grass Revival, dissous depuis quelques années.Si ""Forget About It"" représente l'aspect le plus contemporain de ce genre musical, ""O Brother"" est à l'opposé l'expression de son penchant le plus traditionnel. Et ""New Favorite"" est un compromis des deux, évoluant des sons les plus rustiques aux mélodies intimistes les plus douces. Dobro, banjo, fiddle et basse acoustique mettent en valeur des complaintes sublimes telles que ""Momma Cried"" qui évoque un grave sujet : le rapt d'un enfant et le déchirement d'une famille. Dan Tyminski en est l'interprète émouvant.""Choktaw Hayride"" est un instrumental qui permet de donner libre cours à la virtuosité des musiciens d'Union Station. ""Stars"" est la reprise d'une mélopée sublime de Dan Fogelberg (1972). ""New Favorite"" est un album fin et racé qui conjugue tradition et modernité."
1,"L'album de Sting est à l'image de ses concerts: plein de bonnes idées, mais super molasson. Ce type a incontestablement du talent, mais se contente de nous servir une soupe aseptisée pour bande FM. Du statut de rocker international, Sting devient un chanteur de ""easy-listening"". L'album aurait pu être intéressant, mais il s'avère trop prévisible et manque de chaleur. Dommage..."
1,"J'ai depuis quelques jours le nouveau Manson... que dire devant tant de décéption... non que les chansons soient mauvaises, mais... ce n'est plus Manson... Sans parler du concert à Toulon hier soir... (1h30 montre en main et d'un chiant à mourir... aucun dialogue avec le public... rien). Mais bon les sirènes du pognon sont impénétrables."
5,"Je viens de decouvrir ce groupe et sincerement... j'adore ;) essaiyez, ca redonne vraiment la peche! mdr"
1,"Soyons clair ce disque n'a rien à faire dans la rubrique du rock progressif, c'est le plus mauvais de GENESIS qui depuis 1977 n'avait plus rien à dire. Le groupe n'existe plus tant mieux."
1,"quand ce disque est sorti, hervé picart, de ""best"", l'avait encensé. je l'avait donc acheté, me fiant au bon gout du critique. je l'ai immédiatement détesté. rien que des chansons pop d'une fadeur affigeante, avec un phil collins encore plus mièvre que d'habitude, c'est dire. pour écrire ce com. j'ai donc réécouté ""invisible touch"" et mon avis n'a pas changé. 1 seul morceau peut être sauvé de ce naufrage: ""brazilian"". pour le reste.... je me suis fait dire que l'album qui est sorti après  était encore plus mauvais, je ne sais pas je ne l'ai jamais écouté, mais ça me parait difficile de faire pire que cette soupe insipide"
1,"Soyons clair ce disque n'a rien à faire dans la rubrique du rock progressif, c'est le plus mauvais de GENESIS qui depuis 1977 n'avait plus rien à dire. Le groupe n'existe plus tant mieux."
2,"Je suis déçu par le nouvel album de Metallica. Certes, il est bien meilleur que l'indigne 'St Anger' mais il ne propose aucune nouveauté,aucune originalité qui caractérisait l'écoute des albums des années 80 avec le Black album. Ce disque est une succession de morceaux qui reprennent avec moins d'inspiration la recette des morceaux du passé. Le morceau 'The day that never comes' en est un parfait exemple, c'est exactement la même structure et la même progression que le chef d'oeuvre 'One'. J'ai beau réécouté l'album mais je n'arrive pas à accrocher et c'est même l'ennui qui s'installe. Metallica est un formidable groupe de scène et peut-être que ces nouveaux morceaux prendront une autre dimension en concert."
2,"Metallica avait atteint sa maturité avec le black album.Un album enfin écoutable par tous, tout en étant gorgé d'émotions , de puissance, sans brader leur style unique.Puis ils sont allés trop loin dans l'écoutable pour devenir banal avec load et reload , puis ... st angel inaudible , puis Death Magnetic. Je ne sais pas pourquoi j'attendais beaucoup de cet album.Mais  non la suite du black album  n'aura pas lieu .Ce nouvel album retombe dans les excés des premiers albums, sans la foi , sans la ferveur , juste une mécanique métallique . Dommage. Le black album  fut-il un accident ? Il semblerait que  oui."
1,"j'ai failli m'endormir à l'écoute de cet ""effort"" : on est loin du compte. stop, arrêtez tout les enfants, c'est ignoble à supporter."
5,"""Suite logique"" de son E.P ""Eyes Closed"", ""Muted"" marque un tournant dans la carrière de Brendon Whitney, aka Alias. Celui que l'on a connu MC virulent lache son micro et se lance dans des compositions plus ""abstract"", avec des ambiances sonores dignes de Boards of Canada ou Aphex Twin. De cet album se dégage une certaine mélancolie, de part ses sons ""froids"" et ses arrangements précis. Une mélancolie qui ne manquera pas, à coup sur,de séduire l'amatteur... Avec commes points d'orgue le featuring de Markus Acher (The Notwist) ""unseen sights"" et le merveilleux ""lost friend advice"", Muted est une très très belle réussite. Un petit diamant pur."
2,"C'est l'album de la consécration pour Graham Coxon. En effet, salué par la critique, il permet enfin à celui-ci d'être reconnu comme un des plus grands musiciens de sa génération. Grande admiratrice du guitariste, j'attendais beaucoup de cet album après l'excellent « The kiss of morning » où le sieur Coxon déployait tout son talent d'auteur compositeur mélodiste. Et là, je ne peux cacher ma déception : ce ne sont que morceaux pop rock efficaces mais un peu trop lisses voire convenus. Graham nous avait habitué à plus d'originalité et d'audace. Quelques titres ont toutefois retenu mon attention comme« People of the earth » et « Are you ready ». Vocalement, Graham a gagné en justesse même s'il a, selon moi, perdu ce côté touchant que lui conférait une voix à la limite de la fausseté. Ce qui n'a pas changé, en revanche, c'est qu'il reste un multi instrumentiste épatant. En conclusion, vivement le prochain album !"
5,La compilation est excellente.On accroche à tous les morceaux dès la 1ère écoute.A écouter sans modération pour tous les amateurs du genre et ceux qui aiment la bonne musique.
5,"Ce programme évoque la célébration d'une nuit de Noël au XVIII° Siècle. Organisés selon le cadre liturgique, les chants polyphoniques à quatre parties de la ""Misas pro tempore Nativitatis Domini"" de Sébastien de Brossard sont inspirés des mélodies traditionnellement associées à la circonstance (« Laissez paistre vos bêtes », « Où s'en vont ces gais bergers », « A minuit fut fait un réveil »...) et alternent avec des Noëls pour orgue solo composés par les spécialistes du genre (Lebègue, Dandrieu, Daquin, Balbastre). Capté en juillet et septembre 1995 en l'Abbaye de Saint-Michel-en-Thiérache, cet enregistrement fut la première réalisation discographique du Parlement de musique fondé par Martin Gester cinq années auparavant. Ce dernier assure ici la direction vocale du groupe et tient les parties solistes du clavier. Et cela avec sensibilité, virtuosité, invention (la superbe improvisation liminaire sur les anches des grands-jeux !) et une réjouissante faconde qui savent nous attendrir avec ces relances de cornets en écho et ces pépiements de larigot. On ne se lasse pas de cette sortie enthousiaste sur les variations « Votre bonté grand Dieu », qui emplit le coeur d'une joie émerveillée ! Les luxuriantes sonorités de l'instrument thiérachois sont les plus rustiques qu'on puisse souhaiter pour illustrer ces vignettes de crèche immémorialement émanées de nos terroirs."
4,"Bon cinq étoiles pour Magnification, faut pas pousser quand même!Vous en mettez combien pour ""Close to the Edge"" ou ""Relayer"",dix, quinze?       D'ailleurs ,si c'était le chef-d'oeuvre escompté,les membres de Yes s'en seraient peut-être rendu compte et n'auraient pas sacrifié l'album à un orchestre.       Disons trois étoiles pour les compositions et quatre pour l'originalité.On peut admettre que l'orchestre amène quelque chose de nouveau ,mais il ne remplace pas les claviers et un peu plus de piano   n'aurait pas fait de mal.       Dire que les musiciens sont exceptionnels,Chris Squire super bassiste, Jon Anderson super voix,etc...là on enfonce les portes ouvertes,on le sait depuis belle lurette!       Magnification qui commence l'album rappelle un peu Time and a word au niveau sonorité mais cela tourne un peu en rond autour d'un ou deux accords et le savoir- faire de Yes contribue grandement à cacher la pauvreté harmonique de l'ensemble.       Dans Spirit of survival,une chose marrante: l'orchestre classique copie le style de jeu des samplers des années 80 qui eux mêmes copiaient le son des orchestres classiques...La boucle est bouclée,que le temps passe...        Il y a quand même un genre de synthé dans Don't go , gentille sucrerie Andersonienne et l'intro de Give love each day est en forme d'hommage à Stravinsky.        J'ai trouvé aussi que Steve Howe était un peu trop confiné aux intros à la guitare accoustique et qu'il était relativement sous employé tout au long de l'album.       Malgré ces petites critiques,l'écoute de l'album est quand même très agréable.Mais ce n'est pas pour autant le grand frisson et je pense que l'hypothétique chef-d'oeuvre tant attendu n'arrivera (hélas) certainement jamais.       Une dernière petite chose qui fâche: pourquoi un album qui s'appelle ""Magnification"" est-il affublé d'une aussi horrible pochette? Roger Dean est-il devenu trop cher pour Yes?"
4,"1er album solo d'un illustre inconnu en 1988, ce festival de Shredding a mis tout le monde d'accord : on pouvait intégrer des chorus déments dans des compos avec de vraies mélodies. Immédiatement, Howe s'est forgé un style, mais ses autres albums n'atteindront pas ce degré de savoir-faire mélodique. Son jeu de guitare est directement influencé par Van Halen et Satriani, avec un très gros feeling, mais aujourd'hui, (près de 15 ans après) on peut dire que Howe est copié par les jeunes ! Tous les titres sont magnifiques, et seul ""Bad Racket"" est un festival de vitesse qui donne envie de ranger sa guitare une fois pour toutes. Que Greg Howe n'ait pas rejoint les grands de la guitare instrumentale est une grande injustice..."
5,"La première fois que j'ai écouté ce CD, j'ai été surpris, la seconde fois et toutes les autres complètement emballé. Vous aimez le jazz, vous ne détestez pas l'école dite de Canterbury par exemple, la bonne pop music ne vous déplait pas? Finalement ce CD est fait pour vous. Vous découvrirez que sous ses faux airs de minimalisme, cette musique cache une grande subtilité...Que du bonheur pour vos oreilles."
2,"Faute à une bonne production et à un enregistrement précipité, ce second album de Kiss n'est pas encore à la hauteur malgré de très bons titres tels Hotter Than Hell / Got To Choose / Strange Ways / Watching You / Parasite. Dressed To Kill qui suivra quelques mois plus tard réhaussera le niveau (meilleure production) mais c'est surtout sur scène avec l'album ALIVE! que les compositions tranchantes du groupe prendront toute leur saveur."
4,"oui si on regarde il semble que tout soit là: la playlist est parfaite, le meilleur de Thin Lizzy et le tout en live... mais car il y a un mais: malgré Scott Gorham (membre des débuts) John Sykes et Darren Wharton (présents uniquement sur les 2 derniers albums) il manque Brian Downey, le batteur originel de Thin Lizzy, celui qui donnait un swing si particulier aux titres composés par Phil Lynott... si vous connaissez Thin Lizzy c'est un bon investissement, sinon jetez vous plutot sur ""Live and dangerous"" !!!"
5,"Rush est un groupe de rock progressif comme on en fait plus. Au cours de leurs 30 ans de carrière, après 18 albums studio et 4 lives, j'attendais fébrilement en tant que fan du trio canadien, le nouvel album depuis le fabuleux "" test for echo "" qui date de 1996! Si vous aimez la technique au service de la mélodie, et vice et versa, alors cet album vous ravira ! si vous n'êtes pas un fan et même si vous ne connaissez pas ce groupe, cet album vous en dira long sur le ce que sont capable de faire trois musiciens de génie. Bien sûr je ne suis pas très objectif, mais si vous avez un disque à acheter je vous le conseil vivement, si vous pensez que le rock est mort et qu'il a cédé sa place, cet album vous fera certainement changer d'avis !  Enfin si vous êtes un batteur, un guitariste ou un bassiste en mal d'inspiration, vous avez trouvez votre bonheur !"
2,"Il était conquérant, et avec cet album, il ne devient qu'un simple soldat de la musique électro. Ce disque contient quelques bons moments (les mouvements II, III et IV), mais c'est un manque d'inspiration flagrant qui caractérise ce disque. Mention spéciale à Patrick Rondat, guitariste français et homme délicieux (j'ai eu la chance de pouvoir m'entretenir avec lui durant 45 minutes, c'est un vrai gentleman), qui réhausse le mouvement III de sa présence."
5,"Depuis le temps que certains attendaient ça... Enfin un CD ou seul Liam met ses capacités au service de lui-même. Au point de déplaire à certains, Mr Howlett pose ses influences de n'importe quel bord dans ce mix aussi maîtrisé que puissant. Pour preuve après quelques écoutes, on ne s'en lasse plus. Tranquillou et avec une grande technique il enchaîne une quantité incroyable de titres de tout bord. Que ce soit des vieillerie Funk ou Soul, du Rock anglais, du vieux Hip-Hop américain, du break-beat anglais ou américain etc... Tout ce qui a fait la génèse du son Prodigy ( entendez par là le son à partir du deuxième album...). Les titres s'enchaînent avec une grande cohérance, notez par exemple qu'enchaîner les Beastie Boys et Barry Withe ou les Sex Pistols avec Fat Boy Slim devient d'une évidente facilité avec lui.  Un disque qui fait vraiment du bien à entendre et qui met en avant les racines Old-School de l'ex B-Boy... Indispensable pour les non-allergiques au vieux son."
4,"un bon achat! mention spéciale pour Burst Générator, un morceau booster dont je ne me lasse pas."
5,"Un son folk rock tout simplement sublime et même ponctuellement innovant. Tantôt rauque et ""Nirvanesque"" (""Mangolia Mountain""), tantôt aigüe et épurée (un soupçon de Simon &amp; Garfunkel, voir ""Meadowlake Street""), la voix guide la mélodie avec une aisance confondante, brillamment soutenue par des guitares exceptionnellement bien mixées (du niveau des derniers albums de Johnny Cash). Foncez !"
5,"1976, les années 70, l'âge d'or de la musique Kraut Rock qui va progressivement se muer en musique électronique de moins en moins planante et de plus en plus cérébrale. Manuel Göttsching, est un génial musicien de musique électronique et expérimentale, co-fondateur avec Klaus Schulze et Hartmut Enke du groupe Ash Ra Tempel. Dans un registre beaucoup plus enlevé et enthousiaste que son compatriote Klaus Schulze, il nous délivre un petit bijou à l'ambiance si particulière et poétique. ""Sunrain"" qui est à la fois aérien et enthousiasmant montre bien que la musique électronique n'est pas qu'un trip pour mélomanes sous prozac."
5,"je résumerais ainsi ce nouvel album que nous offre Prince. pas besoin de connaître toute son oeuvre pour se laisser embarquer dans les nouveaux morceaux de ce musicien hors pair comme sur un navire captivant. il entraine, émeut, surpend, mais il ne laisse jamais indifférent et surtout il confirme le talent incomparable de Prince. le disque est comme un livre qui s'écoute de la première à la dernière note, mon moment préféré de cette histoire est sans doute la conclusion avec le somptueux et très long titre ""Last december"" qui est à l'image de tout l'album, tantôt jazz, tantôt funk, rock ou gospel, mais toujours, toujours la classe..."
4,"strycly for my niggaz second album de 2pac et deja des textes tres engager puisque cet album fut retirer de la vente nottamment pour les chansons""holler  if ya hear me et souljahs revenge"" qui prone la violence envers la police meme le vise president des etats unis a l'epoque dan quayle se fait insulter c vous dire a quel point cet album a choque l'opinion publique quoique qu'il en  soit tres bon album avec les bombes ""holler if ya hear me,souljah revenge,last world avec ice t et ice cube en featuring,the streetz r deathrow,papa'z song,representin 93,i get around et le magnifique keep ya head up album a se procurer d'urgence................"
1,Voilà encore un album fait pour se faire de l'argent en profitant du film pour nous refourguer des musiques rock pas forcément toutes nouvelles...Pourquoi Warner n'ont-ils pas sorti le score (la musique composée pour le film par Christopher Young) en album ???
5,"Je tiens a dire aus blaireaus qui croient connaitre le rap ricain qu'eminem n'a ni fais 3 ou 4 albums mais 5: Infinite, the slim shady ep et lp, the mm lp et enfin the eminem show. ce dernier album est bien different des autres car oui eminem chante. Ces beats sont sensas et les featurings toujours aussi cool. without me n'est pas la seule chanson bien comme beaucoup le pense il faudrait ecouter les autres!!! toutes les musiques sont differents des autres albums et vous devriez essayer de trouver les 150 au moins feat d'em pour pouvoir comparer. La plupart des gens n'en connaissent que 2 the real slim shady et without me alors acheter les cds et eclater vous les oreilles car em c de la bombe. ne critiquez pas c 1000 fois mieux que le rap francais ou ils disent tout le temps la meme chose ........... Eminem a su se faire un nom grace a dre et produit de nombreux rappers comme obie trice, d12 et royce da 5-9. Alors respect a lui et aux autres achetez eminem show et apprenez a le comprendre. Il est loin d'etre nul et c certainement le plus réaliste venant de lui. Eminem show you're the best"
1,"Franchement je ne comprends pas trop cet engouement pour Avril Lavigne. Qu'elle soit différente des Britney et des Christina n'en fait pas un génie pour autant... Ce disque ressemble vaguement à une pâle copie d'Alanis Morissette mixée avec du Sheryl Crow. Et quand on mixe du pur son, le résultat n'est pas forcément aussi bon. Miss Lavigne se la joue rebelle, certes, on pourrait croire qu'avec sa gratte et son pseudo look street c'est une surdouée. Il en est tout autrement. Finalement quand on veut faire de l'anti Britney on en vient toujours à faire encore plus commercial qu'elle."
4,"une vraie bombe atomique que cet album produit par des pointures: q.tip, bomb squad (le son de public enemy)-qui signe LA bastosse ""oooh whatcha gonna do""- et pete rock. avec des featurings d'artistes typiquement ""early 90's"": pete rock, q.tip (a tribe called quest), onyx, jam master jay au chant. fini le son old school minimaliste 80's qui faisait la réputation justifiée du posse; du son vraiment dans l'air du temps, hardcore au possible: run dmc en très grande forme."
5,"C'est l'album qui a vraiment révélé IAM, car leur premier n'avait pas encore été trop écouté au moment où le rap décollait en France. Là, ça bouillonne, ça pète, comme à la création de l'univers. Le nombre de samples utilisés est incroyable, et offre une richesse musicale qui ferait taire bien des détracteurs du rap (si seulement ils en écoutaient avant de critiquer). Les sujets couverts sont tantôt sérieux, tantôt humoristiques, et ce sont ces derniers que je préfère : ""Harley Davidson"", ""Attentat II"", ""Le repos c'est la santé""... la démonstration est faite qu'il n'y a pas besoin de grosses beatboxes, ni de scander les lyrics pour faire passer un message. IAM démontrent en tout cas qu'ils maîtrisent toutes les dimensions de leur art. Un incontournable."
5,"si vous n'en avez qu'un, cela pourrait être celui-ci. On retrouve toute la simplicité des accords et de ""dédé"" la boite à rythme qui font toute l'originalité de ce groupe dans un mouvement punk musicalement plutôt brouillon. Cela permet de percevoir la clarté des textes et c'est un vrai régal. Ce CD résume toute l'ambiance Béru studio, qui, bien sûr est trés différente des ""lives"", mais comparons ce qui est comparable.On a vraiment le sentiment d'être à la ""source"" des béruriers, d'autant plus que l'on est gratifié de 4 enregistrements inédits de la plus pure origine."
5,"du bonheur a l'etat pur de réécouter ces standards américains interprétés par ce crooner de charme, qui savait si bien les mettre en valeur !!!"
1,"Autant Def Lep mérite le respect pour ses deux premiers albums, ""On Through The Night"", ""Hit &amp; Run"", qui sans apporter réellement quelque chose au genre, étaient suffisamment bien foutus pour le renouveler, autant, ici, sur ce ""Hysteria"", je dis : STOP THE MADNESS ! La production de cet album est tellement ""parfaite"", le son est tellement ""énorme"" que ce n'en est, pour moi, même plus de la musique, en tout cas plus du rock : Où est l'énergie, l'urgence, le ""pousse-toi-d'ici-que-je-m'y-mette"" qui caractérise le rock, et qui plus est le hard rock ? On est juste dans une démonstration de producteur qui, en surboostant le son du Def Lep, lui a fait perdre son âme. C'est d'autant plus dommage qu'il y a des mélodies et des riffs accrocheurs (""Gods Of War""), mais c'est, en ce qui me concerne, impossible à écouter : j'ai l'impression d'être dans une espèce de dimension high-tech où tout serait joli-beau-carré . . . attractif au début, puis écoeurant au bout de 5 mn. Ecoeurant jusqu'à la nausée."
4,J'ai retrouvé avec joie un groupe qui avait marqué son temps et que beaucoup de jeunes devraient découvrir.
4,"Après cinq fabuleux albums: (Creedence Clearwater Revival, Bayou Country, Green River, Willy and the Poor Boys et le génial Cosmo's Factory), John Fogerty innove un peu pour ce sixième album (six en trois ans, un record).  En effet, il introduit dans ces morceaux, orgue, piano et saxo. Mes préférés sont ""Green river"" et ""Cosmo's Factory"" mais ""Pendulum"" qui hélas sera le dernier mis à part ""Mardi Gras"" qui est en deça (peut être l'absence de Tom Fogerty) nous donne quelques perles. Ecoutez l'intro de ""Pagan Baby"", le hit ""Hey Tonight"" ou encore la nostalgie et le blues de ""Have You Ever Seen the Rain"" et vous comprendrez pourquoi j'aime ce disque. Un excellent Creedence, un peu effacé par les albums précédents. Je conseille vivement ""Pendulum""."
5,"ce disque est une merveille de musicalité et d'humilité. j'ai eu le privilège d'assister à la naissance du groupe, à l'amphi de l'Opéra de Lyon, le choc fut ""terrible"" que de découvrir live ces 2 chanteuses qui ont su chacune avec leur amour mettre leur voix au service de David, un bijour que ce disque... URGENTISSIME découvrez Maria et Fay"
5,"un peu déroutant au départ,mais on y revient  volontiers et la  magie opère alors: superbe interaction entre les  musiciens, pate sonore bouillonante, esquisses de  mélodies, saturations déchirantes, avec un petit quelquechose de féminin...en plus, elle est jolie!"
5,"Depuis combien de temps attendais-je ce disque? Toujours indisponible car non réédité depuis bien longtemps, ou parfois présent sur des sites japonais à des prix faramineux (sans compté le port excessivement onéreux). Impulse se décide enfin à ressortir ce qui a été le dernier disque enregistré par Pharoah Sanders pour le label et dans un superbe packaging, qui plus est! Sur les cinq titres, quatre proviennent d'un enregistrement de concerts donnés au Ash Grove (club de Los Angeles) les 7 et 9 septembre 1973. Autant dire qu'il doit rester un matériel considérable qui n'a pas été encore édité : il est bien évident que la formation conduite par Sanders (dix musiciens) n'a pas joué que 4 compositions en deux concerts. Un titre a été enregistré en studio (""Greeting to saud"") le 13 septembre à San Fransisco.  Le nombre de musiciens qui interviennent aux percussions (sept) indique la tonalité musicale de l'album : rythmique foisonnante. Sanders se montre puissant, inventif, à la fois sereinement lyrique et incendiaire. La musique proposée ici se situe dans le prolongement des albums studio (""Black unity"", ""Jewels of tought""). ""Elevation"" (le titre) et ""the Gathering"" relève du Free tel que le pensait alors Pharoah : teinté de stridences mais aussi d'une spiritualité apaisée et d'une ouverture aux musiques du monde.  L'attente est finalement bien récompensée tant ce disque est superbe. Il ne reste plus qu'à espérer que sortent un jour tous les autres morceaux enregistrés ces 7 et 9 septembre 1973... Ils doivent être nombreux!"
5,"Pour tous ceux qui ont dans l'oreille ce merveilleux album de Coltrane intitulé « Ballads » le disque de Pharoah Sanders sonne, de la première à la dernière note, comme un hommage vibrant. L'empathie est parfois troublante (surtout quand il joue du soprano « I Want to Talk about You »). Mais notre homme évite tout pastiche et paraphrase.  La rythmique est, certes, bien loin des chatoiements, des profondeurs et des remous de la triade McCoy Tyner/Jimmy Garisson/Elvin Jones, mais l'ensemble de l'interprétation, tout en retenue, reste homogène. Un petit reproche, toutefois, à mon sens les improvisation de Pharoah Sanders ne sont peut-être pas assez développées. L'accent est mis plutôt sur l'exposition des thèmes, qu'il joue, mais est-il besoin d'y insister ? admirablement. Un magnifique disque. Serein, émouvant et fervent. Welcome to Love."
2,"Ce ""Somewhere back in time"" se voulant comme une initiation d'un nouveau public à ce qu'est et fut la Vierge de Fer, Steve Harris a allégrement mélangé les morceaux allant de ""Iron Maiden"" à ""Seventh son of a Seventh son"" sans respecter une quelconque chronologie. C'est là une grande erreur, le groupe ayant évolué au fil des années d'un style rappelant le punk vers des compositions de plus en plus grandiloquentes et progressives. ""Killers"" est d'ailleurs totalement sous-représenté, alors que c'est une pièce majeur de la NWOBHM. Si les sempiternels ""the evil that men do"" et ""can I play with madness"" auraient pu être évités, on retrouve quand même de très bons morceaux, comme ""phantom of the opera"", ""2 minutes to midnight"" ou encore ""powerslave"". Une compilation à ne reserver qu'aux néophytes du groupe anglais."
2,"Hormis la splendide pochette qui est une attraction à elle toute seule, il est difficile de justifier une telle compilation : parfaitement incomplète, servant à peine à dire que le groupe joue une tournée nostalgique couvrant la période 1984-1988... Il est parfois bien difficile de défendre Iron Maiden, malgré la qualité des compositions en présence. Prendre le fan pour une vache à lait, à l'époque du p2p, est-ce bien nécessaire (et en phase avec son époque)? Pour le puriste, l'achat ne se fera pas. Le collectionneur sera ravi d'avoir un nouveau visuel fort réussi. Pour le béotien, je lui conseille plutôt l'achat de tous les albums. C'est un peu coûteux mais des groupes comme celui-ci ne peuvent (et ne doivent) être résumés de la sorte."
5,"Van Der graaf qui est enfin redevenu Generator nous fait une magnifique Offrande.. Même si les morceaux ne sont pas très différents de originaux, il s'agit là d'un témoignage live majeur d'un des plus grand groupe de prog qui plaira assurément à tous les fans, et par son côté ""best of""(ceci dit tous les morceaux du groupe sont des best of...) saura convertir ceux qui ne connaissent pas; La prise de son est exceptionnelle et rend enfin hommage à toute la subtilité du jeu de Evans, ce qui n'était pas le cas dans Vital. VDGG ; violence, poésie, puissance, mystère......."
5,"Un album fabuleux, des textes morbides à souhait  portés par des mélodies envoûtantes. Son plus bel album."
2,"Et bien, fidèle de Depeche Mode, je dois dire que je suis extremement déçu... Le travail réalisé sur cette 'mise à jour' est orientée techno (rythme revenant tout le temps). Peu de recherche musical et lorsqu'on entend un petit rytme de symphonie, les boom boom reviennent tout fracasser... J'ai l'impression qu'il a fallut faire ces CD à la rache pour noel... Pas une réussite."
2,"A quand un chanteur et un producteur digne de ce nom en France. Ce disque est d'une fadeur terrible, le chant est étouffé, les guitares trop saturés et la batterie, on dirait un tambourin. Annoncé comme le leader de la scéne métal française, Pleymo m'a déçu pourtant et comme pour beaucoup de groupe français il ne manque pas grand chose (un chanteur et de l'argent pour une grosse production). Peut être pour la prochaine fois"
1,Hybrid Théory était fantastique... Meteora n'en est qu'une pâle copie... A quand l'évolution?
5,"Avec ce nouvel opus, Muriel Moreno nous apporte sa vision indispensable de la musique électronique en brassant tous les genres, et en créant un univers mélancolique, joyeux, oubliant la parole pour se consacrer davantage à l'émotivité de sa musique."
2,"L'empereur de la six (ou sept) cordes se laisserait-il aller a quelque derive mercantile? En reprenant les septiemes titres de tous ces precedents albums, Steve Vai recycle a peu de frais ses anciennes productions. On se decroche quand meme toujours la machoire sur certaines performances techniques et melodiques en se rappelant que, oui, Vai a bien ete un sacre precurseur de la guitare electrique. Pour le reste que les fans passent leur chemin, les inedits ne sont pas tres inspires. Pour les autres, cet album peut etre un bon moyen de rentrer dans l'univers de l'Alien, sans plus. Mieux vaut encore craquer pour ""Passion and Warfare"", un des premiers albums du maitre."
2,"Loin le temps où les Scorpions se déchainaient sur scène à en faire exploser les projecteurs... Depuis plusieurs années, le groupe de Klaus Meine se complait dans les pures ballades rock, et les sons hard rock restent difficiles à capturer... Ce live enregistré en Espagne a une résonnance de flamenco avec la version accoustique de Holiday, et les autres sont des ballades, malgré tout assez réussies comme Love of my life, très ""Scorpions"" 2001... mais ceux qui sont à la recherche d'un retour au bon hard rock seront déçus et reconnaitront qu'il est sage de classer ce Cd dans la catégorie Hard FM..."
2,"Très honnêtement, ce all stars band aux allures mirifiques, formé d'ex-Guns et ex-STP, promettait monts et merveilles, et loin d'attendre un rock du calibre de Guns'n'roses, on pouvait tout de même espérer une forte inspiration née du choc de ces titans et donc une flopée de titres accrocheurs aux mélodies ravageuses avec forces guitares, etc. Alors qu'en est-il réellement ? Ceux qui adulent ce groupe ne peuvent pas être objectifs, car bien que les guitares soient présentes et même très rentre-dedans, l'ensemble souffre d'un certain manque de cette inspiration tant attendue. A l'image d'un Slash's Snakepit en forme de demi-molle, on retrouve sur ""Contraband"" une réelle envie d'en découdre, mais pas les moyens pour le faire. Et l'on comprend alors que les compositeurs de Guns n'étaient pas ceux qui jouent dans ce Velvet Revolver, même s'ils restent des musiciens hors-normes. L'inspiration, on l'a ou ne l'a pas. Et ici elle fait défaut. On ne peut pas détester un titre d'ouverture comme ""Sucker Train Blues"", ou comme ""Big Machine"", qui sont efficaces, mais on essaye inconsciemment de se persuader qu'ils sont des tueries, rien que parce que Slash et consorts les exécute, alors que c'est FAUX. Ce sont de bons titres rocks... comme il y en existe des milliers. Je dirais même que pas un seul titre sur ce disque ne pourrait se positionner en qualité de tube imparrable. Jamais on entends un riff ou un refrain mortel qui est la marque des grands, le marque du génie, du talent, un morceau qui relève tout un disque, qui vous fait penser que seul cette chanson vaut le coup d'acheter le disque. Ce serait polutôt l'inverse : la somme poussive de tous ces titres moyennement inspirés fait que peut-être ça vaudrait le coup de dégotter ce CD à moitié-prix. Alors ce manque de personnalité est bien entendu palié par une production monstrueuse, un son superbe, une interprétation puissante, ça tape et ça gratte à tout va, ça déménage... mais un steak pas tendre reste un steak pas tendre même avec les meilleures sauces du monde et tous les accompagnements que l'on veut. Je veux bien croire que les parties en présence se sont éclatées à faire ce disque, à jammer, à composer, mais je ne pense pas que leur objectif ait jamais été ni de révolutionner le style, ni d'y apporter quoi que ce soit. Ce disque n'est pas indispensable, c'est juste un disque rock puissant de plus... un peu transparent. L'on retrouvera d'ailleurs les mêmes caractéristiques sur ""Libertad"", 2ème opus du gang... J'ai donc mis 2 étoiles au lieu des 3 de départ, car d'une telle brochette de tueurs on était en droit légitime d'attendre beaucoup mieux."
1,"Cet album peut se resumer assez facilement: une intro de guitare, accordee tres bas pour donner plus de peche a des riffs sans imagination, la batterie qui rentre, puis la suite, ennuyeuse, avec des couplets a peine chantes. Tout se ressemble, rien ne se distingue, a part la tres bonne chanson qui a donne son titre a l'album, et qui est l'unique satisfaction (meme la pochette est a vomir). Mention particuliere au son de caisse claire, qui sonne tellement comme une casserole qu'on la croirait empruntee a Maite. Dommage que Metallica finisse comme ca."

1,"metallica annonce un retour au metal rentre-dedans-celui qui lui a donné ses lettres de noblesse-mais se fourvoie dans une repompe neo metal au moment où ce genre marque le pas! metallica, qui a parfois innové mais surtout sorti des compos intemporelles au point d'être le chef de file du mouvement metal au sens generique du terme, est avec st anger, à la traîne.  fini la tête de peloton, metallica n'a plus d'inspiration: sous couvert d'expérimentations et de recherche d'un nouveau souffle, le groupe se contente de bourriner sans conviction des morceaux sans saveur et tourne en rond 75mn durant. les nouveaux titres sont trop longs, avec des riffs moyens et mal agencés, le chant est bancal et l'option zero solo est catastrophique dans le cadre de chansons qui dépassent les 6-7 mn sans que l'intéret ne décolle. se passer des talents de l'un des meilleurs solistes metal au monde, c'est se tirer une balle dans le pied, sauf si les riffs tenaient la route à eux seuls, mais ce n'est hélas plus le cas désormais! peut-être qu'avec un peu de recul, metallica se serait rendu compte que ce disque est terriblement banal et dispensable et ne l'aurait pas sorti. maintenant pour redresser la barre, ils leur faut arrêter de se regarder le nombril et se sortir les doigts du cul...si c'est encore possible!"
5,"un vrai bonheur en ecoutant cet album, funk disco saoul et cette reprise de Barry White;Magnifique et on a envie de danser en l'ecoutant, du bonheur à l'état pur!!!"
5,Il est PHENOMENAL!!!! c'est clair! Au niveau son il tranche radicalement avec les autres BrandX (qui sont tous excelents soit dit en passant)...Les claviers sont un peu moins étouffants et les transpositions studio/live transandent litteralement les compos (Malaga Virgen) et les impros sont exceptionnelles (Isis Mourning). A essayer absolument!!! Surtout si vous ne connaissait pas BrandX!!
5,"Du lour de chez lourd : Chemical Brothers et leur excellent Galvanize (push the button !), Thievery Corporation et une version longue, voire ennivrante, en tout cas géniale du Heart is a lonely hunter (welcome to my spaceship / she's beautiful for ever/ she's right here where you left her / the heart's lonely hunter), Tahiti 80... et bien sûr K-Os avec son Man I used to be. Un morceau qui vous fera groover toute la journée si vous l'écoutez le matin !"
1,"Je trouve ce disque très mauvais , dans la lignée de la période post-disco , cela sonne comme du mauvais Genesis période prétentieuse Phil Collins. On est loin des débuts avec le Spencer Davis group , de Blind Faith et Traffic. Le mieux c'est le dernier live avec Clapton pour apprécier un Stevie retrouvé. On ne peut lui reprocher, chaque artiste passe par des périodes de recherches , d'errements , soumis à la pression commerciale qui fait qu'il faut produire pour durer et pouvoir rebondir. Mais pour moi c'est un disque que j'écoute une fois et basta. Pour conclure je dirais qu'un artiste n'est jamais meilleur que lorsqu'il reste dans ce qu'il fait de mieux , voir Bob Dylan , Neil Young , Eric Clapton mais  que cela , ils le découvrent aussi eux-mêmes en s'égarant parfois. C'est le lot de chacun."
5,"Un chanteur qui met la country au service de sa foi!! Excellent, à écouter encore et encore..."
4,"Pourquoi je dis ""très bon best of de In Flames"" alors que c'est un ""live. Tout simplement car on entends rien de la réaction du public, et que les versions des musiques sont vraiment très proche de ceux du studio, a part pour ""Scorn"" et ""Clay Man"". Le fait que le public ne réagisse pas (ou j'ai entendu qu'ils avaient gommé le bruit du public), ça nous donne l'impression que ce sont des musiques enregistrés dans un studio parfois. Et très bon best of , car les meilleures musiques de la période Old-School est là! Même si j'aurais préféré un ""Artifacts of The Black Rain"" ou un ""The Jester Race"" a la place de ""Moonshield"", c'est quand même une sacrée Setlist !  ""Bullet Ride"" pour commencer, c'est dévastateur! Quel riff nom de dieu ! Suivi de deux titres ravageurs comme ""Embody The Invisible"" et ""Jotun, et bien l'ambiance est mise , même si on ne l'entends pas. On sait a qui on a à faire. ""Clay Man"" est bien foutue, ""Only For The Weak"" beaucoup mieux que la version studio, ""Ordinary Story"" toujours aussi belle que dans l'album, j'aime beaucoup cette version, la voix de Anders est carrément pas la même quand même ! ""Colony"" vraiment Waw ! Elle donne la pêche celle là puis finir avec un bon vieux ""Episode 666"". Les musiques que je retiendrais le plus dans cet album ça serait surtout : -Gyroscope -Ordinary Story -Jotun IN FLAMES WE TRUST!"
1,"Ce disque est tout simplement nul. Rien de plus à dire. Les textes sont faibles, faciles. Dommage."
2,"Kiss est une institution, c'est pas un scoop ! Alors je me suis laissé tenter (avoir). Parce que de Kiss ... Curieusement je ne possédais rien. Lorsqu'on m'annonce (donc) le retour en ""grandes pompes"" (elle est bien bonne) avec le decorum, le maquillage et tout le tralala de ce géant du Hard et bien je me dis que c'est peut être bien là le moment opportun pour enfin découvrir ce que la bande à Gene peut bien avoir de plus que les autres formations du genre. Et patatra ! illico dans le panneau je suis tombé. Alors c'est ça Kiss ? Bob Ezrin, le mouvement rigolo (2 secondes) de son illustration, 3-4 morceaux qui balancent bien ... Ben oui mais ca ne suffit pas à me faire oublier et/ou accepter tout le battage médiatique que certains spécialistes continuent de faire autour de ce groupe de ... Mercenaires. Clownesque ... What else ?  9,5/20"
2,"Eh bien, oui ! Décevant. Et pourtant j'étais jusque-là un inconditionnel. Je ne peux m'empêcher de faire le parallèle avec Radiohead que j'ai d'ailleurs découvert il y a peu suite à la sortie de ""In Rainbows""(eh oui, c'est possible). Je ne trouve pas de surprise dans cet album : des mélodies qui sombrent dans la facilité, des rythmes hyper bateaux, des sons plutôt plats. On est vraiment dans du pur commercial, sans prise de risque, dans le but d'accrocher ceux qui seraient passer à côté de Troubles ou Scientist des albums précédents. Pour ceux qui ne connaîtraient pas, écoutez ""Ok Computer"" et vous comprendrez mes propos. Déjà X&amp;Y pouvait faire craindre ce qui arrive aujourd'hui. Dommage."
1,"Décevant, et pourtant c'est un vieux fan de 42 ans qui parle ou plutôt qui écrit. Cet album marque la fin d'une longue collaboration entre A. Vandenbergh et Coverdale : l'idée est louable, tant d'autre l'ont eue avant, mais l'alchimie ne prend pas, les compos n'ont aucune saveur, la voix n'est plus ce qu'elle était (cf LIVE in the HEART of the CITY), et la plupart des chansons ne se prêtent pas à cette tranformation trop intimiste.Quant aux parties de guitares, elles sentent l'improvisation vite faite, sans réelle harmonie avec la voix. A réserver aux fans (dont je suis).Allez donc vous jeter sur la première période du Serpent Blanc (Ready and Willing, jusqu'à Slide it in : 5 albums essentiels, et indémodables, parole de vieux vieux fan!!)"
2,"David y voulait pas , pi finalement il a dit oui , pourquoi ? . ""Restless heart"" à promouvoir , la pression commercial des pontes du marketing , l'envie de tuer l'temps , ou juste le plaisir d'un nouvel exercice ... On ne le saura pas et c'est sans importance . Toujours est-t-il que le beau blond , soudainement chatain ( l'absence de lumière sans doute ) et les cheveux mi long , nous offre sur ce Live ( Show case plutôt ) acoustique 10 morceaux dépouillés de tous arrangements aussi courts que les ""douilles"" du chanteur . Décidemment tout fout le camp . Si au départ ce type d'exercice pouvait s'avérer tout à fait louable de la part de nos deux duellistes , le résultat s'avère vite d'un ennui mortel . Rien ne décolle vraiment , et seule la petite assemblée présente semble y trouver son compte . On sent que cette parenthèse (pas enchantée du tout) n'a pas été assez préparé de la part du duo . Bâclé si l'on préfère . Il en résulte une interprétation très en deçà de ce que l'on était en droit d'espérer de la part du Ténor . On retiendra quand même que certains standards prennent ici une couleur toute particulière ... C'est la moindre des choses . 7/20"
2,"Et si... et si... smile n'a pas vu le jour en 1967 c'est que tout simplement Wilson s'est rendu compte qu'à part 3 ou 4 titres ses démos d'alors n'arrivaient pas à la cheville de la boulimie artistique des lennon/Mc Cartney et consorts de l'époque. Cette exhumation vénale (et thérapeutique pour Brian Wilson) rend justice à l'histoire de la Pop (il n'y a de chef d'oeuvre que ""Pet Sounds"")et nous encourage à écouter les bootlegs de ""Smile"". Quoi de plus pitoyable que cette voix de petit vieux relayée par un vocoder numérique, on recherche vainement ce qui pourrait remplacer les harmonies de Carl et de Dennis qui transcendaient les autres versions de ""smile"". Finalement, le seul point positif est d'être définitivement fixé sur l'ordre et la séquence des tracks du créateur mais c'est cher payé pour faire disparaître ce qui fut le mythe du ""lost record"". Les seuls ""tracks habités"", comme ""Cabinessence"" ou ""Surf's Up"" sont depuis longtemps enregistrés par les Beach Boys (pas fou les frangins ...)""Good vibrations"" est, comme chacun le sait, bien antérieur à ""Smile"" et le reste n'est que transitions ... Ecouter les versions non officielles de ""smile"", vous n'en reviendrez pas ... là il y avait du génie ... ici vous avez la technique d'un orchestre de mercenaires admiratifs d'exécuter une ""légende"" et une recherche ultime de reconnaissance de fin de vie ... Rest in peace Brian."
5,"De tous les albums ""hors albums classiques du groupe"" ce coffret est le seul qui valle le coup, ce n'est pas un énième best-of qui propose encore et toujours les mêmes chansons (et même pas les meilleures!). Cet album est un bonus, des versions live différentes de celles sur les albums standards! des coup de pipeau de Morrison sur scène en plein concerts) des morceaux introuvables, i.e. Adolph Hitler is alive, I fucked her last night si mes souvenirs sont exacts!!! Bref une édition COLLECTOR si vous êtes fan, en plus des photos magnifiques et des anecdotes dans le livret qui vous est offert en prime... A ne surtout pas rater..."
4,"Ha oui parceque ça hurle sur cette galette ! De belles gueulantes (et de la mélodie aussi bien sur) au service d'un bon heavy très varié, parfois old school 80's, parfois très moderne ou même carrément ballade. Le sieur Bach explore toutes ses influences pour nous offrir un cd riche et assez personnel. Le son est excellent, les musicos le sont encore plus (All star band). Tout n'est pas génial, mais 3 étoiles auraient été un peu juste, alors va pour 4, à défaut de pouvoir mettre 3,5."
5,"C'est simple, cet album résume à lui seul le terme de ""mélodeath"": le mélange de mélodie et d'agressivité est ici parfaitement dosé et composé.Une véritable perle noir, mikael stanne est au summum de son art, les grattes expressives et techniques en diable, l'ambiance tellement géniale qu'il m'est impossible de décrire ce que je ressent à chaque écoute de cet album: c'est pour moi leur meilleur album tout simplement!!!magique!!!!"
1,"Si vous avez déjà les autres albums des sisters, cette complilation ne vous apportera pas grand chose de plus... j'irais même jusqu'à dire qu'elle ne vous apportera strictement rien étant donné que, c'est bien là le principe d'une compilation, chacune des chansons contenues dans cet album peut être retrouvée sur leurs autres albums... Néanmoins, le choix des chanson retrouvées dessus reste une bonne sélection."
5,"Ce 8 ème album de kassav est certainement le premier, après 6 ans de tatonnement et d'expériences musicales, où le zouk a trouvé sa véritable sonorité, sa véritable identité, . Le groupe a enfin trouvé le vrai son du zouk et ce disque ouvre la période de faste du genre musical. Que des bons titres, que des tubes impérissables. A recommander à qui voudrait se frotter au zouk. A posséder absolument si on est fan du genre et de Kassav."
4,"Cet album du groupe suisse de hard-rock offre une palette de titres assez différente (si vous le compares avec les albums suivants) mais c'est ce qui fait son charme: des titres typiquement hard-rock ""Come On"" ou ""Back Seat Rock'n'Roll"" par exemple, d'autres plus lent (""Streamer"") mais SURTOUT ne passer pas à côté de ""Fire"".  Dans la musique en général, je connais peu de titres qui me donnent des frissons dans le dos quand je les écoute. ""Fire"" est à mettre au Panthéon du rock. Cela commence comme toute bonne chanson qui se respecte MAIS après 2 minutes 20, c'est un instrumental qui prend la place...et de la guitare comme ça, c'est purement jouissif: un solo guitare qui va crescendo...A pleurer de bonheur. Je connais peu de morceaux qui arrivent au niveau de ""Fire"". Rien que pour ce titre, cela vaut la peine d'avoir ce disque dans sa collection."
5,"Avec A day at the races, cette autre summum de la musique Pop qu'est A Night at the Opera ( allusion Marx) est tout aussi indispensable. Queen est incontournable et ce CD vaut son pesant d'or musical. C'est tellement vrai que c'est un lieu commun que de le répéter..."
2,"Desole, mais je n'appellerais pas cet album l'album de l'année!(il faudra voir pour du grand metal du cote de Slayer mais bon..) Les riffs de cet album sont du copier-coller de Morbid Angel, Cannibal Corpse et autres Nile et le batteur ne fait plus que du blast beat en essayant d'imiter de tres bons batteurs. Bref,on notera quand meme un bon son,et qques bonnes idees sur qques chansons(people=shit,the shape,heretic anthem ou skin ticket) mais guere plus car ces messieurs de slipknot ne brillent pas par leur originalite! Bref,beaucoup de bruit pour rien."
4,Un bonne album inférieur a diclamer 2.Des morceaux comme never leave ou encore given retiendront particulièrement l'attention.
2,"Cet album qui est le companion d'un show télévisé de Streisand dans les années 70, n'aurait jamais du être édité. Il est vrai que l'idée d'orchestrer les chansons de Barbra dans différents styles (africain, espagnol, japonnais) est à la base une bonne idée. Mais helas si le show TV est une réussite visuelle, l'album quand a lui est quasiment insuportable. Barbra bien que vocalement tres ne forme à du mal a se faire entendre parmi les bruits de machines a laver, d'aspirateurs, de téléphones qui accompagnent certaines chansons. Un brouhaha sauvé tant bien que mal par une Barbra vocalement tres en forme ! Par contre le show mérite (lui) d'être vu !"
2,"cette edition n'est pas la veritable de 1981 que je possede ne vynil, le titre HARDEN MY HEART ets remplacé par ABRACADABRA"
2,"Effectivement sa majesté ""Dandy Premier"" n'a pas pris beaucoup de risques en sortant cet album de reprises de chansons de Dylan, il a déjà donné dans ce gerne d'exercices en s'appropriant les morceaux écrits par d'autres. Son ""must"" restant à mon avis la lumineuse reprise de ""Jealous Guy"", à côté de laquelle l'originale est bien palotte. Le précédent album du crooner ""As time goes by"" était plutôt réussi, même si j'avais l'impression qu'il forçait encore un peu plus son côté agaçant crooner-précieux. Alors, voilà donc un album de reprises (de plus). Tout à fait d'accord avec un des commentateurs, concernant la voix :  nettement plus agréable et mélodieuse que celle de Bob, nasillarde et insupportable, dont les chansons sont bien souvent mieux interprétées par d'autres que par lui-même. C'eet marrant je comprends même les paroles ! habituellement marmonées par Dylan. Les morceaux portent indéniablement la patte de Bryan Ferry, soft, cool, même si (c'est bizarre les gouts!), j'avais un petit faible pour la reprise de Knockin'on Heaven's Door des Guns (c'est à peu près tout ce que j'écoute d'eux, avec One in a million), alors que des commentateurs précédents, détestent cette version visiblement. Chacun ses goûts !!!. Mais voilà, je suis fan de longue date de Roxy, y compris des albums de reformation qui tiennent à peu près tous la route. Pas puriste du tout, j'adore aussi pas mal d'albums solo de Ferry. Mais toutes ces reprises, çà finit par lasser. A l'instar de Joe Cocker incapable d'écrire une chanson, et dont tout le monde se fiche éperduement des albums récents copier-coller du précédent, Ferry ne prend plus de risques, et doit se contenter d'honorer ces contrats. Carrière superbe me direz-vous ? Yes, avec en prime un DVD récent sur lequel il retrouvait McKay, Manzanera, de haute volée. Suffit pas d'avoir sa voix (pourtant limite parfois, cf le LIVE AID 86, ou tout le monde y compris lui avait été écrasé par Freddy Mercury), et un style genre crooner-sof-classe-relax. Il est sûrement préférable de faire des albums, en y incluant une voire deux reprises (genre le single calibré pour faire plaisir sa maison de disques), plutôt que de sortir comme un métronome des disques de reprises, pour lesquels joue seulement un effet de surprise comparatif, sans grande inconnue. Au boulot Mr Ferry."
4,"Comment reprocher a un artiste aussi subversif que Manson de changer au fil de ses inspirations ? Album en effet different des autres, tres bon a mon gout. Plus Pop rock, melancollique a souhait...toujours puissant.  Un petit gout de renouveau bienvenue..... A ecouter....."
4,"pas trop d'accord avec toutes ses mauvaises critiques, j'aime beaucoup cet album, complètement différent, très musical, manson a toujours cette voix extraordinaire , c'est beaucoup plus rock que métal et c'est peut être cela qui dérange les afficionados!!! un petit plus , je l'ai vu à bercy le 5 juin, c'est vrai qu'il vieillit un peu mais quel prestance!!!"
1,"A déconseiller absolument aux amateurs de Metallica voir aux amateurs de musique tout court Cet album n'est qu'un enchainement de bruits et de sons sans que l'on arrive à ressortir même une seule chanson du lot. Si vous avez aimer Metallica jusqu'au   voir jusqu'à   n'écouter pas ce pseudo album où le groupe à finit par toucher le fond : à force de s'occuper des droits d'auteurs et de la protections des cds on oublie l'essentiel, faire de la musique. Il n'y a absolument rien à retenir de cet album qui est encore pire que le précédent   qui était pourtant déjà passablement mauvais Si vous aimez Metallica, alors achetez plutôt le dernier album   qui est une vraie résurrection du groupe : comme quoi les miracles sont possibles !"
5,"Comment passer à côté de cet extraordinaire premier album bourré de speed vitaminé, titres gorgés jusqu'à la gueule d'énergie communicative, plein de bonne humeur assuré. A replacer dans son époque bien sûr côté production mais bon, prenons un chanteur qui assure grave dans les aigus, des gratteux inspirés, une ambiance 'maidenesque"" sans pompage trop grossier, passages instrumentaux sublimes, rien à jeter que du bon et une belle carrière qui s'ouvre devant ces Teutons excités. Le speed classieux d'Helloween est né et règnera un bon moment, d'autres s'y essaieront avec plus ou moins de succès !! Un album à se procurer d'urgence et à consommer sans modération !!"
1,"Nous voilà confrontés à une lecture calamiteuse de Shéhérazade,d'un effroyable mauvais gout . A éviter absolument ,meme pour ce prix ! La discographie reste dominée par Monteux (Decca ) et Scherchen ( Westminster )."
1,"Boston était (je dis bien était) une perle dans l'univers du rock, tant par l'originalité de ses productions que par leur rareté ... Le dérapage amorcé sur le 4ème album se confirme et 'Corporate' est une soupe fadasse, très éloignée du rock originel, parfumée au rockman poussiéreux. J'ai écouté cet album 3 fois (comme quoi j'ai fait un effort !), il n'y aura pas de 4ème ... je préfère retourner aux 3 premiers opus, bien supérieurs. Grosse déception."
2,"je suis comme la plupart des fans du ""floyd"" un peu deçu de Gilmour j'aurais aimé...enfin comment dire plus de tonus, mais c'est vrai que le temps et donc l'age ne fait rien a l'affaire,on ne peut etre et avoir été.............."
1,"David Gilmour sort un album! Enfin l'interminable attente arrive à son terme. La musique commence...la musique va commencer...Bon le démarrage est un peu laborieux mais c'est certainement pour mieux apprécier la suite...On est déjà à la moitié de l'album et on essaye de croire qu'un morceau sublime va enfin nous faire chavirer...Non, c'est impossible, l'album ne peut pas être déjà terminé, il n'a jamais commencé! On n'y croit pas, on le remet, une fois, deux fois..et puis on se résigne: Pink Floyd c'est vraiment fini! Qu'as-tu-fait Dave? Pourquoi cette mélasse insipide?"
4,"Comme quoi écouter et acheter au hasard un album d'un groupe totalement inconnu à la pochette alléchante peut provoquer d'agréables surprises! Ce fut le cas cette semaine avec les allemands de The Vision Bleak et leur album ""Carpathia""... ***Première étape, la vue : Un superbe artwork, tout en sépia, illustrations anciennes, photos jaunies du duo, en pleine forêt dans une diligence sous le ciel dépourvu d'étoiles ...Gros gros effort pour nous faire entrer dans l'atmosphere macabre du récit !"
5,"Ryan Adams est prolixe, inspiré et tout et tout... cet objet-là est pour les fans et les autres aussi. Vous constaterez que mon inspiration est sans limites pour recommander chaudement ce disque qui ne comporte que des pépites."
5,"Je viens juste de commander l'album et ne l'ai pas encore ecoute, mais je connais un titre dessus qui est ""help me get the feeling"" interprete par King Curtis et Ray Sharpe. Si vous aimez la musique rythm'n blues un peu groovi, alors vous pouvez acheter ce disque juste pour ce titre car une fois que vous l'avez entendu,vous ne pouvez plus l'oublier et il devient indispensable à votre discographie!!!"
2,"fan de Gainsbourg, je peux ré-écouter son intégrale sur la semaine. Curieux d'entendre ce que les jeunes pouvaient faire avec tout la richesse de Gainsbourg, j'ai acheté cet album. J'en sors assez déçu: si Serge mérite le respect, il mérite aussi l'audace, qui fait ici cruellement défaut. Les beaux morceaux d'époque sont juste aseptisés, ils ont enlevé les grattes du disque, mais n'ont rien mis à la place. Pour collectioneur uniquement."
1,"5° Album 197O Réf 33T (Capitol SMAS 63O us) 1O Titres VALENTI. DUNCAN. ELMORE. CIPOLLINA. FREIBERG. + HOPKINS. NAFTALIN. REYES. + une section cuivre. Triste album . Chacun interprête son titre en solo; un titre pour Cippolina ""de la guitare électrique"" ; morceau musical un titre pour Freiberg un morceau de country cowboy qu'il chante ""il a eu le droit de chanter son titre"".  un titre pour Hopkins; du piano; morceau musical aussi. Le reste 7 titres pour Jesse oris farrow ? c'est Dino Valenti. Il chante. triste, sans saveur. Ecoutez la chanson ""All in my mind"" vocalement nulle."
2,"Peter Criss ne composait pas beaucoup dans KISS et reprenait les chansons de Paul (""black diamond"") ou Ace (""getaway"", ""strangeways""...), ça se ressent donc sur cet album qui tire plutot sur la corde sensible de ""Beth"" sans forcément y parvenir. Pas de hurlements de chat enragé comme dans ""baby driver"" ou ""nothin to lose"" sur lesquels il excellait pourtant. le hard rock est totalement banni et remplacé par des chansonnettes rock n roll avec orchestre de cuivre traditionnelles et sans grande originalité. Quelques titres ressortent comme la reprise d'un vieux standard ""tossin and turnin"" ou le trés lennonien ""easy thing"", belle (et unique) réussite de cet album produit par Vini Poncia (on l'a reconnu sur ""you matter to me"" et ses petits synthés typés ""croisière s'amuse"") qui prendra les commandes l'année suivante de ""dynasty"" mais avec beaucoup plus de réussites cette fois ..."
4,"dans la famille KISS je demande le vampire ! On s'attend à du sang sur les murs, des giclées de décibels et des hurlements sous la lune ? que nenni ! L'ami gene nous fait le coup du jardin secret, en dévoilant des facettes méconnues et inatendues de son talent. Certes y'a du bon gros rock qui roule (radiactive, burning up, living in sin..) mais c'est du coté des morceaux calmes et tendres (si si) que notre démon se revele particuliereremnt  doué : ecoutez Mr Make believe, see you tonight, always near you , vous en resterez bouche bée. Ces titres figurent dans mon panthéon personnel des plus belles ballades jamais écrites. A elles seules, elles méritent amplement l'achat de ce CD. seul bémol : la reprise tres hollywoodienne et superflue de when you wish upon a star."
2,"Fan des Minds depuis le début ou presque, je suis très déçu par la tournure qu'a pris leur carrière après Street Fighting Years. Déçu par le départ de Mike Mac Neil, par la baisse des ventes et de l'exposition du groupe... J'ai l'impression que l'album Our Songs Remain The Same aurait pu inverser la tendance s'il avait été commercialisé en 1999. Hélas, ce ne fut pas le cas pour des raisons assez sordides. Le groupe a eu du mal à s'en remettre : d'abord un album très moyen de reprises (Neon Lights) puis cet album Cry plutôt incohérent où la présence d'un invité surprise, Vince Clarke (d'Erasure) ne suffit pas à cacher la misère : le tandem Kerr/Burchill ne signe que 2 titres sur un album des Simple Minds ! Si on fait abstraction de cette question de la composition des chansons, et qu'on les écoute tout simplement , elles ne sont pas si mal, bien sûr. Il y a même des bons moments. Ca gâche un peu la fête des retrouvailles de penser que Jim et Charlie sont devenus l'espace d'un album des cordes vocales et cordes vocales à louer, mais on est quand même content de constater qu'il y a des musiciens, sûrement des fans eux aussi, qui ont envie d'écrire pour les Minds."
2,"Je préfère écouter : ""WEATHER REPORT"", ""MAHAVISHNU ORCHESTRA"" etc...Parce que ce CD n'a aucune émotion, pas de sensation, je ne ressent aucune vibration. Je suis peut-être trop dur, mais je préfère écouter des instrumentalistes."

5,"Produit bien reçu, 1 mois d'attente mais justifié par l'expéditeur. Très bon produit. Bonne communication"
1,"Une véritable tromperie que ce CD : 20 euros pour 50 titres dont une grande partie est en double avec, pour que cela ne se remarque pas trop, des durées légèrement différentes. Les interprètes sont passés sous silence aussi bien sur le site que sur la pochette, si bien qu'il faut ouvrir le CD pour se rendre compte qu'il s'agit d'interprétations par d'illustres inconnus ! en résumé, je le déconseille !"
4,"Mike rutherford trouve dans ""the mechanics"" et cet album, enfin la pleine mesure de son talent d'auteur-compositeur. Lui qui fut peut etre trop souvent le faire valoir discret de Genesis, prouve au travers des 13 morceaux de ce disque qu'il maitrise à la perfection l'art des mélodies finement ciselées qui pénètrent insidieusement le cerveau pour ne plus en sortir. Les autres artistes présents ne sont pas là pour la figuration et la sublime voix de Paul Young contribue à rendre l'ensemble chatoyant, sans tomber dans la pop sucrée. En résumé, un album dont on prend de plus en plus de plaisir au fur et à mesure des écoutes successives. Vraiment dommage de passer à coté."
2,"Dragonforce... Le groupe qui aurait du me passionner, me scotcher au fauteuil...et qui finalement me laisse de marbre. Comme quoi le vrai talent tient à peu de choses ! Je suis fan de tempos rapides, c'est comme ça. Blind Guardian me fait rêver, je me paluche sur Walls of Jericho et Ride the Lightning, c'est comme ça j'y peux rien, chacun ses perversions.... Alors quand on m'a parlé d'un groupe qui repoussait (et largement en plus) les limites de la speederie, j'ai été plus qu'intéressé. En effet ça va vite. Très vite. C'est impressionnant. Très. Les soli sont complètement fous, probablement les passages instrumentaux les plus fous que j'ai entendu depuis la paire de gratteux d'Angra, avec en plus une touche moderne et des sonorités originales. Le tableau semblait idyllique. Mais la mariée était trop belle : Sous la superbe robe, le joli maquillage et le porte jaretelle sexy se cachait en fait une damoiselle finalement assez quelconque et fadasse. Là où les groupe pré cités ont une vraie personnalité, et savoir faire de composition, Dragonforce aligne des plans ultra speed, des refrains happy metal et des claviers bontempi parfois de très mauvais goût. Nul doute que j'aurais été fou amoureux à 15 ans, mais à 30 j'ai déjà connu d'autres femmes et je sais ce qui est important dans une relation. Dragonforce brule la chandelle par les deux bouts, se maquille à outrance, et finit par lasser rapidement. On en reparle quand la miss a passé la puberté ?"
1,"radiohead est sans doute l'un des groupes les plus impressionnant de ces dernieres annees. apres leurs precedentes merveilles, ""the bends, ""pablo honey"" et surtout, l'insurpassable ""ok computer"", kid A etait forcement attendu au tournant... on a droit avec ce disque a une pochette de style futuriste assez laide...mais comme c'est radiohead, on se dit ""c'est super style, j'adore""... le livret aurait pu etre fait par un mome de 3 ans...ce sont des photos informes et quelques coups de crayons...risible mais le fan de radiohead aura la meme reaction que pour la pochette...j'en viens a la musique en elle-meme. en est-ce vraiment? ces 10 pistes aussi repoussantes, qui auraient pu etre creees par le clavier Bontempi que l'on m'avait offert pour mes 5 ans, sont-elles vraiment de radiohead?? le groupe s'est rendu compte qu'en poursuivant dans la voie que ""ok computer"", il ne pourrait le depasser. ils se sont donc dit qu'avec cet album, ils irraient la ou on ne les attendrait pas...et c'est reussi avec brio! cet album inclassable est volontairement rate! la ou l'on voit la force de radiohead, c'est qu'ils sont parvenus a faire aimer cet echec au monde entier! que serait ce disque s'il n'etait pas de radiohead?? personne n'en voudrait. les smashing pumpkins desormais separes, Radiohead est aujourd'hui le plus grand groupe du monde grace a cela. applaudissements"

2,"Album décevant, les compositions ne manquent pas d'intérêt, notamment le troisième morceau et ses solos de guitare. Mais l'athmosphère est lourde, la production brouillonne, le son irritant."
4,"Lorsque que ce nouvel opus de motley est sorti on ne peut pas dire que ce soit l'album de référence du groupe pourtant il mérite d'etre écouté car il est bon en grande partie . Titre au dessus du lot :""glitter"" &amp; ""let us prey "" &amp; ""generation swine"". La pochette est plutot marrante avec des cochons en costard . Mais il faut et il peuvent encore mieux faire et ils l'on fait ."
5,"Que dire... J'avais l'album précédent mais là, j'avoue que je ne m'attendais pas à ça. Apparemment, le groupe est arrivé à maturité car le virage est assez radical. Tandis que le deuxième album sonne plutôt à la AC/DC et on peut dire ""encore un groupe de copieur du style 70's"", là, The Mooney Suzuki semble avoir trouvé leur propre style. Le son est épuré, la voix du chateur aussi, moins hard rock et beaucoup plus rock'n' roll. Chaque morceau a sa propre richesse et originalité; des fois un début assez banale (comme le morceau d'ouverture ""99%"" qui s'ouvre à la fin vers des coeurs feminins type gospel; des fois il n'y a tout simplement rien à dire : la musique coule de source. Certains morceaux ont l'accent du sud, à la guitare sèche ""Ashes"", l'excellent ""Down but not out"" ou encore ""Leap of faith"". Pour couronner le tout, l'album se termine par un pure morceau de rock'n roll ""You Never Really Wanted To Rock'n' Roll"" que si Billy Holliday pouvait l'entendre, il serait certainement retourner dans sa tombe par honte de ne pas avoir fait un morceau avec autant d'énergie. At last but not least, l'icroyable ""Good ol' alcohol"" où il semble se déverser non seulement tout le bourbon des Etats Unis mais également la moitié de l'esprit blues de la Nouvelle Orleans. Bon, bref, comme un critique de musique avait dit des années auparavant à propos de l'album de Thunder : ""Achetez cet album ou soyez damnés!"""
5,"Cet album est une pure merveille!  Ballades mélodiques extraordinaires, accompagnements de génie et une touche de blues mélancolique pour parfaire cet album que je conseille à tout ceux qui ne l'ont pas écouté et je vous assure que vous allez l'apprécier!"
2,"Disque fait à la va vite et le problème c'est que ça s'entend ! Les compos sont très moyennes, le son est crade et le tout très sombre voir glauque. Cela frémit sur quelques morceaux mais ça ne décolle jamais. Très inférieur à Nevermind"
2,"cet album ne vaut pas un bon brut de femme ( de diams) ou jackpot ( chingy). Si on aime pas le rap français qui fait un peu rap ancien alors, il ne vaut mieux pas acheter. Au moins avec les chansons de rappeurs américains, quand les paroles sont nulles tu les entends pas mais là t'es obligé. Alors je n'aurais qu'une chose à dire, c'est plutôt moyen. Dès qu'on écoute les deux premières chansons, ça donne pas envie de continuer."
1,"Fan de King Crimson, Yes, et autres génies de la musique «progressive», passez votre chemin. Si comme moi vous vous laissez avoir par l'alléchante affiche (John Wetton et Steve Howe sont de très grands messieurs), vous ne pourrez qu'être affligés par ce galimatias disco pseudo-symphonique parfaitement indigeste. A l'époque, la critique tirait à boulets rouges sur la production de ce «super-groupe» ; pour une fois, elle voyait juste, dénonçant la dérive commerciale de ces grands musiciens complètement désarçonnés par les profondes et rapides mutations de l'époque et la mise sous tutelle de la production artistique par l'industrie du show-business."
4,"Bien sur chaque album des beatles est indispensable car dans l'ensemble ils n'ont pas produits de titres mauvais,quelquefois moins inspires c'est sur mais c'est difficile d'ecrire ou de reprendre que des chefs d'oeuvres,pour ce 1er disque enregistre en 1 journee de studio(il fallait le faire),les fabs font plus de covers que de chansons personnelles,mais dans le lot ,on peut deja savourer 2 superbes compos avec""i saw her standing there""un super rock et""please please me""deja de la superbe pop beatles,les autres titres sont moins forts avec ""love me do""belle melodie bluesy ""ps i love you""tres datee ""do you want to know a secret""chanson sympa ecrite pour george de la part de john, ""misery"" et ""there's aplace""belle petite chanson pop ou le chant a l'unisson de john et paul donne deja des frissons. Cote reprise le meilleur reste ""boys"" rock chante par ringo ""a taste of honey"" ballade chantee par paul et surtout ""LA VERSION"" de ""twist and shout"" avec la voie dechiree tres rock de lennon epuise par cette seance de studio interminable. Un bon disque pour decouvrir les debuts des fabs.pascal49"
5,"j'ai ecouté douha alia, je ne connais pas les paroles en francais, et je le regrette, mais je pense que cette chanson retrace une histoire vecue, sans connaitre les paroles en francais cette melodie me fait sortir les larmes des yeux quel talent!!!"
1,"6 ans pour... ça?  cet album est certainement le pire depuis le début de sa carrière. Le premier single sorti est indigne d'elle: ça se veut ""chanson à texte"" et ça donne une mauvaise imitation de chanson à texte. Quand au deuxième single, Q.I, désolé pour les fans inconditionnels qui manquent de recul sur leur idole, mais en plus d'être mal écrit, c'est aussi mal chanté. Des jeux de mots tous droits sortis du dictionnaire pour une chanson dont le titre révèle bien que le manque d'insipiration touche tout le monde, et même elle. Et pitié, qu'elle arrête d'aller dans les aigus: on dirait qu'on est en train d'écorcher une dinde vivante. Elle aurait dû s'arrêter à son dernier album et tout aurait été parfait. Là, c'est même plus désolant, c'est pathétique."
2,"Let's talk about love est aux années 80 ce que Victory est aux années 2000 pour Modern Talking, c'est à dire les 2 albums les plus doux et différents des autres albums de leur carrière. Ici ils échangent la ribanbelle de tubes habituelle contre un calme et une douceur inhabituelle : ce qui est inévitable quand on prend l'habitude de sortir 20 titres par an pendant 8 ans. Ce qui n'empêche pas de trouver ici des presques tubes comme With a little love ou Just like an angel et de très jolies chansons comme Don't give up, la chanson-titre Let's talk about love sans oublier le tube Cheri Cheri lady. Mais dans leur période années 80, on aurait tendance à leur préférer les albums 1 3 et 5 (The first album - Ready for romance - Romantic warriors) qui sont nettement plus énergiques."
2,"Le très ambitieux projet d'intégrale de l'oeuvre pianistique de Franz Liszt chez Naxos ravira les amateurs de piano : on notera d'abord l'homogénéité de la collection avec un portrait changeant à chaque disque, des volumes numérotés au contenu thématique, différents lieux d'enregistrement (Angleterre, Etats-Unis, Hongrie, Allemagne, Canada) et des interprètes plus ou moins connus mais souvent de haut vol et de toute nationalité. C'est ce qui fera tout son intérêt si on la compare à l'intégrale achevée du marathonien Leslie Howard chez Hypérion, certes de qualité mais bien trop monotone dans le fond comme dans la forme et beaucoup plus chère ! A noter par contre que les dates d'enregistrements ne correspondent pas systématiquement aux dates de sortie et que la régularité de celles-ci en déconcertera plus d'un, mais l'aventure durera plusieurs années, donc  patience ! Liszt écrivit très peu de pièces pour deux pianos. Malheureusement, l'enregistrement proposé ici ne me convainc pas : d'une part parce qu'il s'agit d'une transcription de sa propre Dante symphonie, oeuvre emblématique qui nécessite toutes les couleurs de l'orchestre pour transmettre son message, d'autre part parce que la version me paraît bien confuse et lourde, voire ennuyeuse. A noter que la version 2 pianos de la Dante sonata tirée des années de pèlerinage et due à un des solistes n'a absolument aucun intérêt : à part vouloir faire plus de bruit par des doublages à l'octave ou des trémolos sans fin, elle démontre brillamment que l'on ne doit pas toucher aux chefs-d'oeuvre. Livret anglais."
2,"Nile a changé de maison d'édition. On se dit ""Nuclear Blast"" en général c'est bien. Nile est américain. Et là NB a dû vouloir faire découvrir Nile au public allemand. Allez savoir pourquoi, le public allemand connaît l'Egypte (voir Indiana Jones). Au bilan : une soupe tiédasse, sans inspiration, sans LE ou LES morceaux qui transforment tout production de Nile en tuerie organisée proto-lovecraftienne. Ou en concept ""prog"" avec du brutal deathmé sur 17 mn d'un tenant. Je suis donc très déçu, et j'attends 2009."
5,"Le deuxième album du groupe norvégien est un peu plus abouti. On se retrouve à mi-chemin entre du Darkthrone, du Mayhem et du Dark Funeral, avec une petite touche heavy et doom qui leur est propre. A l'instar de pas mal de disques de black, ils ne jouent pas sur la longueur -moins de trente minutes de musique- mais sur la densité, l'intensité et l'ambiance sinistre de bout en bout. Je trouve qu'il y a plus de variété et de relief que sur ""Pentagram"" : rien qu'en écoutant ""Bergtrollets hevn"" ou ""Gorgoroth"", on se rend compte de la profondeur des compositions, de la maîtrise du chaos sonore malgré le peu d'instruments en lice. Apparition du vocaliste Pest, qui remplace Hat sur la moitié des morceaux et fera désormais partie du line-up. En gros, je trouve que c'est un chef-d'oeuvre de true black, faussement simpliste et très atmosphérique."
5,"Sous le même label que les incroyables Godspeed You ! Black Emperor fluctuent un nombre de groupes divers dont Hangedup. Vu il y a de cela quelques jours lors d'un concert, je me suis empressé d'acheter leur album et la claque du live n'a pas perdu de sa force lors de l'écoute de l'album. C'est un réel enchantement. Une batterie métallique et surtout la démiurge violonniste nous emmènent dans la profondeur musicale et lancinante jusqu'à la sublimation des émotions."
4,"Je l'avoue ! j'ai décroché de WASP après ""crimson idol"" (album que je qualifie , encore aujourd'hui , d'un peu pompeux et pas toujours très réussi) . 15 ans se sont écoulées depuis , et c'est avec fébrilité , et un certain apriori , que je me suis toute fois penché sur la nouvelle galette du Sieur BLACKIE . Je dois me rendre à l'évidence , dès le morceau d'introduction le Ton est donné ... ""DOMINATOR"" est une tuerie qui ne faiblit (presque) jamais tout au long de ses 43'27 . Quelle patate ! quelle pêche ! quelle puissance ! et quel SON ! . Car oui ! il faut bien l'admettre , la qualité au niveau de la production chez WASP n'a jamais été son point fort , mais là ...!! Au niveau de la comparaison justement , et bien que s'inscrivant totalement dans son époque , cet album n'est toute fois pas sans me rappeler certaines des premières oeuvres du groupe : ""ELECTRIC CIRCUS"" pour son esprit très rock'n'roll , ""CRIMSON IDOL"" parce que ""The burning man"" n'aurait nullement dépareillé sur ce même disque , et enfin ""HEADLESS CHILDREN"" pour sa semblable furie . Un petit bémol toute fois ! : D'abord sur sa durée un peu limite , surtout si l'on remarque que l'un des 9 titres n'est autre qu'une reprise d'éclinée de ""heaven's hung in black"" ... Dommage! Et puis pour finir , s'il y a parmis vous des fans de PINK FLOYD (ce qui semble être le cas de BLACKIE) , jeter vous sur ""Heaven's hung in black"" et ses 7'15 . Sans conteste la pièce maîtresse de ce ""Dominator"" . 17/20"
2,"L'ombre d'Elliott Smith plane sur cet album. Mais si Kevin Tihista officie dans un registre semblable à celui du songwriter récemment disparu (pour faire court : pop songs mélodiques et mélancoliques), il n'en a malheureusement pas le talent."
4,"Non, je n'ai rien contre Shania Twain ou Faith Hill, mais cela fait tout de meme rudement plaisir d'ecouter un veritable album de country feminin, avec une production tres actuelle, mais sans pour autant qu'elle perde son identite. Cette Joe Dee Messina, decouverte grace a Georges Lang, est une vraie merveille. Et en plus, elle aussi elle est belle, ce qui ne gache rien"
5,"Cet album est super!Je connaissais Aly par ""phil du futur"" et j'avais envie de voir ce que ça donnait avec sa soeur.Je ne regrette absolument pas de l'avoir acheté!"
4,"Back in Black fut le dernier disque d'AC/DC que j'ai acheté, possédant tous les précédents.Pour moi un chef d'oeuvre absolu de har rock. Puis je suis passé à autre chose...... D'après les critiques ce Black Ice  serait leur nouveau chef d'oeuvre.. Alors je me suis fait pousser les cheveux, j'ai mis mes culottes courtes et je suis parti l'acheter!! Qu'attend- on d'AC/DC? Sûrement pas qu'ils nous mettent des nappes de mellotron sur leurs riffs! Pas le cas ici, ouf!!!  Qu'est ce que AC/DC? Finalement une géniale synthèse de LedZep des Who et des Stones, mais pas seulement, il y a la recette du chef : d'abord il y a le riff de guitare (bonne vieille Gibson SG avec Marshall caniculaire obligé), puis la rythmique diabolique, sans fioritures mais qui donne tout de suite envie de bouger le petit orteil gauche, puis la voix, Brian Johnson qui me fout toujours la chair de poule depuis que je l'ai entendu la première fois avec Geordie dans les 70's, et enfin il y a l'hymne ou le refrain comme vous voulez, et là, on est servi dès ""Rock'nroll train"". Pas de déception donc, les 15 morceaux suivent la recette précédemment décrite, en inversant ici et là les deux premiers éléments. Une heure de hard, c'est plus que dans Back in black -cd oblige- et on se dit peut-être que quelques morceaux pouvaient être dispensés (""money made""). Mais bon c'est cracher dans une bonne soupe tout de même. L'esprit et la matière sont bien vivants ici et ce disque aurait pu sortir en 1980.. ça fait plaisir de savoir que des choses restent immuables! Je mets 4 étoiles car je suis un peu déçu par Angus, ses solos sont très courts et plutôt rares (on attend toujours celui de ""Rock'nroll dream"" ce qui aurait pu faire un morceau d'une belle envergure. Un cran en dessous de Back in black donc, mais c'est tout bon les mecs, rock'roll ain't gonna die!!!"
2,COMMENT DIRE............ VOUS AVEZ AIME CE DISQUE A CE POINT????? MOUAIS........A CONDITION DE N'EN AVOIR JAMAIS ECOUTE UN SEUL AUPARAVANT.. AH ILS SONT FORTS....JAMAIS VU AUTANT POUR UNE SORTIE D ALBUM... ET DE TOUTES LES COULEURS EN PLUS... BIEN ENTENDU C EST AC/DC  UNE SEMAINE QUE JE N ECOUTE QUE CA OU SONT LES MELODIES??? FAIRE TOUT UN FOIN POUR CA............. SERAI JE LE SEUL A CASSER LE MYTHE??????
1,"Ce disque est médiocre et manque fondamentalement d'originalité. C'est sans doute bien placé en tête de gondole dans les hypers, un point. Sans parler de l'obsénité dégagés par ce groupe de gamines sans talent. A vaumire!"
2,"Je suis fan de HIM depuis le début et j'aime chacun de leurs albums mais je suis déçu par dark light. Je crois bien qu'il s'agit là de leur premier faux pas. Cet album cloche, l'inspiration n'est pas au rendez-vous et HIM semble avoir perdu de sa superbe, ou tout simplement de son talent."
2,"Tout d'abord, il faut savoir que cet album a été réalisé par Tony Martin, Cozy Powell, Neil Murray et Tony Iommi, seul membre d'origine du Black Sabbath des annés 70. Ainsi, je ne pense pas que l'on puisse dire que ""TYR"" soit véritablement un album de Black Sabbath à part entière. Black Sabbath, pour moi, c'est autre chose quand on connait la formation d'origine. Ce n'est absolument pas de la nostalgie (d'ailleurs je n'y était pas), mais la qualité des compos de ""TYR"" n'est pas à la hauteur, et elles manquent d'inspiration. Pourtant, les albums réalisés en 80 avec Ronnie James Dio avait su garder la continuité de ce qui avait été fait, et c'était très bon. Malheureusement, ici on ne retrouve ni le son ni le style du ""vrai"" sabbath. Un peu de son de guitare, trop d'arrangements synthé grand public, et même si la production reste de qualité moyenne, pour le vrai fan de sabbath (ou même pour quelqu'un d'autre), c'est de la varieté un peu légère. Donc, je ne veux pas être méchant (je suis quand même un grand fan de Black Sabbath), mais juste de dire que si vous voulez entendre quelque chose comme ""Paranoid"", ""Iron Man"", ""N.I.B."" ou même ""The mob rules"", passez votre chemin et achetez plutôt un vrai album de sabbath, ou vous serez déçu par ""TYR"" qui n'a pas grand chose à voir avec l'atmosphère et le style de la formation originale. Heureusement que les vrais membres de Black Sabbath se sont récemment réunis... ;)"
4,"Il s'agit ici d'une musique très calme, alternant mélodies mélancoliques simples et passages plus atmosphériques où une certaine tension se fait sentir. Le thème principal et ses nombreuses variations sont superbes. Danny Elfman réutilise de manière anecdotique les deux premiers mouvements de sa Serenada Schizophrana. Le style général est résolument proche du courant de la musique répétitive ou minimaliste américaine. Un album au final très agréable qu'on réécoute avec plaisir !"
2,"Plus grand girl-group de l'histoire, les Supremes de Diana Ross ne sortent pas grandies de cette compilation ratée, reprenant deux 33 T originaux des filles, respectivement parus en 1964 et 1966. Certes ces albums étaient devenus rares voire introuvables en Cd. Mais il faut savoir que dans la politique de la Motown (maison de disques des Supremes), le 33 T ne servait qu'à occuper le public entre les parutions de 45 T qui eux bénéficiaient de tous les soins du label. Ainsi chaque année les artistes Motown « sortaient » 2 ou 3 albums et à peu près autant de compilations, multipliant les redites. « Where did our love go ? » est semble-t-il le premier disque des Supremes et sans atteindre le sommets comporte les premiers succès du groupe (la chanson-titre, « Come see about me », « Baby love »), et est bien meilleur que « I hear a symphony », surtout composé de reprises entourant les deux hits « maison » « I hear a symphony » et « My world is empty without you ». Mais là où le bât blesse avec cette réédition, c'est au niveau de la qualité sonore, proche de l'abominable. S'agit-il des mixages d'origine en stéréo (généralement enregistrés lors des séances mais pas diffusés, les 45 T étant mono), ou les rééditeurs ont-ils saboté un transfert des bandes mono d'origine vers une stéréo qu'ils jugeaint plus adaptée au marché actuel ? Dans tous les cas et quand bien même la qualité sonore aurait été au rendez-vous, cette réédition est pour un public complétiste, une bonne compilation étant pour le commun des mortels la meilleure façon d'aborder la carrière des Supremes."
1,"on a l'impression d'être en con-cerre du côté de beuvron le chalaouettes, ...près d'un cormoran qui dort...vert et humide.. qui aurait avalé une clarinette..comme dit nietsch fritch et pif gadget...."
1,"Le titre de débart est for-mi-da-ble... uptempo à souhait et commercial dans le bon sens du terme mais la suite ô la suite, quelle catastrophe, on s'ennuie, on s'........, jusqu'à UN REVE DE FILLE. Un conseil, que les fils souchon et voulzy arrêtent de travailler et pour eux et pour leurs pères respectifs et pour quiconque... un internaute parle du visuel réussi, en effet, je le trouve magnifique et rappelant un peu vanessa et la pub coco chanel. j'aurais préféré que sorte un simple single accompagné de la vidéo dont j'ai entraperçue un extrait et qui m'avait l'air inspiré !"
1,"Alors vraiment j'ai rarement entendu une chanson plus ridicule que cette ""nolwenn ohwo""! La mélodie est incompréhensible, il y a trop de parties, le texte est naze et alors tout cela ne tient pas debout. Le reste du Disque est à l'avenant, lourd gras , boursouflé, et pour tout dire sans aucun intêret. En résumé, très Mauvais."
1,"Personne ne peut nier que Nolwenn a une belle voix, malheureusement, ses chansons ne nous transportent pas. Ce manque d'émotion est flagrant sur ""Cassé"", peut être à cause des paroles qui sont médiocres. Si Nolwenn pouvait trouver un peu plus de spontanéité, l'album y gagnerait et notre plaisir d'auditeur aussi."
1,"Ce n'est pas Salieri qui a assassiné Mozart, comme l'a laissé entendre Milos Forman dans son ridicule ""Amadeus"", mais nombre d'interprètes qui ont défiguré (et continuent de défigurer) son oeuvre. Après avoir pendant plus de dix ans ""massacré"" Vivaldi, voilà que Fabio Bondi et son Europa Galante s'en prennent à Mozart.  Ces derniers avaient renoncé à ""interpréter"" Vivaldi pour ""faire du Biondi"", voilà qu'en cette année Mozart ils se sont lancés dans l'interprétation des trois permiers concertos pour violon et orchestre du compositeur salzbourgeois. Les reproches essentiels sont toujours les mêmes : agressivité des allegros, sacrifice des adagios (transformés en allegros dont le superbe adagio du concerto n°3 KV 216) et des andantes, aucune souplesse dans les articulations entre les différents mouvements,...  Par chance, ils ne nous ont pas livré une intégrale : les concertos n°4 et n°5 ainsi que les deux rondos KV 269 et KV 373 et le superbe adagio KV 261 ont échappé à la mutilation qui les attendait inévitablement."
5,fabuleux cd qui vous emporte dans un rythme époustoufflant  excellement joué et plus que jamais très ....moderne  à partager sans modération  entre amis
1,"Cet album à le mérite de traduire à merveille , grâce à son titre , le désordre intérieur qu'il procure à un auditeur comme moi . A l'écoute d'Octavarium , je pensais que le groupe avait enfin compris qu'en matière de musique , la technique ne trouvait sa place qu'à la seule condition qu'elle permette à chacun des morceaux de se hisser et de nous emmener vers les chemins de l'ambiant , de la beauté et de l'émotion au lieu de la conjuguer trop souvent en démonstration stylistique ou la rapidité et la facilité technique des protagonistes fini toujours par prendre le pas sur la mélodie . Malheureusement DT ne l'a toujours pas compris et ennuie , pire ! nous écoeur par delà ses prouesses , nous gavant telle une oie d'un déluge de n'importe quoi . De plus , lorsqu'une once d'inspiration vient se glisser quelques fois au milieu de cette partouze sonore , celle ci nous démontre d'abord , qu'avant d'être des Fans , la bande à Portnoy ne parvient au final qu'à pillier sans vergogne l'héritage de ses glorieux ainés ( YES , GENESIS ou FLOYD au registre du Prog ) .   La grande différence finalement , c'est que tous ces ""Anciens"" ne sortaient nullement de toutes ces prestigieuses écoles américaines , mais jouaient  avant tout avec coeur , feeling et sensibilité . Dommage Monsieur Labrie qu'il faille , cela aussi , vous l'apprendre . Une étoile pour la pochette et son livret ... Très beau lui !"
2,"Depuis que Fish est en solo, la qualité de ses disques est vraiment en dent de scie, et suit la même schéma: un grand album; un album moyen avec un ou deux perles; et un album insignifiant. ""Fields of Crows"" fait malheureusement parti des insignifiants... Rien de nouveau, nulle part où la voix de Fish doit faire face à la musique... Seul le rock-blues ""The rookie"" et la ballade marillionesque ""scattering crows"" valent l'écoute, mais vous laisseront sur votre faim. Vivement le prochain, cela devrait être un bon!"
2,"""Down In The Groove"" est le 25è album studio de Bob Dylan, il a été enregistré en avril et mai 1987 et a été publié le 31 mai 1988. Deux ans se sont écoulés depuis la parution du pas terrible ""Knocked Out Loaded"" et la sortie de cet album. On se rend bien compte en l'écoutant que le ""Zim"" traverse une mauvaise passe. L'album contient seulement 4 compositions de Bobby sur 10 chansons, soit 6 reprises, un signe ??? Autant sur ""Self Portrait"" en 1970, on s'était bien amusé en écoutant Bob chanter les chansons des autres, mais là on s'ennuie ferme.  Pourtant en regardant la pochette, on voit notre Bobby la guitare en bandoulière et on s'attend à un retour aux sources en toute simplicité, et bien c'est loupé, il s'est entouré d'un nombre impressionnants de musiciens prestigieux comme Eric Clapton, Sly Dunbar, Jerry Garcia, Ron Wood, Mark knopfler, Nathan East, Steve Jones, Paul Simonon etc.... et quand on entend le résultat on se dit que c'est quand même un beau gâchis !!! On peut tout de même sauver du naufrage ""Let's Stick Togethher"" et surtout "" Silvio"" qui sortira en single, le reste est à oublier."
2,"Quelle déception à l'écoute de cet album que je considère comme le plus mauvais de sa carrière :  1. Un CD qui ne compte même pas 40 mn.  2. La voix n'est plus ce qu'elle était, abimée par des années de tabagisme (et ce n'est pas fini).  3. Le choix des chansons (saluons une certaine volonté de diversification) mais les paroles sont d'une telle insipidité, qu'il s'agisse du titre éponyme, de ""Corsica"", ""Pense à l'Italie"" ou le navrant ""L'Amérique de mes dix ans"". Seul le dernier titre ""Cette chanson là"" sauve ce CD d'un irrémédiable naufrage.  Cette impression est totalement subjective mais l'interprétation révèle que Michel n'y croit plus : sa force a toujours résidé dans le fait qu'il vivait ses chansons."
4,"Le vingtième siècle a vu la composition de plusieurs cycles de symphonies de très grande qualité, depuis celui de Guy Ropartz (1864-1955) à celui de Péteris Vasks (né en 1946), en passant par celui de Carl Nielsen (1865-1931), d'Alexandre Glazunov (1865-1936), de Jean Sibelius (1865-1957), de Wilhelm Peterson-Berger (1867-1942), de Charles Tournemire (1870-1939), de Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872-1958), de Hugo Alfvén (1872-1960), d'Havergal Brian (1876-1972), de Karl Weigl (1881-1949), de Nikolaï Miaskovsky (1881-1950), de Gian Francesco Malipiero (1882-1973), d'Arnold Bax (1883-1953), d'Egon Wellesz (1885-1974), d'Heitor Villa-Lobos (1887-1959), d'Ernst Toch (1887-1964), de Kurt Atterberg (1887-1974), de Bohuslav Martinü (1890-1959), de Serge Prokofiev (1891-1953), d'Arthur Honegger (1892-1955), de Darius Milhaud (1892-1974), de Walter Piston (1894-1976), de Paul Hindemith (1895-1963), de Boris Lyatoshinsky (1895-1968), d'Howard Hanson (1896-1931), de Roger Sessions (1896-1985), d'Alexandre Tansman (1897-1986), de Roy Harris (1898-1979), de Carlos Chávez (1899-1978), d'Ernst Krenek (1900-1991), d'Edmund Rubbra (1901-1986), de Vissarion Chebaline (1902-1963), de Gavriil Popov (1904-1972), de Karl Amadeus Hartmann (1905-1963), d'Eduard Tubin (1905-1982), de William Alwyn (1905-1985), de Benjamin Frankel (1906-1973), de Dmitri Chostakovitch (1906-1975) bien sûr, mais aussi d'Arnold Cooke (1906-2005), d'Ahmed Adnan Saygun (1907-1991), de Camargo Guarnieri (1907-1993), de Miloslav Kabelác (1908-1979), de Vagn Holmboe (1909-1996), de William Schuman (1910-1992), d'Allan Pettersson (1911-1980), d'Alan Hovhaness (1911-2000), de Donald Gillis (1912-1978), de Daniel Jones (1912-1993), d'Humphrey Searle (1915-1982), de David Diamond (1915-2005), d'Isang Yun (1917-1995), de George Rochberg (1918-2005), de Lex van Delden (1919-1988), de Cláudio Santoro (1919-1989), de Mieczyslaw Weinberg (1919-1996), de Galina Oustvolskaïa  (1919-2006), d'Alexander Lokshin (1920-1987), de Robert Simpson (1921-1997), de Malcolm Arnold (1921-2006), d'Hans Werner Henze (né en 1926), d'Einojuhani Rautavaara (né en 1928), de John Davison (né en 1930), d'Aubert Lemeland (né en 1932), de Krzysztof Penderecki (né en 1933), d'Alfred Schnittke (1934-1998), de Peter Maxwell Davies (né en 1934), de Valentin Silvestrov (né en 1937), de Boris Tishchenko (né en 1939), de Leif Segerstam (né en 1944), ou bien encore de Jean-Claude Wolff (né en 1946), sans compter de nombreux chef-d'oeuvres isolés. Certaines des six symphonies que nous a laissé Arnold Cooke (1906-2005) sont tout à fait intéressantes."
4,"Quand j'ai entendu cet album je n'es pas réussi à croire qu'il était sorti en 1971. Il parait si contemporain. Can est une source officielle d'inspiration pour radiohead dont on peut retrouver certains aspects. Un voyage vers un monde fantastique, un style indéfinissable.  Bref un CD magique"
5,"Voyez en cet album un incontournable du rap US. Ses qualités ? Des productions subtiles de RZA auxquelles se superposent les touches personnelles de chaque rappeur, le résultat est exceptionnel."
4,"On peut dire que le retour de Lady Laistee après un bon premier album était très attendu. A-t-elle reussi son pari ? on peut dire que la réponse est OUI! Moins sombre que le premier album,  dancefloor sur des prod du BOSS, de Matt de Sulee B l'album est très éclectique...La Mygale n'a pas non plus rater le casting pour les featurings. Sont invités sur ce 16 titres : Matt, Tiwony ou encore Diams sur le bon Respect. mention spéciale pour les titres Bouger la tete, Shorty, Douce France et Diamant noir qui justifie à eux seul l'achat de cette album."
2,Je suis profondément déçu... J'ai connu Rahzel avec ses passages tele sur MTV et j'était émerveillé par son dont qu'est le Beat Box. Je me suis rendu compte qu'il n'était pas doué pour faire un album qui retranscrise son énegie sur scene. Pour ceux qui souhaitent l'acheter je leur conseille de se procurer les petits lives qu'il fait de droite à gauche. Il n' y a que les tracks 2et 4 qui sont bien. En revanche les petites interludes ( des beats fait en lives) et la fin cachée du Cd sont parfaites. Dommage.
2,"Album décevant si on le compare aux deux précedents opus. Là où il y avait finesse se trouve désormais bruitisme. J'attendais beaucoup de cet album, et sans qu'il soit vraiment mauvais, ma déception est à la hauteur de mon attente."
5,"Ce disque est une pure merveille ! On y retrouve les différentes versions du tube ""Love, don't let me go"", et elles sont toutes mieux les unes que les autres. Pour tout ceux qui sont des amoureux de la musique techno et de David Guetta, ce disque est un véritable petit bijou. On ne se lasse pas de l'écouter et c'est avec un grand plaisir que l'on y retrouve la chanson culte ""Love, don't let me go"" remaniée et retravaillée. Pour tout ceux qui craquent pour David Guetta et qui adore le tube ""Love, don't let me go"", il est indispensable d'acheter cette merveille."
5,"Early Warnings ressemble au premier abord à ces fonds de tiroir qui ne peuvent intéresser que les fans, façon ""How to make a monster"" des Cramps, avec des extraits de démos et du live première période ; et en effet le premier disque reste vaguement anecdotique. Il y a d'abord une démo présentée comme ""les premiers enregistrements studios du groupe"". Cinq morceaux, pas inintéressant du reste : une version embryonnaire de ""Goodbye Johnny"", ""Preaching the Blues"" déja définitive, et, surprise, ""Watermelon Man"" qui ne sortira que sur Miami, embryonnaire elle aussi, mais déja passionnante. S'ensuit un live, enregistré entre les deux premiers albums. Rien à dire, c'est du live, petite surprise toutefois avec une version très primitive de ""Walkin with the beast"", et déja le ""Strange Fruit"" free-jazz, mal assuré, bien moins réussie que sur le live de ""Death Party"". Jusqu'ici pas de quoi crier au génie, le live est correct, ""Fire Spirit"" est très bonne et Jeffrey en fait des caisses sur ""Preachin' the Blues"".  Non, la grosse affaire c'est le deuxième disque : des ""home recordings"", c'est-à-dire Jeffrey seul à la guitare qui chante ses compositions. Et là, c'est la claque. Jeffrey, qui a toujours été un chanteur de blues, retrouve ici le son brut, dépouillé, rapeux de la musique de Tommy Johnnson dont il chante le ""Cool Dronk of Water Blues"". C'est une merveille de l'entendre ainsi, seul et acoustique, chanter ce qui sera le répertoire du groupe et qui, à ce stade, pourrait aussi bien être un choix de reprises obscures, choisies par un maniaque du pre-war blues. On reconnait vaguement ""Ghost on the Highway"" dans un titre appelé ""The Devil and the Nigger"", tandis que ""American Promise"" n'est autre que ""Midnight Promise"", la sublime chanson qui clôt ""Wildweed"". Mais il y aussi des chansons magnifiques dont on ne sait ce qu'elles sont devenues, ni d'où elles viennent, telle ""Desire by Blues River"" ; et le tout, primitif au possible, dépouillé, atteignant la vérité même du blues, son essence brute. Jeffrey peut se permettre de siffler les solos sur ""Gonna find my baby"", ou de jouer de l'harmonica dans un style très cajun sur ""Hey Madame"" : tout est parfait, tout est là, déja, les fondations du Gun Club, dans cet album essentiel."
5,"Tres bel album, plus on l'ecoute plus il se revele riche. Certaines sonorites sont communes a Cesaria Evora, mais cela n'enleve en rien le talent de Lura, une belle chanteuse avec une tres belle voix."
1,"C'est dommage que des gens s'amuse à remixer des compositions de Jean-Michel Jarre car il ya un effet de reprise qui altère completement la musique de percussions et on se retrouve dans un contexte plus de musique techno que de l'oeuvre de l'artiste, bien dommage!!!"
1,"C'est la plus grosse erreur marketing de Jarre!!Je mets une étoile pour être sympa, mais c'est une véritable déception! Je ne l'ai écouté qu'une seule fois. Pourtant, je suis un fan inconditionnel de cet artiste. Pour ceux qui seraient quand même tentés d'acheter cet album, je leur conseille plutôt ""Oxygène 7-13"", beaucoup plus naturel."
4,"Je dois avouer que j'avais un peu mis rickie lee jones aux oubliettes depuis quelques années (quelques réécoutes ponctuelles de pirates ou de son premier opus la rappelaient à mon bon souvenir), et particulièrement après un concert catastrophique de 45 minutes à Paris (en 99 je crois) avec boites à rythmes à l'appui. Et puis, il y a quelques semaines, son nouveau single passe à la radio, et la magie revient. Je me rue donc pour me procurer cette nouvelle galette. Que du bonheur ! On se croirait de retour au bon vieux temps de Chuck E, avec une bonne touche jazzy en plus. Sa voix cristalline est toujours fabuleuse, et les arrangements complexes et fins propulsent l'auditeur dans une autre dimension. Ajoutez à cela un zeste de contestation politique à l'encontre de Bush, et vous obtenez un cocktail détonnant. Un retour en grande pompe à ne pas rater !"
5,"KATAKLYSM est un modèle d'intégrité dans le death metal . Jamais ce groupe ne s'est plié aux modes commerciales pour vendre + d'albums , ce qui n'a pas arrangé ses ventes , mais a contribué à en faire un groupe culte de 1er rang . De ses débuts aux limites du grind , KATAKLYSM en a gardé la rage , la puissance , ..... pour l'allier à + de finesse dans les compositions qui allient mid-tempo à tempo hyper rapide pour donner au final un résultat des + réussis .  Pour donner une formule consacrée , KATAKLYSM a vraiment atteint sa maturité et signe ici son chef d'oeuvre qui fera date dans l'histoire du death metal comme une de ses pièces essentielles . A possèder de toute urgence , donc !"
4,"Cet album est un vrai plaisir. je ne connaissais Eve que pour l'avoir entendu dans « we got that » sur l'album de Warren G « I want it all », et j'avais ete sidere par son flow rapide et detonnant. Et je n'ai pas ete decu. La qualite de ce flow percutant, qui lui a valu son succes, est constante sur ce CD. Eve est une des rares chanteuses de rap capable de tenir tete fierement au terrible DMX, comme elle le fait sur le tenebreux « Dog Match ». Chaque titre de cet album est dynamique, mais ce qui rend cet album MEILLEUR que les autres hurlements de Ruff Ryders est la presence de trois titres dans le style le plus pur de Eve :  1 - « Gotta Man », ou elle y expose l'amour et la passion d'une faccon inedite,  2 - « Love Is Blind », ou elle y condamne le comportement des hommes qui battent leur femme : ce titre est particulierement eprouvant ; la conviction d'Eve et son feminisme affirme en ont fait un modele pour les femmes aux US, chose rare dans le monde du Rap, 3 - « Watch'all  want », un tube remixe aux rythmes latinos particulierement original. Les interludes rivalisent egalement de qualite : on relevera notamment « my bitches », juste retour de baton au « my niggaz » de DMX ! On attend avec impatience d'autres performances explosives de Eve, sur un Ryde or Die Vol. 3, ou qui sait, un autre LP ?"
1,"C'est une horreur !!!!! Je ne peux pas croire que l'auteur de Thriller, Bad et autres chefs d'oeuvre puisse avoir pondu un truc aussi mauvais que cet album. Absolument rien à voir par rapport à la musique qui avait révélé son génie. Fan de MJ je me suis bêtement précipité sur cet album....bien mal m'en a pris. Les inconditionnels de cet néanmoins excellent artiste ne vous le procurez surtout pas... vous seriez inévitablement déçu......"
5,"Cet opus est un véritable chef-d'oeuvre! Techno-Thrash ( thrash technique avec un chant death, mais moins grave qu'avant, plus criard), plans quasi-jazzy, techniques, sur fond d'ambiance new age planantes et émotionnels! je sais que cet album a été boudé par les anciens fans, mais il vous plonge dans une sorte de coma spacial, une sphère (lol) encore jamais atteinte pour l'époque (on est en 1993)cet album est précurseur et autement inspiré! Leur sommet stylistique, assurément! une merveille! STUART"
2,"voici un exemple d'albums qui montre que l'on peut concilier les balades au pop, la voix de Richard Marx particulièrement travaillée rend cet album un modèle du genre... à avoir absolument chez soi, pour connaisseur averti"
1,"Ce disque a eu le plus d'impact sur la carrière musicale de Genesis, ai-je lu : en effet un impact dévastateur! Que dire à propos du vide? Et bien citer ""Invisible touch"" pour en donner une idée! Collins s'est découvert une nouvelle ""vertu"" : se faire le double d'Elton John et, si possible, réellement le doubler en matière de niaiseries, de néant musical. Collins ou l'esprit de pesanteur : toute sa musique raccoleuse tire vers le bas, s'enfonce dans la tourbe de la varièté calibrée pour le marché."
1,"Alors oui, c'est bien fait, ça tient parfaitement la route, parce que les gars de Metallica sont des pros, mais il n'y a aucune raison d'encenser cet album, qui n'est pas du tout un retour aux sources mais un repompage pur et simple de tout ce qu'ils ont fait précédemment. Sans doute parce que les fans ont vomis sur St Anger et réclamé un retour du Metallica qu'il connaissaient, le groupe a décidé de donner aux fans ce qu'ils voulaient dans leur grande magnificence (ö merci, grand yaka du combat contre le piratage). Et ben bonjour le résultat : les riffs sont carrément extraits des autres albums. Tout y passe, de Battery a One sans parler du Unforgiven et l'intro foireuse (ils ont dû enregistrer un môme qui faisait ses premières armes sur une guitare tant il y a de notes) qui ne renoue en rien avec les précédents albums, mais montre à quel point le groupe n'avait aucune envie de se prendre la tête à faire de nouvelles compositions. Autant écouter les originaux que cet auto-plagiat qui pue le commercial de bas étages, autant se refaire une opinion sur St Anger que mâcher un truc déjà digéré depuis longtemps. Cet album est un fiasco créatif total qui plaira certainement à beaucoup de monde (tant pis pour moi je serai seul avec ma critique), qui pourra servir d'introduction à ceux qui ne connaissent encore pas le groupe, mais qu'on ne vienne pas me dire que c'est le grand retour de Metallica. C'est artistiquement honteux, quelques soient les raisons qui ont poussé le groupe à faire ça. L'argent peut-être ? Allez savoir"
2,"Pour faire court: Death Magnetic est à peine moyen. Plutôt efficace dans sa première partie (mention spéciale au riff empli de groove de ""Broken, Beat &amp; Scarred"" et à certains passages qui donnent envie de headbanguer, certes sans génie, mais bon), mortellement ennuyeux et mal fagoté dans la seconde, tout ce semblant de gnaque retrouvée sonne au bout du compte forcé par manque d'inspiration générale. Aucun titre de l'album n'est réussi dans son intégralité, il faut se contenter de quelques passages sympas par-ci par-là. Hormis avec ""The Day that Never Comes"", premier single de l'album (tiens, tiens...), avec ses deux parties très contrastées mais aussi prenantes l'une que l'autre. Manque de bol, ""One"" avait déjà tout dit dans le domaine 20 ans auparavant. Metallica n'a-t-il plus rien à dire ? Finalement, au lieu de ce vilain fond blanc au fond du cercueil, z'auraient mieux fait d'y glisser la photo du groupe."
2,"Pas facile de poser un regard objectif sur un nouvel album de Trust tant ce groupe continue d'entretenir avec tous ses fans des années 80' un lien particulier. Il faut pourtant reconnaitre qu'après le bide de ""Ni dieu ni maître"" et le manque d'intéret total des trois nouveaux titres proposés sur ""Soulagez vous dans les urnes"" l'album de la reformation, ce nouvel album est bien loin de répondre encore une fois à l'attente du public de Trust. Il est loin en effet le temps du hard rock pour la bande à Bernie et l'on baigne plus ici dans une sorte de rap metal qui aura bien du mal à trouver son public. Alors bien sûr, il est difficile de rester insensible à la voix, aux mots et aux thèmes abordés par Bonvoisin, que l'on aimerait pourtant revoir retrouver la hargne d'antan, mais l'on se demande ce qu'un guitariste comme Nono qui ne jure que par le blues, que par Jeff Beck ou Jimi Page, peut bien faire dans ce désert musical,ce qu'un batteur comme Farid Medjane fait là et ce que vient faire un Dj qui n'apporte absolument rien à la musique de Trust. Alors on se dit dommage encore une fois et on espère que l'on retrouvera ce dont Trust est capable une prochaine fois. En attendant et à défaut de convaincre son public, on peut s'interroger sur qui peut bien aujourd'hui suivre Trust sur le chemin qu'il suit...Le nouveau AC-DC promis pour bientôt montra peut-être au bulldozer là où est son erreur et où ses fans l'attendent..."
1,"j'ai failli m'endormir à l'écoute de cet ""effort"" : on est loin du compte. stop, arrêtez tout les enfants, c'est ignoble à supporter."
2,"C'est l'album de la consécration pour Graham Coxon. En effet, salué par la critique, il permet enfin à celui-ci d'être reconnu comme un des plus grands musiciens de sa génération. Grande admiratrice du guitariste, j'attendais beaucoup de cet album après l'excellent « The kiss of morning » où le sieur Coxon déployait tout son talent d'auteur compositeur mélodiste. Et là, je ne peux cacher ma déception : ce ne sont que morceaux pop rock efficaces mais un peu trop lisses voire convenus. Graham nous avait habitué à plus d'originalité et d'audace. Quelques titres ont toutefois retenu mon attention comme« People of the earth » et « Are you ready ». Vocalement, Graham a gagné en justesse même s'il a, selon moi, perdu ce côté touchant que lui conférait une voix à la limite de la fausseté. Ce qui n'a pas changé, en revanche, c'est qu'il reste un multi instrumentiste épatant. En conclusion, vivement le prochain album !"
1,"Je trouve triste que ce vieux clown de Marc Moulin (animateur comique de la RTBF) se sente obligé de surfer sur la vague de l'electro jazz.Qu'il laisse ça à St germain et qu'il retourne animer une émission type ""Les grosses têtes"" ou encore écrire des chansons comme "" Les brunes comptent pas pour des prunes"" . La place aux jeunes papy!"
4,"Très grande musicalité, très bonne complémentarité, beaucoup d'inventivité par exemple dans le Stompin at the Savoy déjà tant de fois revisité. Bref un très bon moment de jazz, ni contemporain ni moderne ni classique ni quoi que ce soit mais tout simplement agréable."
2,"HURT vire sa cuti avec cet album plus proche du pop rock que de l'alternatif ... Les titres ""Pandora"" et ""Wars"" laissaient pourtant entrevoir un début prometteur mais très vite la suite va décevoir le fan de la première heure que je suis ... des ballades ""country"" qui laissent perplexe, mais le changement est déjà visible par le titre ""Goodbye to the machine"" et la pochette tout en couleur laisse présumer du pire ... En bref : qu'adviendra-t-il de ce changement de cap ? !"
2,"...pour un super groupe de scène ! Comment ont ils pu se rater à ce point, je pige pas. Ayant vu le groupe sur toutes leurs tournées depuis Whoracle (parfois plusieurs fois même) rien ne me préparait à ce pétard mouillé. Le son est pateux, l'ambiance inexistante...Reste un excellent setlist c'est certain, mais ça ne suffit pas. Heureusement, ils se rattraperont avec le live and abused, qui s'il comporte moins de vielleries, est beaucoup plus vivant...et c'est bien ça l'essentiel d'un live non ?"
5,"Est-ce que ""in Requiem"" est un bon album ? Sans l'ombre d'un doute....Un chef-d'oeuvre ?? aîe !!! Certainement pas !!    Je suis totalement partagé sur cet album...Le paradise Lost des années 2000 semble tellement dénué de toute ambition, alors que celui des années 90 était ENORME (que ce soit ""Gothic"" en 1991, ou ""Host"" en 1999, ce groupe avait de la prestance et s'en foutait pas mal de faire plaisir à ses fans...Une attitude que je respecte, mais qui n'a pas plus à grand monde à l'époque !!!)    Et pourtant...Ce ""In requiem"" est bourré de très bons moments, notamment ""Praise Lamented Shade"", ""Beneath Black Skies"" (Peter Steele n'est pas loin là...), ""Your Own Reality"" et surtout la génialissime, selon moi, ""Unreachable""...Pour le reste ça manque un peu de subtilité.    Je suis désolé, mais reécoutez le paradise Lost de la grande époque (pour aller vite on va dire Shades/Icon/Draconian) et vous verrez que ce n'était pas bourrin du tout !! Paradise Lost s'est toujours montré plus talentueux dans la ""douceur"" que dans le ""pur"" metal, c'est pourquoi ""One Second"" et ""Host"" ne dénaturent absolument pas dans leur discographie...A l'inverse du honteux ""Symbol of Life"", album opportuniste néo-metalisant au possible...Sur ""Draconian Times"", la moins bonne chanson était, et de loin, ""Once solemn""...Réecoutez ""Icon"", les sons de guitares sont certes heavy, mais ne sont pas du tout agressifs, d'où une impression générale de tranquilité lorsqu'on écoute des titres tels que ""Joys of the emptiness"" ou ""Remembrance"" (mes préférés de ""Icon""). Entous cas je suis totalement d'accord sur le fait que Paradise Lost a changé son discours depuis 2001/2002, à savoir qu'il saute à pieds joints dans tous les clichés qu'il a voulu éviter, et ce y compris dans certaines paroles, pltutôt en déçà de ce que Holmes avait écrit dans les 90's, tous albums confondus...N'oublions pas non plus le suicide commecial de ""Host"" qui a obligé nos 5 gars du Yorkshire à faire un peu marche arrière...Pour redevenir un peu rentable. Ca peut paraitre bête dit comme ça, mais c'est quand même bien ce qu'il s'est passé.    Depuis 2005, au moins, PL a retrouvé sa personnalité (qu'il a perdu dans les années 2000, et non dans leur EXCELLENTE période electro, toujours d'après moi évidemment), mais n'a toujours pas retrouvé son ambition....    Pas grave je suis patient...Bonne journée à tous !!!"
2,"Il ne faut pas se leurrer... Si ce n'était pas Metallica qui avait sorti cet album, il n'aurait jamais eu les 4 ou 5 étoiles que certains lui attribuent. Il existe des tonnes d'autres groupes, moins connus et ayant sortis des albums mieux produits et d'un niveau bien largement supérieur. Malheureusement, ces groupes ne peuvent pas se reposer sur un passé glorieux. Cet album n'est donc pas très bon, mais il conserve un soupçon d'originalité de part le virage à 180° effectué par Metallica. Dans le même genre, Slayer a beaucoup mieux réussi sa reconversion..."
2,"Pour ceux qui ne maitriseraient pas la langue de Shakespeare, letdown veut dire déception. Et à l'écoute de ce ""Tokyo Showdown"", c'est bien de déception qu'il s'agit! Et pourtant, il était quasiment impossible de décevoir... impossible n'est pas In Flames. Un album costaud, une tournée géniale (In Flames est un des meilleurs groupes de scène qu'il m'ait été donné de voir et les concerts de cette tournée auxquels j'ai assisté étaient intenses et dévastateurs), un setlist de folie, des moyens (le succès aidant, In Flames peut s'offrir des productions souvent impressionnantes)... Mais comment ont-ils fait pour se planter à ce point?  Une fois encore, certains fans sont incapables de dire du mal de leur groupe bien-aimé (aaahhh qu'il est difficile de rester objectif!)... et bien, je vais le faire pour eux: désolé, mais ce live enregistré au Japon ne restitue absolument ce qu'est un concert d'In Flames... et je sais de quoi je parle pour en avoir vu un paquet! Petit son, aucune ambiance (public oublié au moment du mixage?), les morceaux paraissent moins puissants que sur les albums studio, un comble! Si c'est pour écouter une sorte de best-of qui n'a rien d'un live, et qui contient des chansons moins dévastatrices (et moins bien produites) que sur album, je ne vois vraiment pas l'intérêt.  Les concerts d'In Flames sont comme de grosses claques dont on ne se remet pas immédiatement, en comparaison ce ""Tokyo Showdown"" est une petite pichenette, pas désagréable à écouter, mais bien en dessous de ce qu'on est en droit d'attendre d'un groupe qui maitrise pourtant si bien la scène. Ce n'est pas la honte non plus, et je comprends que ceux qui n'ont jamais eu la chance de voir In Flames en concert ne soient pas plus choqués que ça, mais ça reste tout de même petit... et vite oublié en ce qui me concerne. Mieux vaut se procurer ""Used and Abused"" (2e live du groupe) sorti en 2005, c'est quand même autre chose là!"
1,"il n'y a rien dans cet album !! aucun solo, pas de melodie, que du bourrin fait n'importe comment, moi qui etais un vrai fan, je peux dire aujourd'hui que j'en fais le deuil, on croirait qu'ils se foutent de nous !"

5,"Fan de la première heure du quatuor et ce depuis la création du groupe, j'ai longtemps hésiter à acheter cet album. Les nombreux commentaires que j'ai pu lire ou entendres n'étaient pas glorieux et puis je me suis dit : ""on est fan ou on ne l'est pas !!!"" et j'ai couru acheter ce tant critiqué ""Viva la vida"". Et je n'ai franchement pas été déçu les musiques sont toujours aussi excellente, et la voix de Chris Martin toujours aussi ""planante"". Certe Coldplay évolu, mais ils évoluent dans le bon sens. Bref n'écouter pas les critiques de personnes n'ayant entendus l'album qu'une seule fois, Coldplay s'apprécie dans la longueur et on ne s'en lasse pas. Quatres garçons dans le vent qui m'épateront toujours !!!."
5,"Tout simplement hallucinant de virtuosité, de talent, de technicité aussi, mais à la différence de certains prodiges électriques ou  dépourvus d'âmes, ces deux-là s'en donnent à coeur joie dans un duo complice qui fait merveille, et qui fait mouche à chaque fois dans nos oreilles. Etincelant, magique, et ""déprimant"" à la fois, quand on imagine les heures de travail pour arriver à un tel niveau."
2,"Barbra Streisand a beau être l'une des plus belles voix de la scène internationale, la magie n'opère pas sur cet album. On a l'impression que l'artiste a voulu contenir sa voix, chanter tout en douceur, avec retenue, comme pour prouver sa maîtrise vocale. On a aussi l'impression que le rythme de chaque chanson a été ralenti pour lui permettre de prolonger les notes plus que nécessaire. C'est sans doute impeccablement chanté techniquement parlant, mais certainement pas interprété: aucune expressivité, aucune émotion. Le résultat: d'un bout à l'autre de l'album on s'ennuie!"
5,"Metallica est un groupe génial que j'apprécie énormément. Les musiques qui sont assez longues (presque toutes aux alentours de 5 min) sont un régal pour les oreilles. Le fait qu'il n'y ait aucun solo dans cet album n'est pas un problème, puisque Métallica est un groupe qui sait répondre aux attentes musicales actuelles."

5,"La fin des 60's est resumee de facon anticipee par cet album au son inquietant.Gimmie Shelter est un nouveau sommet fascinant, alors que Midnight Rambler est fabuleusement derangeant (  il aurait influence le tueur en serie Charles Manson). Love In Vain fabuleusement arrangé. Par moment le son s'approche de la country (l influence de Gram Parson de Byrds sur Keith).  Live with me annonce les Stones des 70's, rythmique d enfer, Taylor a la lead... et You cant always get what you want deviendra un titre lui aussi legendaire... A achetez les yeux fermes"
1,"Insulte aux fans. À Serge. Aux interprêtes mêmes. Qu'est-ce qui les a donc possédés d'aller puiser en eux le pire, le plus mielleux, le plus ragoût-dégoûtant qui dégouline et colle aux dents ? Même Jane y est lamentable dans une Javanaise d'ascensseur, sans compter les arrangements dignes de ""La croisière s'amuse"" des Rita sur L'Hippopodame. À pleurer. Seul Rachid Taha sort du lot avec une interprétation, fidèle à lui-même, rageuse et engagée d'Aux Armes, Et Caetera. Merci Rachid. Un seul conseil : gravez la première piste et jouez au frisbee avec le reste pour au moins lui donner une raison d'être. Beurk."
2,"rien à redire sur le style musical par contre, anette n'est assurément pas au niveau ou alors, il faut que nightwish change de registre et se mette au new metal gothic, du style evanescence tous les fans le disent, nightwish, tel qu'on le connait, c'est avec tarja ou c'est avec personne anette et tarja n'ont tout simplement pas le même registre vocal et musical : rien de dramatique à ça, il suffit pour nightwish de composer ""pour"" anette pour s'en convaincre, il suffit d'écouter les performances live des reprises de l'ancien nightwish, interprétées par anette : une vraie catastrophe"
2,"Depuis la fin des années 60 avec le fameux ""With a little help from my friends"", Joe Cocker s'est fait le spécialiste des reprises avec une indéniable capacité à s'approprier ces chansons et à les transcender grâce à une voix (un rauque) unique. Ce nouvel album n'échappe à la règle puisqu'il n'y a ici que des reprises et toutes de morceaux de premier choix archi-connus (Marvin gaye, Aretha Franklin, U2, REM, John Lennon, Robert Palmer...).  Hélas, depuis les années 90, Joe Cocker s'est aussi fait le spécialiste des productions Rock FM peu inspirées, voire à côté de la plaque. Et ""Heart and soul"" n'échappe pas à la règle (""Jealous guy"" en version reggae !). Le pire est que Joe Cocker semble avoir perdu sa voix. Il eructe péniblement, au détriment de l'émotion qu'il faisait autrefois passer (""You are so beautiful""). Conscient du problème, Cocker a déclaré à la presse que l'album a été enregistré à Los Angeles l'année dernière, lorsque de grands incendies cernaient la ville, et que sa voix en a certainement pâti. Il confie que l'album aurait pu s'appeler ""The fire sessions"".  A son écoute, on se dit qu'il aurait plutôt dû ré-enregister sa partie quelques semaines plus tard... Remarque : Eric Clapton &amp; Jeff Beck à la guitare en guest, chacun sur un morceau."
1,"Avec ""Fragments"", Loudblast nous avait prouvé qu'il savait évoluer vers une musique plus accessible, moins Death mais surtout plus intéressante. Un grand album de Thrash, vraiment excellent. Le pas si attendu que ça ""Planet Pandemonium"" marque un retour en arrière dans la carrière du groupe. Retour à un Death Metal classique, un chant guttural classique, bref pas très original. Ce qui devait être le grand retour de Loudblast restera anecdotique."
2,"Radiohead se la joue avant-garde... Pourquoi pas ?  L'embêtant c'est que ""Kid A"" est plus ennuyeux que passionnant, plus prétentieux que réellement innovant... On a la triste impression d'écouter une musique informe - à la limite, parfois, du supportable. Où est passé le Thom Yorke de ""Street Spirit"", ""Exit Music"" ou ""Karma Police"" ? Radiohead est le plus grand groupe actuel ?... Oui, pour faire prendre à ses fans des vessies pour des lanternes !!"
2,"Peu de gens connaissent HJ. Ce best of est inégal, avec des titres de bonne facture (""New Song"",""I.G.Y"", ""What is love?"") et d'autres un peu moins. L'ensemble se laisse écouter, sans plus."
2,"Gryphon fait partie de cette catégorie de musique progressive tout-à-fait à part qu'est la progressive folk matinée de sonorités médiévales (allez plutôt lorgner du côté de Gentle Giant). Globalement l'ensemble est assez insupportable avec des bassons, des hautbois, des clavecins, des pipeaux (et j'en passe) et surtout des voix de soudards quasi insupportables. L'intérêt de ce type d'album est limité hormis le fait de mettre au goût du jour (nous sommes en 1973) des musiques d'un autre temps. Les références classiques peuvent avoir leurs limites. Par moment, on se retrouve plongé à la cours d'Henry VIII ou dans les brumes du Connemara mais globalement le charme ne fait pas effet. Pour puriste ou jouvenceaux en mal d'adoubement."
2,"C'est un album intérèssant pour les collectionneurs,mais musicalement je le déconseille au amateurs de mélodies de John Lennon ou des Beatles.Si on aime Yoko Ono,il y a des titres intéréssants chantés par elle en bonus."
2,le disc experimental de John le plus abouti. pour amateur avertis.
1,"Je dessine sur les nappes des restaurants, sur des bouts de papier (oui, je sais, j'ai une vie passionnante ^^), et mes neveux sont toujours éblouis par mes dessins. Je suis incapable de réussir les mains, suis nul pour la perspective, les visages sont approximatifs, mais tant que ce que je dessine ressemble, qu'on arrive à reconnaître, on me trouve doué. Grand Corps Malade, c'est un peu pareil. Le gars est sympathique, et en dîner de famille, je trouverais probablement ses textes formidables. Seulement, il n'est pas plus poète que je ne suis dessinateur.  Là où un Renaud manie un argot compréhensible par tous, réinvente la langue chantée, GCM est scotché à sa banlieue et n'en décolle jamais. C'est le petit phénomème de son quartier, plus doué que la moyenne, certes, assez pour éblouir ses petits copains, mais pas suffisamment pour enregistrer un disque, ni pour qu'on se déplace pour aller le voir sur scène. Sa poésie n'est pas celle de la rue, mais celle du trottoir, et voir combien on l'apprécie, c'est constater à quel point nous avons perdu le contact avec la poésie de Victor Hugo, Baudelaire et Rimbaud."
5,je suis trés heureux de donner mon onpinion sur ce succeé de cheb MAMI:c'est un bon album qui trés me plait et j'espere roncontrer mami et ME CHANTER la chanson :BELAH YA RAZALI NRSEL MAAC KITAB
4,"Les enregistrements disponibles sur le label Gala méritent assez souvent que l'on s'y intéresse. Cet enregistrement de l'autre chef-d'œuvre de Bizet date de juin 1959 et même s'il est moins bon que l'enregistrement officiel de 1961 paru chez EMI, il a certaines qualités. Zurga est ici chanté par le fantastique Gabriel Bacquier tandis que Nadir chanté par Alain Vanzo ne démérite pas, loin de là. Leïla est chantée, comme dans l'autre version, par Janine Micheau.  Les bonus sont trois quarts d'heure d'airs chantés par Alain Vanzo : du Gounod («Faust» en 1958, «Roméo et Juliette» en 1964, «Mireille» en 1959), du Verdi («Les Vêpres siciliennes» en 1964 et «Don Carlos» en 1961) puis du Massenet («Manon» en 1960). Bien sûr, comme toujours chez Gala, il n'y a pas de livret."
2,"Je m'attendais à des morceaux d'opérette chantés par F. Lott, or il y en a très peu, les autres ne sont que des musiques symphoniques. La prise de son est de mauvaise qualité, et même pour un prix si bas on pouvait espérer mieux."
2,"Ryuichi Sakamoto, pianiste et compositeur atypique à souhait, a souvent fait voisiner dans son aeuvre traits de génie et fautes de goût. La plupart de ses albums (à l'exception peut-être des coups de maître Casa, 1996 et Back to the Basics), sont souvent des patchworks inégaux et déconcertants, croisements de pop et de musique symphonique expérimentale, de traitements électroniques et d'épure pianistique, qui suscitent néanmoins toujours la curiosité, voire la passion inconditionnelle. Beauty, Discord ou Smoochy sont de ceux-là.  Mais hélas, dans ce Sweet Revenge, Sakamoto s'embourbe le temps d'un album entier dans une soupe pop/house/R'n B très indigeste. La pochette en dit long (le boa géant...) et le contenu sonore est à l'avenant. Après une vignette expérimentale qui intrigue en guise d'ouverture (« Tokyo Story »), on espère de bonnes choses mais les premiers morceaux peinent à séduire durablement et ne résistent pas à une poignée d'écoutes : « Moving on » qui annonce la couleur (kitsch) concernant la ménagerie instrumentale déployée (claviers-guimauve et boites à rythmes à l'honneur) ou « Sentimental », chanson nasale et répétitive. Un sursaut R'n B plus énergique (« Regret ») tente de redresser la barre, mais comment ne pas se lasser rapidement d'une ritournelle aussi fade et finalement agaçante ? A partir de « Pounding at my heart » puis ""Love and Hate"" (qui ferait son effet dans un nightclub tokyoïte pour dépressifs insomniaques), c'est le naufrage. L'oncle Ryuichi déballe sans mollir des morceaux sans aucun relief, au format invariable (entre quatre et cinq minutes), qui mettent les invités-chanteurs au supplice. Il faut dire que les textes, dignes d'un journal intime de collégien, ne poussent pas à la performance vocale. Seul le court et sexy « 7 seconds » (avec une clarinette basse fantomatique sur un groove efficace) permet de s'échapper brièvement de ce disque-somnifère, dont l'aspect robotique n'est pas racheté par les sonorités électro aux allures de jets de vapeur (façon fête foraine)... Bref, un album dispensable sauf pour les fans inconditionnels (ou très indulgents) de l'insaisissable Sakamoto, décidément capable du meilleur comme du pire !"
1,"J'attendais beaucoup de ce groupe qu'on m'avait dépeint comme un clone de NIGHTWISH. Le problème est que c'est du sous-sous-Nightwish !! Production médiocre, chanteuse sans feeling, mélodies non accrocheuses, on a l'impression qu'il s'agit là de travail d'amateur ! La conccurence est rude dans le domaine du gothique et ce n'est pas cet album là qui fera un carton, désolé pour eux, mais c'est loin d'être abouti ! Il va falloir que le groupe revoit sa copie !"
4,"Les Beatles ne sont pas à une contradiction près mais bon... Ce disque est une compilation créée de toute pièce récemment pour la ressortie en vidéo et DVD du dessin animé ""Yellow submarine"". Estimant que la première bande originale du film sortie en 1969 était une arnaque (ce qui est le moins qu'on puisse dire), estimant sans doute aussi qu'il y avait des choses intéressantes à faire (surtout des bénéfices), Les Beatles (enfin les survivants de l'aventure) ont décidé de ressortir une vraie bonne bande originale du dessin animé. Celle-ci contient toutes les chansons (mais pas les instrumentaux) qu'on entend dans le dessin animé. C'est bien le role d'une BO, non?. Ces morceaux ont été entièrement remasterisés.   Estimer que la première bande originale était une arnaque pour le Fan c'est bien, mais est ce que cette nouvelle compilation n'en est pas une non plus? En fait ca dépend... On se trouve ici en présence d'un disque qui aurait mérité de porter le nom d''Anthology' puisqu'il rassemble quelques unes des meilleures compositions sorties par les Beatles sur la période 1965-1967. Pour un néophyte qui voudrait s'acheter une sorte de 'Best Of' de cette période, sans être exhaustive, cette BO est vraiment bien. Pour les autres, ceux qui ont déja, ou qui comptent s'acheter des 'Best Of' ou les albums de la période couverte, où est l'intérêt? ah, oui! Il y a des versions remasterisées. C'est gentil, ce concept de remastérisés, mais on a déja jeté tous nos vinyls, toutes nos cassettes audio, va-t-il falloir jeté nos CD de l'ancienne époque? Stop! Un 'remaster' sera uniquement valable pour un fan du 'nec plus ultra Audio' mais pour ceux qui veulent juste écouter de la musique, les albums CD non-remasterisés sont parfaits. De toute façon, tous les albums des Beatles sortiront remasterisés d'ici peu... En résumé, pour celui qui n'a jamais eu un album des Beatles et qui va écouter celui-ci, ce disque sera parfait, les chansons étant presque toutes excellentes. Mais est-ce qu'un 'Best of' plus exhaustif comme les Doubles 'rouge' et 'bleu' ne serait pas plus valables? Certainement..."
5,"Le première suite ""crossover music"" de Claude Bolling. Elle date de 1975 mais elle n'a pas pris une ride. ""Baroque and blue"", le premier mouvement, est superbe. Il débute sur un thème aux couleurs baroques, et soudain, le jazz fait son incursion. De la grande musique !"
5,"Une superbe compilation des chansons en suedois d'Agnetha (artiste reconnue en Suede avant d'integrer le groupe qui va la rendre celebre sur le plan international) qui montre le talent d'une voix d'exception et aussi d'un excellent auteur-compositeur puisque presque tous les titres ont ete ecrit par Agnetha. Cette compilation est aussi valable puisqu'elle inclut un ""inedit"" (en 1979, tout du moins): une chanson ecrite et enregistree pendant la periode ABBA, ""Nar Du Tar Mej I Din Famn"" (Quand Tu Me Prends Dans Tes Bras) est un petit bijou et est consideree comme un classique par les fans du groupe... Enjoy!"
1,"Pas d'accord avec nos amis Luc et Ramone, ce double cd remasterisé est vraiment mauvais. Coverdale et Hughes se tirent la ""bourre"" contamment d'ailleurs j'ai l'impression que c'est Hughes qui chante le plus. Smoke OTW chanté par Coverdale : une honte. Je me suis vraiment ennuyé à l'écoute de ce concert : double cd rangé et on en parle plus, merci."
4,"Avis aux amateurs de blues authentique, l'album d'Eric Sardinas Devil's Train est indispensable.Le guitariste porte sur le dos un tatouage:""Respect Tradition"" ce qui en dit beaucoup sur sa musique.Le blues d'Eric Sardinas est puissant et très dur: son jeu de guitare survolté et basé sur le slide fait de lui le fils spirituel de Johnny Winter; quant à sa voix, elle est d'une grande expressivité (le moins qu'on puisse dire c'est qu'il chante avec ses trippes !).Bref, nous sommes en présence d'un artiste dotté d'une très forte personnalité qui nous offre un album très réussi (son style de blues assez sombre ne plaira peut-être pas à tout le monde...)."
4,"Décidemment, Anticon tape toujours aussi fort! (Enfin, façon de parler puisque leurs livraisons ont plus à voir avec l'ambient qu'avec le rap). Donc Boom Bip, cette fois-ci chez les alter-ego de Lex, publie un album au son dont il a le secret. Seules les présences de Buck65 et de Dose One (décidemment inimitable) valent à ce disque une quelconque appellation Hip-Hop. Ceci est de la musique, tout simplement. Ecoutez le dernier morceau si vous ne le croyez pas."
5,"Effectivement dignes héritières des Girlschool, Crucified Barbara est un groupe suédois 100% féminin formé en 1998 à Stockholm dont le line-up actuel est composé de Mia Coldheart (Chant/Guitare), Nicki Wicked (Batterie), Klara Force (Guitare) et Ida Evileye (Bass).  ""In Distorsion We Trust"" est leur premier album sorti en 2005, dont il ressort un heavy-métal savamment dosé entre NWOBHM de la grande époque agrémenté d'une touche de modernité. Ici, pas de fioritures, on va directement à l'essentiel. Compos simples et efficaces taillées sur mesure, pas de remplissage, tous les titres sont dignes de figurer dans le set d'un concert... Autant dire que les demoiselles ne font pas dans la dentelle ! Le cd ""Spécial Edition"" nous crédite de 3 titres bonus, avec une sympathique version acoustique de ""My Heart Is Black"" suivi de deux bonnes reprises; l'excellent ""Killed By Death"" de Mötorhead et le très Glam-Rock ""Shout It Out Loud"" de Kiss. Un dvd en prime nous présente le groupe au jour le jour (Extraits de concerts, séance photos...). Bref, un album à écouter d'urgence pour tous les nostalgiques des rares groupes de heavy-métal de qualité estampillé filles. Crucified Barbara se pose d'ores et déjà comme LA référence incontournable dans le style..."
1,"Ce live, en dépit du mixage avantageux mais totalement artificiel de la guitare de Keith offrent des versions molles et flottantes du répertoire des Stones. C'est mou, sans riff (un comble), on est à des années lumière de la flamboyance et de la folie scénique des années Taylor..."
1,"Ce CD est loin d'être un CD musical! Il s'agit en fait d'une biographie audio de Cher, sans chansons, mais avec des interviews de Cher. Si l'on est parfaitement bilingue anglais cela doit être intéressant. Les titres sont des titres de chanson de Cher, sans aucun rapport. Un conseil, Fan de Cher, abstiens-toi!"
1,"Bon ,je suis fan de Metallica depuis 1982...Donc que dire...Y'a pas a triturer,il ont perdu la flamme ou je ne sais quoi mais c'est plus comme avant: James n'a plus le meme timbre qu'avant,cette hargne...quand il veut pousser un peu,tout de suite il s'essoufle,sature,on dirait qu'il a ""mué"". Le son des grattes n'est plus LE son du ""Black Album ""ou de ""Justice"",se son acide...le gros son qui vous plaque au mur!!! Kirk nous fait toujours le meme solo depuis 20 ans en utilisant beaucoup(trop) sa wah-wah,mais sans inspiration.Ou sont passer les mega solos de ""Fade to black"",""Orion"",""One ""??? Lars est un peu trop en avant,il joue très bien certe,mais on entend que lui. Quand au bassiste il n'est pas assez present je trouve. Ca tourne en rond on a l'impression qu'ils on mis bout a bout des riffs,des idées,les morceaux sont trop long ,trop repetitifs.Des melodies faciles ,presque nian-nian(The day that never comes!!franchement pour trouver le theme ,y ont pas du chercher bien longtemps!!!). Les vocaux de James ne colle pas avec la zic.A la rigueur je trouve que ""St anger"" sonnait p'tetre mieux au niveau des compos,bon certes il y avait ce son de batterie execrable quoi q'interressant ,mais sur 1 morceau,pas sur tout un album!! Moi personnellement j'ai decrocher depuis le Black album qui est encore très bien,mais quand meme rien a voir avec ""Justice"" ou ""Master""...Il ya eu heureusement ""Garage inc."" qui etait très bien..mais bon ..facile le coup des reprises... Bref je ne sais pas pourquoi tous ces groupes essaye encore de vouloir préssé les quelques gouttes du citron qui peuvent encore en sortir. Quand on a pondu des albums magnifique,de legendes pourquoi tout gacher.Faut pas se leurer,ils n'ont plus d'idées,d'inspiraton,qu'ils en reste la ,sur une bonne impression!!!(Metallica,joe satriani,Deep purple,Def lep,Ozzy...) Pour moi de toute facon c'est clair,un bon morceau,c'est un morceau ""intemporel"",j'entends par la un morceau que l'on peut ecouter dans 20 ans et qui sonnera ""frais"",qui ne nous lasse malgré les nombreuses ecoutes,qui n'aura pas vieilli,que l'on reconnait dés la premiere ecoute,que ce soit la voix du chanteur,le son ou le toucher d'un guitariste....(ex:Stayin' alive,roxanne,Highway to hell,Seventh son,eruption... Si vous ecouter ""And justice for all""(qui a 20 ans cette année)on dirait qu'il est d'actualité,alors que les titres de ""death magnetic"" ca m'etonnerai beaucoup qu'on en parle encore dans 20 ans..."
5,"Avec cet album méconnu, c'est tout le grand art des deux frères guitaristes qui se révèle dans ce programme de musiques sud-américaines. On pourra goûter sans modération les belles harmonies, les trouvailles instrumentales, le terrible moteur rythmique et la poésie de ce Duo d'exception. à découvrir!"
2,"A quelques rares exceptions, Quo n'a produit que de albums médiocres depuis ""never too late (qui est excellent) en 1981.
